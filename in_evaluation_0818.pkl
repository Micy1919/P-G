S"One of the original hot hatches, now at the end of its road.\n  2015 GTI \nImage Credit: Murilee Martin\nThe second-generation Volkswagen Golf made its United States debut for the 1985 model year, ditching the old Rabbit name for the occasion. These cars sold very well in California, and that's where I found this worn-out-and-discarded red GTI.\n The GTI badges have been pried off, but the VIN checks out as a genuine, Westmoreland-built 1985 Volkswagen GTI.\n I was a freshman in college in Southern California in 1985, and the new GTI was the car all the rich kids got for their high-school graduation that year (the really rich kids got Mercedes-Benz 500SLs, this being the era of lots of dirty S&L money flying around Orange County). I drove a 351W-swapped 1968 Mercury Cyclone that year, and my car accelerated much better than a GTI but was dismissed as a relic of the past. Which it was.\n Not quite 200,000 miles on the clock.\n The US-market 1985 GTI got an 8-valve, 1.8-liter engine making 100 horsepower. That seems like not much power today, but remember that the fairly quick 1985 Honda Civic Si had a mere 91 horses.\n It's not a car. It's a Volkswagen.\n"

S'Fashion keeps changing while style remains constant. This week our celebrities have chosen style before trends and fashion and they look fabulous. While one or two might not pass our fashion radar, the majority looks we adore. Have a look at our this week\xe2\x80\x99s fashion report card:\nHansika Motwane\nShe is busy setting vacation goals for us. While the last look we decoded was a punk-ish one, here she goes ultra chic. A lemon yellow strapy maxi dress with an oh-so fashionable hat, this is a super cute outfit. She accessorised the attire with over sized sunglasses and a back pack.\nKajol\nThe ensemble is by Label Anushree which is a 10 on 10 for Kajol. The cut and the layers make the look very fresh and at the same time hides what\xe2\x80\x99s to be hidden. The play of a darker colour inside and a printed neutral gives an illusion of a sleek figure. Like this one on Kajol.\nPriya Anand\nBusy promoting her forthcoming movie, Priya was spotted wearing an Indian outfit by Jayanti Reddy. Its a beautiful colour but seems like a bit too much with the high neck and the sleeves. Also the bottom could have been a different shade, which might have balanced the play of colours. While she does look pretty, the outfit is too much for the eyes.\nTaapsee Pannu\nShooting for her Bollywood movie Judwaa 2, Taapsee was seen looking hot as a summer day. The blue bikini, the net dress, the side parted hair and the funky earrings, all fit her attitude very well. She pulls off the swimsuit look with so much confidence and style.\nAmy Jackson\nBlue jeans, white top and a classic leather jacket, this one is the perfect look for a day out. Amy looks cool, sassy and so fresh in this outfit. Casual yet stylish, this young lady knows how to keep it rolling.\n'

S'(AFP Photo)\n BUDAPEST: Lewis Hamilton\'s heart spoke louder than his mind at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, and sportsmanship was the winner. \n By handing back third place to Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas on the final lap, the Formula One title contender made a gesture that cost him a podium and precious points but won him plaudits. \n  "I want to win the championship the right way and I don\'t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not," he said. \n "I do think today was the right way to do things." \n Going into the race one point behind Ferrari\'s Sebastian Vettel, Hamilton saw the gap at the top stretch to 14 points after the German chalked up his fourth victory of the season. \n It would have been an 11-point difference had Hamilton, a triple world champion and the second most successful Formula One driver of all time after Michael Schumacher in terms of race wins, shown a more selfish streak. \n Bottas had let his faster team mate through with 25 laps remaining, on the understanding that the positions would be reversed if the British driver failed to pass the Ferraris ahead on a track where overtaking is famously difficult. \n Hamilton had plenty of excuses to press on to the chequered flag as Bottas fell more than seven seconds behind, chased closely by Red Bull\'s Max Verstappen with the risk of the Dutchman passing both if the Briton slowed too much. \n The team-to-car radio had also been faulty, making communication difficult throughout the race. \n Hamilton, though, said he knew what he had to do, and did it. \n Asked afterwards whether he had listened to his head or his heart, he pointed to the latter. \n "I think more from the heart, probably," he said. \n "The mind is more cut-throat and every point counts and this is do-or-die. My heart tells me the right thing to do was to let Valtteri past. \n "I think today really shows, hopefully, that I am a man of my word, and also that I am a team player. I am just as much a part of this team as anyone and I think we\'re working together better than we ever had, so I think today shows unity. \n "I think, in life, you do good things and good things do come round back to you." \n For the last three seasons the title battle has been an internal one, with Hamilton fighting his now-retired team mate and 2016 champion Nico Rosberg, but this year has brought a new outside challenge in Vettel. \n While Ferrari have made little secret that the four-times champion is their main man, with Kimi Raikkonen chafing behind him in second place on Sunday, Mercedes have been firm about equal opportunities. \n "Me and Valtteri have a great amount of respect for each other," said Hamilton. \n "Just as the team asked him to do a job and he did it, the same rules apply to me." \n'

S'Originally published on Bullionstar.com\nMy best estimate as of June 2017 with respect to total above-ground gold reserves within the Chinese domestic market is 20,193 tonnes. The majority of these reserves are held by the citizenry, an estimated 16,193 tonnes; the residual 4,000 tonnes, which is a speculative yet conservative estimate, is held by the Chinese central bank, the People\'s Bank of China.\nI\'m aware I\'ve been absent from writing about the Chinese gold market for a long time, so for some of you, it can be burdensome to pick up where we left a few months ago. It is not feasible for me to explain the entire structure of the Chinese gold market again; my suggestion would be to follow the links provided in the text for more background info. Most knowledge is covered in previous BullionStar posts, Mechanics Of The Chinese Domestic Gold Market, Chinese Cross-Border Gold Trade Rules, Workings Of The Shanghai International Gold Exchange.\nTo substantiate my estimates on above-ground gold reserves in China mainland, we\'ll first discuss private gold accumulation in China through the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), after which we\'ll address official purchases by the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) and its proxies that operate in the international over-the-counter market.\nChinese Private Gold Accumulation\nA few days ago, you could read on the BullionStar Gold Market Charts page that withdrawals from the vaults of SGE in June accounted for 156 tonnes. Year to date SGE withdrawals have reached 984 tonnes, which is 16% shy of the record year 2015 when 1,178 tonnes were withdrawn by this time. Since 2013, gold demand in China has remained extremely elevated - don\'t let the World Gold Council tell you anything different - which exposes spectacular years of physical gold accumulation by the Chinese.\nExhibit 1.\nThe amount of SGE withdrawals provides a fairly good proxy for Chinese wholesale gold demand, although not all gold passing through the SGE adds to above-ground reserves. In China, most scrap supply and disinvestment flows through the Shanghai bourse as well, next to mine output and imports. Needless to say, recycling gold within China doesn\'t change the volume of above-ground reserves. So, simply using SGE withdrawals won\'t fly for calculating above-ground reserves. What we\'re interested in are net imports and mine production in the Chinese domestic gold market.\nAlthough gold exports from the Chinese domestic market are prohibited, exports from the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ), where the Shanghai International Gold Exchange (SGEI) is located, are permitted. Before calculating Chinese net imports, let\'s have a brief look at exports from the SFTZ - which reflects to what extent the SGEI is developing as a physical gold hub in Asia. As far as I can see, China\'s gold bullion export from the SFTZ is still negligible. From the United Nations\' international merchandise trade statistics service COMTRADE, it shows the only countries that have imported tiny amounts from China in 2017 are the UK and India. But the amounts are so small, they carry little importance for our analysis.\nThere is one region that is importing significant amounts of gold from China, which is Hong Kong, though, this likely isn\'t exported from the SFTZ but from the Shenzhen Free Trade Zone. The vast majority of China\'s jewellery manufacturers are in Shenzhen, and for quite some years, gold jewellery, ornaments, industrial and semi-manufactured parts are being exported from this Chinese fabrication base to Hong Kong. These events haven\'t got anything to do with the SGEI in my opinion. Thereby, Hong Kong exports far more gold to China than vice versa.\nFor computing net gold export from Hong Kong to China, we\'ll subtract "imports into Hong Kong from China" from "exports and re-exports from Hong Kong to China" (as you know China doesn\'t disclose gold trade statistics itself). Imports into Hong Kong accounted for 23 tonnes while exports and re-exports to China accounted for 333 tonnes. Accordingly, China net imported 311 tonnes from Hong Kong in the first five months of 2017.\nExhibit 2. In 2016 rumours circulated Hong Kong\'s elevated gold exports relative to gold re-exports possibly hinted at fallacious trade data. This year the numbers show no sign of such activities.\nIf we apply the same math to Switzerland\'s customs data, it shows China net imported 172 tonnes from the Swiss in the first six months of this year.\nMost definitely Australia has exported gold bullion directly to China in 2017 as well, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has changed its methodology regarding this data somewhere in 2016 and is reluctant to share the details with me. Using my old way to compute Australia\'s export directly to China results in 23 tonnes (this number is provisional and will be amended).\nThe UK, a large gold exporter directly to China in 2014 and 2015, hasn\'t shipped any gold directly to China year to date, according to Eurostat.\nExhibit 3. Annualised Chinese gold import for 2017 stands at 1,159 tonnes.\nWhat\'s remarkable is that Chinese true gold demand is far greater than what the World Gold Council (WGC) and GFMS are reporting as "Chinese consumer gold demand". This is due to incomplete metrics applied by the WGC and GFMS. The immense tonnages imported by China have been waived in previous years by the aforementioned Western consultancy firms with dishonest arguments. In reality, thousands of tonnes are being imported into China and this metal is not coming back in the foreseeable future, causing a bull run on steroids if institutional interest for gold rebounds in the West. Ascending above ground reserves within China imply declining above-ground reserves in the rest of the world. And the more scarce the metal in the West, the higher price when demand revives. I\'ve described this phenomenon in my previous post How The West Has Been Selling Gold Into A Black Hole. In forthcoming posts I will add more texture to my analysis.\nDomestic mine production in China is not allowed to be exported, effectively all output can be added to above-ground reserves. The China Gold Association (CGA) wrote on April 28, 2017, that Chinese domestic mine output in the first quarter accounted for 101 tonnes. Lacking the data for the second quarter makes me estimate mine production from January until June by doubling 101, which is 202 tonnes. By the way, the CGA added:\nGold is a special product with the dual attribute of general commodity and currency. It is the cornerstone of important global strategic assets and the national financial reserve system. It plays an irreplaceable role in safeguarding national financial stability and economic security.\nBased on data publicly available, in the first six months of 2017, China net imported at least 506 tonnes into the domestic market and mined 202 tonnes. An addition of 707 tonnes to Chinese private gold reserves.\nChinese Official Gold Purchases\nI can be short on PBOC gold purchases: the Chinese central bank does not buy any gold through the SGE - its increments must be treated in addition to all visible flows - and it buys in secret not to disturb the global market. I\'ve shared my analysis regarding the PBOC buying gold through proxies in the international over-the-counter (OTC) market for several years on these pages. Although, my reasoning has been confirmed countless times, it\'s worth noting it was affirmed once more not long ago.\nEarly 2017, world renowned gold analyst Jim Rickards was in a meeting with the three heads of the precious metals trading desks of largest Chinese bullion banks. These gold dealers told Rickards that indeed the PBOC does not buy any gold through the SGE. Rickards stated in the Gold Chronicles podcast published January 17, 2017 (at 25:00) [brackets added by Koos Jansen]:\nWhat I [J. Rickards] don\'t know is about the Shanghai Gold Exchange sales, they\'re pretty transparent, how much of that is private and how much of that is the government [PBOC]. And I was sort of guessing 50/50, 70/30, whatever. What they told me, and these guys are the dealers [the three heads of the precious metals trading desks], it\'s 100 % private. Meaning, the government operates through completely separate channels. The government does not operate through the Shanghai Gold Exchange. \xe2\x80\xa6 None of what\'s going on on the Shanghai Gold Exchange is going to the People\'s Bank Of China.\nIn fact, the PBOC uses Chinese banks as proxies to buy gold in countries like the UK, Switzerland and South Africa after which the metal is transhipped to Beijing. Note monetary gold shipments do not show up in customs reports of any country.\nI haven\'t come across any clues in the past months that have changed my estimate on the PBOC\'s true official gold reserves. My best substantiated guess still is 4,000 tonnes (in contrast, the PBOC publicly discloses it holds about 1,840 tonnes). For more information on how and when the PBOC stacked up to 4,000 tonnes, continue reading at the BullionStar Gold University.\nEstimated Total Gold Reserves China 20,000 Tonnes\nLet us put the pieces of the puzzle together. We know the PBOC doesn\'t buy gold though the SGE, but prior to 2007, the Chinese gold market wasn\'t fully liberalized and back then the PBOC was primary dealer in the domestic market. Any PBOC purchases prior to 2007 could have been from Chinese gold mines. What else do we know? China is said to be a gold importer since the 1990s, suggesting domestically mined gold was not exported after, say, 1994. In the next screen shot from the China Gold Market Report 2010, we can read "China has been a gold importer since the 1990s".\nExhibit 4. Courtesy China Gold Market Report 2010\nFor the sake of simplicity, we\'ll calculate from 1994 onwards. Precious Metals Insights (PMI) has estimated that 2,500 tonnes of gold jewellery were held by the Chinese population in 1994. Furthermore, I have data on Chinese non-monetary gold import starting in 2001 - which started slowly but ramped up in 2010 (exhibit 2).\nIn 1994 PBOC official reserves accounted for 394 tonnes and Chinese domestic mine output accounted for 90 tonnes. So, our starting point in 1994 is:\n2,500 (jewellery base) + 394 (official reserves) + 90 (mining) = 2,984 tonnes\nFrom here, we can aggregate domestic mine output and net imports for every succeeding year. As stated above, my assumption is that the PBOC sourced its official gold from domestic mines prior to 2007, but shifted these acquisitions to the international market after 2007. The official gold increments in 2001 (105 tonnes) and 2003 (100 tonnes) I\'ve subtracted from "aggregate domestic mine output", and the increments in 2009 (454 tonnes) and onwards I did not subtract from "aggregate domestic mine output".\nThe previous calculation has resulted in the following chart:\nExhibit 5. Aggregate net import reflects non-monetary gold.\nIn the chart the green, blue and grey bars represent private gold reserves, and summed up account for an estimated 16,193 tonnes at the time of writing. The red bars reflect the PBOC\'s official gold reserves - I would like to stress this number is speculative - and currently account for 4,000 tonnes. My best estimate as of June 2017 for total above-ground gold reserves within the Chinese domestic market is 20,193 tonnes.\n'

S' They could either be of people who died in the 1950 crash or in the 1966 one. \nDaniel Roche/AFP\nA man claims he found body parts of passengers who died in one of the two Air India plane crashes from more than 50 years ago in the French Alps, AFP reported on Friday. Daniel Roche, who has spent years looking for remains in the Bossons Glacier on the Mont Blanc peak, made the discovery on Thursday.\nRoche found a human hand and the upper part of a leg. \xe2\x80\x9cI had never found any significant human remains before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nIn 1950, an Air India flight carrying 48 people had crashed in the French Alps. In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 heading to New York from Mumbai, then Bombay, had crashed near Mont Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s summit. All 117 people on board had died in the crash. \nRoche said the remains could be of a female passenger from the 1966 crash. He also discovered one of the plane\xe2\x80\x99s four jet engines (pictured above).\nThe aviation enthusiast contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix Valley on making the discoveries, which will now be examined by experts. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThese remains are probably not from the same person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephane Bozon, a local official. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are probably from passengers, but between the two aircraft, it is difficult to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'It\xe2\x80\x99s time for army wives to fix their petty hierarchies\nAny Awwa experience, an army wife will tell you, depends entirely upon the woman who runs it. Photo: iStockphoto.\nDoe Nair\xe2\x80\x99s first ladies club parade was a disaster. She only realized why her fellow army wives were greeting her unenthusiastically and whispering about her when the COW arrived. The commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife walked down the line in her gold necklace and scarlet chiffon sari, inspecting the ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cShe then came to me and turned the colour of her sari,\xe2\x80\x9d Nair writes in I Married The Army, a rollicking portrait of army life in the 1960s, and one that officers still recommend for newbie military spouses. \n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A cotton,\xe2\x80\x99 she shrieked\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x98No, no, only chiffons. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the commander\xe2\x80\x99s wife (one step higher in the hierarchy) has ordered only chiffons are to be worn.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d When Nair later bumped into that senior wife at that event, she laughingly denied instituting any such rule. Later, Nair\xe2\x80\x99s husband was hauled up for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanours. Ensure your spouse is docile, pleasing, and not argumentative, he was informed.\nNair\xe2\x80\x99s story about the pecking order that exists among army wives begins her book, and though much has changed since then, every once in a while we are reminded that the Army Wives Welfare Association (Awwa), the bastion of all these hierarchies, remains in need of a drastic makeover.\nThe New Indian Express reported last week that during a ceremonial event at the Bathinda military station, the wife of a commanding officer slapped the wife of a Lieutenant Colonel for coming late to an Awwa event. The Lieutenant Colonel has complained to everyone, from the Prime Minister to the National Human Rights Commission and the CBI director, the newspaper reported.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven our phones and gadgets get regular upgrades\xe2\x80\x94maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for an upgrade/update in the existing hierarchy amongst army wives,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted author and army wife Aditi Mathur Kumar, who is one of the more outspoken members of this tribe.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that a spouse has shared her frustration about the restrictions imposed by military life. In 2014, a wife complained that her husband\xe2\x80\x99s Brigade Commander harassed and threatened her when she objected to participating in an Awwa fashion show. In 2009, one wife alleged in a legal notice that her husband was given below-average ratings in his annual appraisal report because of her lack of enthusiasm for Awwa activities. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should a jawan\xe2\x80\x99s wife perform for visiting officers? Would you perform for your bosses?\xe2\x80\x9d asks former army wife Rosme Chaube, who went public with her complaints about Awwa around the same time. Chaube and her Major husband left the army three years after she first complained to the chief. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you complain, everyone ostracizes you. Nobody will talk to you, nobody will call you,\xe2\x80\x9d she tells me over the phone.\nSo what is this group that has such a hold on wives? It\xe2\x80\x99s a welfare organization headed by the army chief\xe2\x80\x99s wife that was set up to keep an eye out for the families of the troops. Membership is mandatory for all wives of serving officers. \nIt can be a source of great camaraderie for the women living in an isolated cantonment. Their husbands had years of training to prepare for the army, but many of the wives may not have even known what they were getting into when they signed up to be a military spouse.\nAwwa provides support in a medical emergency, help with school admissions, can work to improve health and hygiene standards of military families and offer investment advice. Its members have even been known to raise funds to help one of their own make a down-payment on a house. One of its main goals is the rehabilitation of war widows. \nYet it can easily disintegrate into battles about dress codes and decorating duties for parties. The rules that govern who can say what to whom haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed since Nair\xe2\x80\x99s days in the army. Not attending a party is not an option. Any Awwa experience, an army wife will tell you, depends entirely upon the woman who runs it.\nSometimes the conflict can remind you of that most cliched of urban wars: the mother-in-law vs the daughter-in-law, where the younger woman eventually ends up mirroring the actions of the hierarchy-conscious older woman and nothing ever changes. It\xe2\x80\x99s the standard syllabus from the I-did-it-and-so-will-you school of power relationships.\nOne Facebook post titled \xe2\x80\x9c11 things to know if you are an army wife\xe2\x80\x9d includes points such as:\nRepeat with me \xe2\x80\x9cYes Mrs\xe2\x80\xa6.,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes Mrs\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d; yes, you are participating in everything; everyone has a qualification, yours is just being an officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\nWomen who are married to or dating men in uniforms have been writing to Mathur Kumar since her first book, Soldier & Spice: An Army Wife\xe2\x80\x99s Life, was published in 2014. One of the more common questions they have these days is about their career. What will I do when he\xe2\x80\x99s posted in a remote location? There are only two answers to this question, Mathur Kumar writes back. \xe2\x80\x9cQuit and work from home or do what so many women do\xe2\x80\x94choose to stay at one station and meet when one or the other gets leave.\xe2\x80\x9d Some educated women are now opting not to marry into the Armed Forces, she says.\nI admire army wives even more than their uniformed spouses. They can pack their tin trunks and move anywhere at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. They can smilingly compare notes about the length of separation from their spouses. One couple I know has lived apart for 11 of their 21 married years.\nArmy wives are expert single parents, managing everything from birthday parties to board exams while their spouses are on deployment in some remote location which may or may not have internet connectivity. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAn army wife always keeps her head high, her voice low and her heart open,\xe2\x80\x9d one spouse tells another in Soldier & Spice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe army wives laugh instead of crying at things that are out of our control.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAll army wives know that one day they may actually be a single-parent household\xe2\x80\x94and that their children might eventually want to follow the same career path as their father once did. Army wives are so sorted, it\xe2\x80\x99s scary. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out a way to fix their petty hierarchies too. \n'

S'The Federal Opposition\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to inject $1 billion into a Northern Australia Tourism Infrastructure Fund if elected will ensure the tourism industry can reach its potential to be the region\xe2\x80\x99s next super-growth sector, the Tourism & Transport Forum said today.\nTTF Chief Executive Margy Osmond said Labor\xe2\x80\x99s announcement today it remains committed to last year\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to establish the fund recognised the critical importance of tourism to Northern Australia\xe2\x80\x99s economic and employment growth.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTourism is the most effective and sustainable way to support Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia as they transition and diversify from a post-mining boom economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms Osmond said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTourism truly is the hope of the side in Northern Australia in terms of job creation and ongoing development.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to supercharge Northern Australia with continued, targeted investment by state and federal governments, and this commitment is a very welcome first step.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs part of this commitment to Northern Australia, TTF would also like to see a focus on Indigenous employment and entrepreneurship through the Concessional Loans Scheme, to boost investment and jobs growth in this critical and iconic part of the world.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernments at all levels cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to supporting the growth of the tourism sector.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s tourism growth in recent years is due to the rise of the middle class in China, but we are at risk of the sector not realising its full potential with successive governments\xe2\x80\x99 unfortunately failing to invest in the tourism infrastructure needed to support its growth. This Fund will make cash available to help address these needs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTourism is particularly crucial to the growth of the Queensland economy, generating $27.7 billion in consumption as well as directly contributing around $11.2 billion to total Gross State Product and employing more than 135,000 people across the state.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTourism is the number one economic issue in Queensland and should be the centrepiece of the upcoming state election.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShadow Tourism Minister Anthony Albanese must be congratulated for his long-standing support of the tourism sector and to growing tourism in Northern Australia.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSource:- TTF\nTags: TTF\n'

S' Kristin Addis from Be My Travel Muse writes our regular column on solo female travel. It\xe2\x80\x99s an important topic I can\xe2\x80\x99t adequately cover, so I brought in an expert to share her advice for other women travelers to help cover the topics important and specific to them! She\xe2\x80\x99s also amazingly knowledgable about traveling around Africa. This month, Kristin breaks down some of the most persistent myths when it comes to traveling Africa.\nWhen I told my friends about my first solo trip to Africa, they thought I was crazy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Ebola?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t travel to Africa alone! It\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to get eaten by a lion or something!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis is a common reaction from those who have not been to the continent and are used to seeing it portrayed in a very negative light in the news and popular culture. We often hear only about the bad side: corruption, war, disease, crime, and poverty. With little else to go on, most people naturally have a negative impression of Africa.\nThe reality is that Africa is a continent with incredibly varied cultures, landscapes, and activities that you can only experience there. Safaris are certainly a big draw, but there\xe2\x80\x99s so much more to Africa than that. Africa is where I saw my first whale shark, where I spent more time staying in the homes of people I\xe2\x80\x99d just met than paying for hostels, and where I safely hitchhiked from beautiful beach town to beautiful beach town. It\xe2\x80\x99s a continent filled with people on the move, a thriving film industry, growing tech centers, and lots of development projects. I am still continuously humbled by the hospitality and uniqueness I find there on every visit.\nYet each time I go back, I hear the same concerns, worries, and misperceptions. Today, let\xe2\x80\x99s address them. Here are seven common myths about traveling in Africa \xe2\x80\x94 and why they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong:\n \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica is just one big place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Africa is often thought of as a single place in the media and pop culture, like when Australia\xe2\x80\x99s shadow foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek referred to Africa as a country. But the continent contains 54 countries, thousands of cultures, an estimated 2,000 languages, and widely divergent landscapes. Africa is home to the largest desert on earth (the Sahara) and the highest free-standing mountain in the world (Kilimanjaro). More than 600 new species have been discovered in Madagascar in just the last decade.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m constantly blown away by how much variety there is in Africa. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sandboarded down giant orange dunes in Namibia, walked along white sand beaches in Tanzania, trekked with gorillas in Uganda, and eaten at BBQ joints in the South African townships (and fancy restaurants just a few miles away).\nTalking about it like one big place is kind of like saying that Europe or Asia is one big place. With Africa, you can\xe2\x80\x99t generalize.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfrica is dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Recent terrorist attacks in Kenya by the extremist group Al-Shabab, the ongoing conflict with Boko Haram in Nigeria, the difficulty establishing a solid government in Somalia, civil war in South Sudan, and the whole Kony 2012 movement hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped Africa\xe2\x80\x99s image. Combined with our cultural memory of \xe2\x80\x9cblood diamonds,\xe2\x80\x9d the Rwandan genocide, and Black Hawk Down, most people\xe2\x80\x99s mental image of Africa is that of a place teeming with conflict and danger at every corner.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true that some \xe2\x80\x94 but certainly not all \xe2\x80\x94 of Africa is very dangerous to travel through at the moment. But this is another instance where you can\xe2\x80\x99t generalize. There are many, many safe parts. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace (which bases its rankings on such factors as violent crime, terrorism, and internal and external conflicts), Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Madagascar, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Malawi (just to name a few on the list) are all safer than the United States.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraveling in Africa is only for voluntourism or safaris.\xe2\x80\x9d\n I remember sitting in a restaurant in Namibia with some locals when one of them asked cheekily, \xe2\x80\x9cSo what are you here to save?\xe2\x80\x9d After all, Africa sees a large number of voluntourists who come to save something and try to do good (though often do the opposite). 47% of Peace Corps volunteers serve in Africa and, in 2014, South Africa alone welcomed 2.2 million volunteers!\nAs for tourism, most people think that in order to see Africa, you have to go on a safari and have everything planned out for you. Very few imagine \xe2\x80\x9cbackpacking\xe2\x80\x9d through Africa as feasible and safe, but just like Asia or South America, Africa has a backpacker\xe2\x80\x99s trail as well, and it\xe2\x80\x99s full of people who are neither volunteers nor safari seekers.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much else to do and see in Africa, like touring the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, lazing away on the famous beaches of Zanzibar, climbing Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, exploring the ancient cities of Marrakech and Timbuktu, scuba diving in Mozambique, exploring the townships in South Africa, and bungee-jumping at Victoria Falls in Zambia, one of the natural wonders of the world.\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou need a lot of money to travel through Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Since most people assume they have to go on a safari, they think it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive to travel in Africa. But Africa doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the land of safaris that cost several thousand dollars per day and beach hotels with private butlers.\nThe opposite is actually true. I was surprised that I could drive myself through Kruger National Park in South Africa or Etosha National Park in Namibia, without paying top dollar for a tour. Between those two parks, you can easily spot \xe2\x80\x9cthe big five\xe2\x80\x9d (the lion, elephant, buffalo, rhinoceros, and leopard) on your own.\nI was impressed by the great value for accommodations as well. In Mozambique, I was able to rent a beach hut for only $15 per night, and you can find budget accommodations ranging from $10 for a dorm room to $20 for a private bungalow (in South Africa, Namibia, and Morocco, as well). I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how unique and funky the accommodations in South Africa were, from campsites to self-contained vacation rentals. In Tanzania, the campsites were usually in beautiful locations, with hot showers and cooking areas and sometimes even swimming pools!\nTransportation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be expensive either. For example, there are budget safari options as low as $80 per day including food, accommodation, and activities (or take yourself on a self-driving safari); Baz Bus (aimed at backpackers in South Africa) offers $10 short rides or a three-week pass for around $325; and car rentals in Namibia and South Africa run around $25 per day for a basic vehicle.\nAfrica doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be super luxury to be enjoyable!\n \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica is dirty and underdeveloped.\xe2\x80\x9d\n As I drove into Rwanda, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how clean everything was, with almost zero trash on the side of the road. I was equally amazed by the sprawling mansions I saw upon entering the capital, Kigali. Since the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s, Rwanda has pulled over one million people out of poverty and maintained peace, as well as involving more women in politics (64% of people in parliament are women) than any other country in the world.\nThis is just one of many countries that are doing well in Africa, including Botswana, which quickly outgrew its ranking as one of the poorest countries after independence from Britain in 1977; it has had one of the highest average economic growth rates in the world (averaging about 9% per year from 1966 to 1999 and 5% since then). The Ivory Coast is also experiencing heavy growth, with a GDP growth of 8.5% in 2016 compared to 1.6% for the United States.\nCell phone ownership is skyrocketing in Africa. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that in Tanzania, in the Serengeti of all places, I still had full 3G service. My coverage was way better out there than I often get in the United States!\nI was similarly blown away by how good the roads were in most of southern Africa and parts of east Africa, including Tanzania and Zambia, for example. There are certainly plenty of roads riddled with potholes or simply made of dirt, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the majority of my experience on the roads there.\nWhile there are many (very many) development problems that need to be solved, the notion that the majority of the countries in Africa are barely developed, poor backwaters is just very far from the currently reality.\n \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica is full of diseases.\xe2\x80\x9d\n The Ebola scare a couple of years ago prompted my friends to worry that heading to South Africa might put me in danger. The reality was that Europe, where I was living at the time, was actually closer geographically to the epidemic than South Africa. (Again, people are geographically challenged when it comes to this continent.)\nMalaria is another big concern; however, there are major initiatives in place to eradicate it. While asking your doctor about preventative measures like malarone or doxycycline is still absolutely advisable, between 2000 and 2015, cases of malaria on the continent have dropped an estimated 88% thanks to an increase of insecticide and mosquito nets. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a 60% drop in mortality! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a chart:\nHIV and AIDS is also a major problem, especially in South Africa and Botswana, where over 19-25% of the population are infected. That said, the rate of infection in the region has fallen by 14% from 2010 to 2015. Elsewhere in Africa, such as in Madagascar, Morocco, and Tunisia, among others, the infection rate is below 0.5% of the population.\n \xe2\x80\x9cTraveling alone there, especially as a woman, is a terrible idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Tell anyone that you plan to travel alone to Africa and you might be met with horrified reactions, due to all of the perceptions listed above. I was admittedly a little bit afraid to travel solo in Mozambique, mostly because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find much information about it that was positive, but I went anyway and came out of the experience with tons of new friends and wonderful memories.\nI have found that solo female travel in Africa is just like anywhere else \xe2\x80\x94 you definitely have to be careful not to walk alone (especially at night), should not get too intoxicated, must remain aware, and need to trust your intuition, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big disadvantage to be solo there. The locals often took me under their wing more, and per usual, I was surprised to find that there were plenty of other solo travelers around, too.\n  ****  \nWhile the media\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the best for Africa, it is, in reality, a wonderful place to travel through, with experiences you can\xe2\x80\x99t have anywhere else. There are still cultures in Africa that maintain their roots, animal encounters that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in other parts of the world, and some of the most beautiful beaches I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\nAfrica is has so much to offer, it has quickly become my favorite continent to travel through, thanks to the friendliness, the warmth, and the adventures. But don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it, go and see for yourself and try not to fall in love.\n'

S'File photo of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association members protesting against the hike in fees in private schools\n HYDERABAD: The issue of hike in school fees seems to take an ugly turn as parents on Friday decided to protest against the delay in submission of a report on this by the Tirupathi Rao committee. \n The panel, which was tasked with working on a formula to regulate school fees, sought an extension of 45 days to submit its report, and that has angered many parents\' associations. \n  The extension was sought by the committee on July 7. The report is supposed to be submitted by August 22. \n Parents have now decided to up their ante against the state government with massive protests in the city. \n "We will soon issue a letter to the committee and the state government over this delay. If we fail to receive a satisfactory response, we shall boycott the report that will be submitted by the committee," said Ashish Naredi, executive member of the Hyderabad School Parents\' Association (HSPA). \n This is not the first time that the committee has sought an extension. The Tirupathi Rao committee was expected to submit its report on May 27, before the commencement of the academic year. While the report was finalised by May 29, the same was not submitted citing legal concerns. \n With further delay caused by the panel, parents are worried that the law to regulate the fee structure in private schools in the city may not be implemented until the next academic year. \n "Initially, the committee members claimed that they wanted to study the Gujarat and Tamil Nadu model of school fee regulation. Later, they reasoned that they were collecting details from all schools. The uncertainty continues as we have no clue as to when the rules will be framed," said Aravinda Jata, member of HSPA. \n It may be recalled here that parents had held a massive protest rally earlier this month against the Telangana government\'s failure in capping the school fee hike in the state of Telangana. \n Over 200 people had gathered in front of the office of the commissioner and director of school education department in Saifabad. \n'

S' Pune: A 28-year-old helicopter mechanic has been arrested for allegedly sending lewd text messages to a 36-year-old makeup artist on her cellphone on June 15, 2016. \n The Bibvewadi police said the suspect, originally from Rajasthan but currently staying in Pashan, was working at an aviation firm in Mumbai. "He also used to offer services to a city-based businessman for maintaining his helicopter," the police said. \n  According to the police, the suspect befriended the complainant on a social networking site in 2014 and got her cellphone number. \n "Initially, he would send her usual good morning messages, but the woman ignored them and eventually blocked his number. The suspect then changed his cellphone number and started sending her lewd messages on WhatsApp. This prompted the woman to file a complaint with the cybercrime cell of the Pune police," the police said. \n The suspect would frequently change his cellphone number. \n "Since he was changing his cellphone number every now and then, the police had a tough time tracing him," a police said. \n Inspector Santosh Barge said of the Bibvewadi police said on Saturday, "The suspect evaded arrest by changing cell numbers and stealing phone of a man in Baramati for sending lewd messages to the woman." \n It was after technical investigations, that we could trace and arrest him, the officer said, adding that further investigations are on. \n'

Every state of the country has something exquisite, which captivates the tourists and gives them an insight of the rich cultural heritage of India. One such state amongst so many is Maharashtra, which has a lot of heritage sites which include the massive Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Elephanta Caves, and Ajanta & Ellora caves. Out of these, Ajanta & Ellora caves which symbolize Buddhism have grabbed the attention of most of the tourists.\nHere's everything you need to know about these majestic caves:-\nAjanta Caves\nFor those who like to travel the past don't need to dream for a time machine; as these caves will infuse you in the history of Buddhist culture with the mesmerizing paintings and sculptures. Consisting of 30 Buddhist Rock-cut cave monuments, these caves depict the Buddhist culture and give you a glimpse of the stories depicted in the form of art and fine sculptures and paintings. These famous works of art also depict the very prominent Jataka tales throwing a light on the childhood memories. Dedicated to the divine God, Lord Buddha, these caves have Chaitya halls or shrines and also Viharas or monasteries, which were used by the Buddhist monks to engross themselves in the peaceful practice of meditation and also to study the teachings of the great Lord Buddha. Even after the desolations of time, these descriptive and stunning sculptures and paintings of Lord Buddha stand in magnificent glory. The caves spread strong positive energy, rejuvenating the tourists and develop a serene environment around them.\nEllora Caves\nComprising of the largest single rock-cut monolithic temple in the world, the Kailash Temple, these caves is one of the largest rock-cut monastery temple caves.

Forming a group of 12 Buddhist (caves 1-12), 17 Hindus (caves 13-29) and 5 Jain (caves 30-34) caves, these caves perfectly explain the love and harmony of the religions in the Bygone era. These cave temples are excavated out of a vertical face of an escarpment and are definitely a delight for the travel and cultural enthusiasts.\nInteresting Facts about the caves\nIt is believed by many that during monsoons, to get a shelter the Buddhists used to spend a considerable amount of time in the Ajanta caves and hence during their leisure time, they exhibited their creativity in different forms of impeccable arts.\nThe second period of the construction of the caves occurred during the Emperor Harishena of the Vakataka Dynasty, during which around 20 cave temples were built resembling the modern monasteries.\nThese caves were adorned with the title of a UNESCO world heritage site in the year of 1983 and really had a great impact on the art culture of India. These caves are the magnificent piece of art in India depicts the serene and calm Buddhist culture in its best form.

S"[Photographs: Chelsea Ross]\nShared plates are a risky endeavor at brunch. Depending on your dining companions' grogginess, you could run the risk of a fork to the wrist if you attempt to share off someone's plate. Choose your comrades carefully when eating brunch at Tavernita, as the shareable tapas format translates to the a.m. with a prix fixe menu ($12.50 per person for four items for the table or $18.50 with a cocktail) of invigorating nibbles and noshes that you almost want to horde for yourself. \nTavernita's brunch menu features four sections: small plates, eggs, on bread, and sweets. Of the small plates, Greg's meatballs are exemplary. Whoever Greg is, he's a meatball Messiah, and he could teach the red sauce Italian joints a thing or two about properly prepared meatballs. Made with Wagyu beef and pork, these golf ball-sized morsels are a hole in one (sorry for that); plump, juicy, and none too dense, immersed in a Nickelodeon-orange hazelnut romesco sauce, with the rich, fatty body of the hazelnuts a perfect foil for the peppery romesco. \nI've never had Frito Pie, but I assume it tastes much like Tavernita's chilaquiles. Thick tortilla chips are cut into curly rectangles and baked with roasted vegetable salsa, Mahon cheese, and scrambled eggs. Unlike some mushier varieties of chilaquiles, these chips stay firm and crispy. I'd prefer an over-easy egg with an oozy yolk to puncture, but the eggs are cooked well, making it easy to build bites and and share with relatively little mess. \nOf the bread items, the artichoke crostini is a standout. The bread has the ideal density and thickness, so it doesn't fall apart when you tear into it. Smeared with chickpea puree, flecked with tangy slivers of artichokes, and adorned with lightly dressed arugula and Pecorino cheese, it may not be remotely brunchy, but I'd happily eat this well-balanced nosh any time of day.\nSweets come with the highest risk of fork stabbing, particularly the custard-tastic French toast. Plates feature one hella thick slice of brioche bathed in vanilla sauce with ginger whipped cream and mango. It's so thick, one might assume the innards are dry and untouched by the French toast better. But nay! This is the creamiest French toast I think I've ever tasted, soaked through with sweet custard and as velvety as pudding in the middle. Granted, it's treacly sweet and you might feel awful afterwards, but it's worth the strife. \nWhen dining at Tavernita, you'd be wise to select a few of your less greedy, more docile friends, so you can have your fair share of brunch bites. Trust me, you'll want your fill.\nTavernita\n151 West Erie Street, Chicago IL 60654 (map) \n312-274-1111 \ntavernita.com/\n"

S"From Monday to Friday, our hectic daily work schedule does not leave us with any time to pay extra attention to our skin and hair. Now, when the weekend comes, there is some extra time in hand and that can definitely be spent on taking care of the beauty requirements of the body.\nBeauty requirements of the body include taking care of both the hair and skin. It is during the weekends that you can try to do all possible skin and hair beauty treatments, such that by Monday you end up looking fabulous and throughout the week, you don't put on a dull look.\nSo that you can use well all the extra time that you get during the weekend in properly taking care of yourself, here is a list of skin and hair care to-dos that you must try to add in your weekend routine. Doing these skin and hair beauty treatments during the weekend will let you look your best during the entire week. So, go ahead and take a look.\nSkin Exfoliation\nSkin exfoliation is not an everyday activity. Yet, you should be regular in exfoliating your skin. Skin exfoliation takes time and during weekdays, you might not invest so much in doing that. During weekends, how about using the time to exfoliate your skin with a gentle scrubber? You can use mild scrubber from the nearest beauty shop or prepare one homemade scrubber to do this.\nSalon Time\nThe hectic weekdays do not allow us to land up in the salon or spend time there. So, how about booking an appointment during the weekend? Some skin and hair pampering at the salon during the weekend will revitalize you for the coming week. In the salon, you can go for treatments and services, depending on the present condition of your skin and hair.\nHair Massage And Masks\nWeekdays are all about those quick hair wash sessions right before going to work. Your hair needs much more than that. So on the weekend, use the extra time in hand for some good hair massage and follow this by applying a good hair mask. This is not only pampering but it makes your hair ready to bear all the dust and pollution, yet not give up during the week.\nMilk Bath\nHow about a special bath during the weekend? Preparing milk bath is really special during weekends if you have all the right ingredients. Along with milk, you will need some honey, rose petal and Epsom salt. Going for a milk bath is rejuvenating for your entire body. Ensure you let your body enjoy and feel the milk all over and do not rush in that process.\nBody Massage or Spa\nThe constant hecatombs of the week make the body tired and fatigued. Get over the pain, with a body spa or body massage. You can schedule your body spa or massage at the salon. These days, professionals also come home to deliver such services right at your doorstep. Doing this prepares you for the coming week and is also very relaxing.\nNail Care\nNow, during the weekend, when you are spending time on the skin and hair, how about spending some time on your nails as well? Men can clean the nails, trim them, file them and also go for some pedicure and manicure sessions. Along with pedicure and manicure, women can plan a good nail colour or nail art that they can carry all along the week. This will also remove existing dirt and dust on your nails, making it feel clean.\nEye Care\nEyes are indeed soft and a special part of the body. Its beauty routine is very different from all your body parts. Eye care, during the weekend, is especially important for those with dark circles or eye bags. While doing this, ensure you use ophthalmologist-verified products alone.\n"

S' Bubbles with salty flavour draw jumbos to the water stream in Mankulam \nTo the surprise of the local people, elephant herds have been arriving from the nearby forests of Malayattoor division and staying for long at a particular location of the water stream at Anakkulam in Mankulam grama panchayat for years now. \nThe river here separates the Malayattoor forest division of Ernakulam district from the Mankulam forest division of Idukki district. The elephants that reach here with their calves drink the water bubbles that keep coming up and stay there till the next day. Old timers too vouch for this practice of elephants drinking the bubbling waters, though they do not swim or bathe in the river. Anakkulam is a favourite spot of visitors for its peaceful presence of the jumbos in groups. In the green ambience of Anakkulam, local people are seen playing football on the riverbank close to the wild elephants. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe animals never move out or come to attack us. We are sure that they are there to savour the water. This is something that we have been seeing for ages now and we don\xe2\x80\x99t bother them and they too do not care about us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sunil, a football player. Close to the elephant hub is a small town with hotels and grocery shops. The wild elephants that come from the forest move back on the same route and there has been no instance of an elephant attack reported at Anakkulam. Local people say that the bubbles in the river bed have a salty flavour making it the favourite of the elephants. Why the water is salty here in an area far away from the sea at an elevation of over 1,450 metres is a mystery. Mankulam Divisional Forest Officer B.N. Nagaraj attributes the phenomenon to the presence of certain minerals underground. \nWater samples from the area had been collected and sent for laboratory testing, but the laboratory did not find any salt content in it, he said and added that the water may be coming out through the cavities of the rocks in the riverbed and the force of its movement through the flowing waters could be easily sensed by the animals. Mr. Nagaraj, who had spent long hours watching the behaviour of elephants at Anakkulam, said that only elephant calves bathe there. The herds would be in a sublime mood when they reach there. They seem least bothered on what happens around them, he says. It is said that one can easily become a wildlife photographer by just clicking the wild herds at Anakkulam. In order to give the visitors a close view of the wild elephants, a watch tower is being constructed at Anakkulam. This, Mr Nagaraj said, would help the visitors to see the elephants up close causing least disturbance to them. The aim is to control tourist inflow into Anakkulam, he said. \n'

S'New Delhi, July 29: A JNU student was allegedly beaten up at the Rajiv Chowk metro station on Saturday by a few CISF personnel and told he would be "sent to Pakistan".\nThe incident prompted the paramilitary force to order a probe even as it rejected the charges.\nIn a Facebook post, Aman Sinha, 22, who is pursuing a Master\'s degree from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the incident occurred on Thursday evening and alleged the involvement of CISF personnel posted at the security check point of the busy station.\nSinha, who was sporting a beard, claimed that the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel got enraged when he "defied" their instructions to take off his earphones, which is a laid down protocol that passengers are expected to follow.\nIt was followed by a heated argument, he said. "Then another CISF person came and said you are spoiling the name of the nation, \'Pakistan bhejenge tum mussalay ko aaj.\'(You Muslim, we will banish you to Pakistan today). They dragged me to the security office through the very long passage where there was no CCTV and no public.\n"They started abusing my mother and sister, thrashing and beating me very badly, saying that \'public k samne humara naam kharab kar diya\'. I tried to record it which they later made me delete and threw away my phone," he alleged.\nWhen contacted, the CISF said the student was only asked to write an apology letter for his behaviour with the security personnel, and was neither "manhandled" nor "thrashed." "He started yelling and arguing with constables Shoeb and PC Bisht who were on duty after he was asked to remove the earphones, which is a normal security drill in the Delhi Metro.\nHe was unwilling and used abusive language after which he was taken to the metro control room," a senior CISF officer said. He added that Sinha was taken to the control room of the station where he tendered an apology in writing.\nA senior CISF official later said an inquiry has been ordered into the entire episode which lasted about 30 minutes and the student was then allowed to go.\n'

S' Last week, we looked at the first part of \'Yes, I Can Dream Again\'. We talked about God dreams - that they are specific to each person, they are bigger than us, and that they can separate us from others. We said that sometimes the circumstances of life can cause us to doubt that our dreams will ever come to pass, but that God who gives the dream, is the One who brings them to pass. And we considered the Israelites who, in 1 Samuel 13, were in a place of despair, ready to settle because of the seemingly overwhelming odds against the dream God had given to them.\n Sometimes, life can throw overwhelming-looking odds at us that cause us to panic and fear we will accomplish our dreams. So, today, we continue the discussion on reclaiming our dreams and look at a few keys to accomplishing these dreams.\n These keys are:\n Overcome Your Paralysis\n 1. To get back on track with your dream, the first thing you will have to do is decide to break your inertia and start moving again. At any cost, you must pick yourself up and decide to start moving again. "One day, Jonathan said to his armour bearer, "Come on, let\'s go over to where the Philistines have their outpost." 1 Samuel 14:1 NLT. To do this, you will have to overcome self-doubt - the voice that gives the list of reasons why you\'re \'not good enough\' - and fear.\n Be in the right company\n 2."Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character." 1 Corinthians 15:33 NIV. Who you are around can have a serious impact on what you do. We have to be mindful of negativity from others. When we listen to this malicious chatter, it prevents us from moving forward and it takes focus off of God. Choose to listen to God\'s voice over the voices of others. You have control over what you allow into your thoughts and mind and what you choose to believe.\n Commit Your Plans to the Lord\n 3. "Let\'s go across to the outpost of those pagans," Jonathan said to his armour bearer. "Perhaps, the Lord will help us, for nothing can hinder the Lord. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few!" If we just stay in that little comfort zone, we don\'t need God\'s supernatural power. We need to step out and chase our dreams and follow after the things of God.\n Refuse to be denied\n 4. We have to press forward with determination irrespective of the odds. How determined are you to hold on to what God has said? "Jonathan said, \'Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. If they say to us, \'Wait there until we come to you,\' we will stay where we are and not go up to them. But if they say, \'Come up to us,\' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands\'."\n 1 Samuel 14:8-10 NLT. We need to be determined. We need to never give up.\n What were the results?\n The Philistines called them up, so "Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armour-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armour-bearer followed and killed behind him. 14 In that first attack, Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some 20 men in an area of about half an acre." 1 Samuel 14:13-14 NLT\n That little victory set in motion a bigger victory. God backs us up when we step forward in him.\n "Then panic struck the whole army - those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties - and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God." 1 Samuel 14:15 NLT\n In short, this account shows us how God used two men to inspire the nation of Israel, which only had two swords and was up against an enemy that was armed with the best artillery of the day. He demonstrated, through the account of Johnathan, that determined faith in God is able to save a nation. What is your dream and what stands in the way of you accomplishing it? I encourage you to step out and watch God work it out. Say to your dream - Yes, I can!\n'

S"Dunkin' Donuts has some Valentine's Day offerings that seem too sweet to resist. We got our hands on each of the seasonal items \xe2\x80\x94 a white chocolate raspberry latte ($3 for a medium), a cookie dough doughnut ($2), and a brownie batter doughnut ($2) \xe2\x80\x94 to see if they taste as good as they sound.\nWhite Chocolate Raspberry Latte\nWe were very excited to try this beverage, especially as it was supposedly topped with Instagram-worthy, heart-shaped sprinkles. Unfortunately, the sprinkles melted on contact with the hot latte foam, leaving only sad pink and red whispers behind. We were overpowered by the sweetness of the drink on first tasting. The white chocolate flavor is delicious, but the artificial raspberry aftertaste is cloying \xe2\x80\x94 and just not an ideal match with Dunkin' Donuts' smooth, light brew. However, we believe that white chocolate raspberry would make an exceptional hot chocolate.\nCookie Dough Doughnut\nUpon cutting this doughnut in half, it appeared that there was not enough filling \xe2\x80\x94 but upon testing it, the real issue is with the dispersal of the cookie dough buttercream. Overall, the filling is balanced by the doughnut, its delicious chocolate icing, and the mini chocolate chip topping, but one fateful bite could lead to the consumption of all the filling at once. Should this happen to you, you will be surprised by how salty the cookie dough buttercream is. Though a challenge, spreading the filling more evenly throughout the doughnut would solve this issue. Additionally, we would have liked to see mini chocolate chips in the filling (like actual cookie dough)!\nBrownie Batter Doughnut\nThis doughnut is truly outstanding thanks to its rich (and plentiful!) chocolate filling. The brownie batter buttercream is basically a darker, gooier version of the icing on top, which is a double win in our minds. The heart-shaped sprinkles were not particularly tasty, but they were so pretty that we didn't care. This doughnut is for a true chocoholic, so be prepared.\n"

Upliftment of SC/ST communities is a constitutional duty for us," he said at the allotment function here.\nAs on date, there are only 6,053 petrol pumps, or 11 per cent of total 54,826 outlets, run by SC/ST against the warranted 12,000 to meet the 20 per cent norm.\nPradhan said in the last three years, his ministry has taken several initiatives to help SC/STs awardees including revision of temporary company-owned-company-operated (COCO) divestment Policy in 2016.\nUnder Corpus Fund Scheme for SC/ST/Women, ready built retail outlets along with working capital loan for full operation cycle will be provided, he said.\nHe said he has written to chief ministers of all states requesting them to make land available to state-owned oil companies at government rate for setting up SC/ST petrol pumps.\n"If land at cheaper rates can be provided for opening hotel and setting up factories there is no reason why our SC/ST brothers should be deprived of this benefit," he said.\nThe allotment letters of temporary COCO outlets to SC, ST & Women beneficiaries was presented in presence of Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot and Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram.\nThe amendment to the scheme of divestment approved last year envisages allotment of temporary COCOs to pending SC, ST Letters of Intent Holders (LoI) and Widows and unmarried women, who are above 40 years of age without earning parents.\nThe amended scheme also provides support to SC, ST dealers, who have lost their retail outlets due to acquisition of land by Government or Government bodies and those SC, ST LoI holders, who have been handed over petrol pumps but couldn\'t retain possession due to court case or litigation.\nPradhan also said his ministry is committed to increase the percentage of SC/ STs in retail outlet dealerships.\n'

S'It would be a huge discovery, but until they train the Hubble on a possible candidate, they won\'t know for sure\xe2\x80\x94so stay tuned\nFor years I have been fascinated by the search for exomoons\xe2\x80\x94that is, moons orbiting planets in other star systems. These worlds are exciting for a whole host of reasons: they could tell us a great deal about the processes that formed our solar system and others, and whether we share a common formation history with the estimated hundreds of billions of planets in the Milky Way. There\'s reason to think moons may play an important role in the habitability of their host planets, as some scientists think our Moon has influenced the evolution of life on Earth. And of course, if moons are habitable in their own right, they stand to expand dramatically the amount of real estate in the Universe where life could arise and flourish. The moons in our Solar System are truly remarkable worlds, astonishingly different from one another, and there\'s every reason to think exomoons could be equally diverse and exotic.\xe2\x80\xa8 \nBut so far, no one in the scientific community has been able to produce an unambiguous detection of an exomoon. It\'s not for lack of trying; there are a handful of us around the world actively seeking these objects, and some have dedicated many years of work to the problem. But exomoons are spectacularly tricky to find. They tend to be much smaller than planets, making their transits\xe2\x80\x94small dips in the intensity of the starlight as they pass in front of the star from our point of view\xe2\x80\x94quite shallow, and "lost in the noise." And every time their host planet transits, the moons show up in a different place, making them particularly difficult to detect. Ingenious indirect methods, like looking for the moons\' gravitational influence on their host planet, are now routinely employed as part of the search. But this work has been computationally demanding and requires exceptionally careful analysis.\xe2\x80\xa8\nEven so, I\'ve long felt that the first genuine detection of an exomoon is right around the corner, and I have been thrilled to participate in this race. It\'s been my great privilege working as a graduate student here at Columbia under my advisor, David Kipping, who has been one of the pioneers in this field.\xe2\x80\xa8\nThis morning David and I put out a paper on the arXiv that represents the culmination of years of work searching for the signature of exomoons in the population of stars examined by the Kepler Mission. After carefully analyzing an ensemble of the highest quality planetary transit signals, we have determined that exomoons appear to be quite rare in the inner regions of star systems (regions of space close to the host star). This finding was both remarkable and, frankly, a bit disappointing.\nWe had hoped and expected to see a significant moon signal in the data, showing us for the first time that moons really are common elsewhere in the galaxy, and that these worlds could be ripe for future observation. Instead we found that the moons we seek are not present in any significant way in the data, meaning that they will remain elusive for the time being, likely hiding in the outer regions of these star systems where Kepler was unable to gather much data. This is a fascinating result on its own, but we had hoped for something else. That\'s the way science goes, though: you have to follow the facts wherever they lead you.\n\xe2\x80\xa8In any case, there was another result in our paper that may make a considerably larger splash, which you may have even read about in the news, or soon will: We announced our identification of a single exomoon candidate, indeed the strongest candidate we\'ve seen in the five year history of the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK) collaboration. The system, Kepler-1625 b, has withstood a host of preliminary tests aimed at ruling out the presence of a moon, and our proposal to observe this system with the Hubble Space Telescope was recently accepted. We are thrilled to get the chance to observe with Hubble, and hope that the observation will confirm our suspicion unambiguously that this is a genuine exomoon detection, which would be the first of its kind.\xe2\x80\xa8\nBut we want to make it very clear what this is, and what it isn\'t. At this point what we have is an exomoon candidate, which is very different from an exomoon detection. While we are optimistic about this candidate, and certainly hope to be credited with the discovery of the exomoon if that is in fact what it is, it remains simply a candidate. Furthermore, we require the follow-up observation on Hubble precisely because we feel the data from Kepler are simply inconclusive. The evidence is tantalizing, but it\'s just not enough to claim a discovery at this point.\nAnd because a discovery of this sort would be a big deal, we have proceeded so far with an abundance of caution, as we have seen so many times how a sensational scientific discovery announced in the media can evaporate under further scrutiny. Let\'s be clear: we\'re not just trying to save ourselves from embarrassment; the announcement and subsequent retraction of potentially ground-breaking results has the effect of eroding public trust in science over time, and we are chiefly concerned with not contributing to that problem.\n\xe2\x80\xa8So why did we put out our paper online now, before a proper peer review and the Hubble observation on which this discovery hinges? Well, it turns out all Hubble observing proposals are publicly available online even before the observation is made, and we found out that at least one media outlet was going to publish the fact that we will be observing our exomoon candidate with Hubble. It remains to be seen how much attention this will get, but we worried that getting the public excited about this object before we really know much of anything for sure is just bad for science. And of course we also worried that it would be very easy for another scientist to come along and try to claim the discovery of this moon using what we feel is really insufficient data. To avoid this, and to be absolutely clear on what we\'ve done and what\'s left to do, we put out our paper in its current form, which is submitted, but not yet accepted, to the Astrophysical Journal.\xe2\x80\xa8\nPeer review is a critical part of the scientific process, and we are not terribly comfortable putting out our results before they have been examined by a qualified referee. Unfortunately, we feel the circumstances have forced us to make our results freely available to the public before such a review, so that everyone may see for themselves what we are claiming and what we are not. While David and I are both big proponents of engaging with the public and boosting interest in the incredible things happening every day in astronomy, we have serious concerns about the potential for sensational headlines misleading the public into thinking a discovery has been made when it is really too early to say that for sure.\xe2\x80\xa8\nThe irony is not lost on me that I\'m writing this blog post saying we don\'t want this to get too much media attention. But I hope I\'ve been able to state our position clearly. And when we\'ve got something real, we\'ll let you know!\n'

S'Photo: Sophia Hsin / Stocksy\nFrom more balanced circadian rhythms to a healthier immune system, owning a dog can have a variety of beneficial effects on your health and well-being.\n1. Circadian rhythms. \nMost dogs thrive on routine, and some literally seem to know exactly what time it is\xe2\x80\x94especially as the minutes tick toward mealtime, when you might find them whining, howling, or pacing anxiously, with a look of concern that you might have forgotten dinner. Many dogs and cats wake up at a fixed time each morning, too, and this is a perfect way to ensure your circadian rhythm\xe2\x80\x94your very own built-in body clock\xe2\x80\x94stays on track, too. A consistent wake-up time helps ensure better sleep, which means pet owners are often more rested (unless of course they\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of puppy training) and therefore, healthier, as a result.\n2. Forced activity. \nDogs need exercise; there\xe2\x80\x99s no two ways about it. Some breeds are considerably more active than others, but even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t need an hourlong run, they all have a need to get outside and do their business and take a walk around the block, at the very least. This forced activity is inherently beneficial for owners; it gets the heart pumping, joints and muscles moving, helps to alleviate aches and pains, exposes us to fresh air, can bring us in contact with drizzle, which is good for the skin and a bit of sun generates much-needed, immunity-enhancing vitamin D, to boot.\n3. Fewer hangovers. \nHaving a pet is a big responsibility. Dogs in particular really don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be left alone for very long stretches of time. This has the side effect of ensuring that would-be very late nights are frequently curbed because of the need to be home with one\xe2\x80\x99s pup. An earlier home time means fewer drinks are drunk, and thus, a hopefully less groggy morning, fewer headaches, and a healthier liver, too.\n4. Being present. \nOne thing dogs are great at is living in the moment and being totally present for everything they do. While some pups can absolutely get distracted by the whiff of food or a squeaky toy, most of them have an incredible ability to totally immerse themselves in whatever they\xe2\x80\x99re doing at any given time. It could be the thrill of the chase in hot pursuit of a squirrel, devouring a meal without glancing up, or simply sitting perfectly still without fidgeting, wriggling, or shifting positions incessantly. Dog owners can learn a thing or two from their canine counterparts and practice mindful stillness, simple gratitude, or complete and utter presence in the things they do.\n5. Enhanced immunity. \nAn overly sanitized home actually creates adverse long-term effects on health. Luckily, dogs have dander and they also carry a plethora of germs. Germs can be a good thing because they help develop more robust immunity. Children who are raised around dogs tend to have stronger immune systems than their dogless friends. Research has shown that infants raised with a dog or cat have fewer coughs and colds and also tend to suffer less with allergies and asthma. One study found that babies who were raised in homes with dogs or cats were 44 percent less likely to suffer from ear infections and 29 percent less likely to be prescribed antibiotics, compared with those who were raised without a pet.\n'

S'Besides the fact that you\'d literally die without it, there are many, MANY imperative reasons to drink water frequently, every single day. It starts out pretty mild \xe2\x80\x94 you might feel thirsty and have a dry mouth. But the long-term effects of not drinking enough water not only have an effect on your weight (in a bad way), but they\'re also extremely dangerous and life-threatening. Here\'s what happens to your body.\nMilder Symptoms\nEven mild dehydration has strong effects. Here\'s how you\'ll feel with a lack of H2O (hint: it\'s really not fun).\nFatigue, tiredness, sleepiness\n Headache\n Constipation\n Dizziness\n Mood change, irritability, increased anxiety\n Sunken eyes\n Shriveled skin\n Muscle cramps\n Joint aches\nSevere Symptoms\nIf things get worse, so do your symptoms. These are the "go to the hospital" signs.\nLow blood pressure, with a rapid heartbeat\n Fever\n Delirium, unconsciousness\n Severe diarrhea and/or vomiting\n Inability to keep fluids down\nLatent Effects\nConsistently not drinking enough water for an extended period of time has its effect as well. Although you may brush off the milder side effects, your body is still suffering \xe2\x80\x94 and several of these have a significant bearing on weight gain.\nLow water, slow metabolism. Your body\'s ability to remove waste and detoxify is inhibited. In addition, your metabolism is slower without water. One study found that drinking 16 ounces of water daily increases your metabolic rate by 30 percent. Guys. That\'s literally ONE standard-size water bottle. JUST DRINK IT.\nIncreased hunger. When you\'re somewhat dehydrated, your body confuses it for hunger, causing you to eat when you don\'t need to. Read: weight gain.\nSlowed circulation, irregular temperature. Your CV system suffers, and your equilibrium is totally out of whack.\nDigestion problems. That constipation we talked about becomes a regular thing. Not fun. Also not great for weight loss.\nGeneral fatigue. Same goes for your energy levels. You\'ll constantly feel tired, unable (or unwilling) to exercise, and unable to concentrate.\nIncreased blood sugar. Your body needs water to break down sugar. If you\'re diabetic, this is especially dangerous.\nSevere Long-Term Effects\nNow for the worst of it. Yes, it\'s terrible that dehydration can make you gain weight (or keep you from losing it), but there are some bigger issues at hand. If you\'re truly neglecting your water intake, this should likely help you get on track. Here\'s what happens to your body when you don\'t get enough water.\nHeat injury\nBrain swelling\nSeizures\nHypovolemic shock\nKidney failure\nComa and death\nNow go get yourself a water bottle and FILL. IT. UP.\n'

S' GAYA: In a crackdown on flesh trade, the Gaya police on Saturday conducted raids in the infamous Sarai locality of the town and sealed several brothels. \n DSP Satish Kumar, who led the raids, said 24 sex workers, brothel operators and clients were nabbed. None of the sex workers appeared to be minor, he said, adding the sex workers would be shifted to shelter homes and the clients would be jailed as per the provisions of the Immoral Trafficking Act and IPC. \n  The identity of the arrested clients could not be ascertained immediately. During one such raid few months back, two Class X examinees of the Bihar School Examination Board were caught from the area. \n According to SDO (sadar) V K Jaiswal, a magistrate has been deputed to supervise the sealing of the brothels. A final report on the number of sealed brothels was yet to reach the SDO. \n Hailing the police action, social activists Ritu Priya and Manoj Kumar said it was for the first time that brothels had been sealed. During earlier raids, the brothels remained untouched facilitating the continuance of the trade and human trafficking, they said. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S'Uh-oh. \nA fortnight ago, a missing Jatin Das painting uncovered what turned out to be an unfortunate and embarrassing art scandal for Air India. Artwork to the tune of Rs 750 crores was found missing from its collection of over 60 years.\nThe missing Jatin Das painting has finally been recovered, but not without setting the ball rolling on another dramatic, potentially embarrassing, scandal. As it turns out, the missing was with a retired Air India Executive Director who \'took\' the painting home from her office on her retirement over 10 years ago and \'forgot\' to return it, reported Times of India. Which has led to a bigger, more awkward question: how many more such high-value artworks that belong to Air India\'s collection are with retired Air India\'s head honchos who have, in a similar manner, \'forgotten\' to return company property, post retirement?\nThe matter of the missing paintings became national news on July 6, when Jatin Das claimed that a painting he\'d made for Air India in 1991 had been stolen and reached the open market, when an art curator contacted him to authenticate his work.\n The director was called in for questioning on July 13 and she confessed to having had the painting, although she claimed it had been gifted to her. \nOn July 10, Air India\'s Delhi headquarters received a courier addressed to the CMD from a fictitious Gurgaon address. The courier held the painting, folded like ordinary paper, but still valuable, despite the damage it has sustained.\nAround the same time, the internal committee set up by Air India to look into the matter of the missing paintings discovered that it was last seen in an executive director\'s office at the Delhi airport. Since her retirement over a decade ago, no one had seen the painting.\nAn airline official told TOI that the director was called in for questioning on July 13 and she confessed to having had the painting, although she claimed it had been gifted to her.\n Air India now faces the unpleasant task of writing letters to its former leadership to return the artworks.  \nThe director\'s revelations enlightened the committee to a unspoken, unrecorded tradition of AI in the past: Chairmen, directors and executive directors have, in the past, routinely \'borrowed\' from the company\'s art treasure to decorate their homes. While it was generally understood that the borrowed art had to be returned to the national carrier\'s collection on retirement, many past top bosses seem not to have done so. Air India now faces the unpleasant task of writing letters to its former leadership to return the artworks. "There will be no action against those who voluntarily return the works," an official told TOI.\nAbout the recovered painting, TOI quoted Das as saying, "It belongs to Air India, I\'m only concerned with the painting as it\'s like a child."\nThe carrier\'s extensive collection, at one time, was 7,000 pieces strong, and boasted of renowned artists such as Jatin Das, MF Husain, Arpana Caur, Anjolie Ela Menon, VS Gaitonde and KA Ara. Unfortunately, at present, only 3,500 of the paintings can be vouched for, between Air India\'s Mumbai headquarters and offices in other cities.\n'

S' North Korea appeared to launch the missile just after 11 p.m. local time. \nThe missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and traveled about 1,000 kilometers. (File Photo)\nStory Highlights\n Test shows North\'s ability to launch \'at any place and time\' \n Test confirmed the missile\'s nuclear detonation control mechanism \n South Korea, US and Japan detected the unusual late-night test \nWashington, United States : North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un said Pyongyang\'s latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile confirmed all the US mainland was within striking range, state media reported Saturday.\n Kim said Friday\'s test demonstrated the North\'s ability to launch "at any place and time," the Korean Central News Agency reported, adding "the leader said proudly the test also confirmed all the US mainland is within our striking range."\n "Dear Leader Kim Jong-Un expressed great satisfaction with the perfectly successful test and praised its developers," KCNA said.\n The report said the test confirmed the missile\'s nuclear detonation control mechanism operated normally and that the warhead could endure the intense heat of re-entering the atmosphere.\n With its second ICBM test this month, North Korea is doubling down on its threat to develop nuclear-strike capability against the US mainland in the face of severe warnings from President Donald Trump.\nThe US leader denounced the launch as a "reckless and dangerous" action and rejected Pyongyang\'s claims that such tests helped ensure its security.\n "By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people," Trump said in a statement. \n "The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region."\n South Korean, US and Japanese monitors all detected the unusual late-night test Friday, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying the missile may have landed within Japan\'s maritime exclusive economic zone.\n "We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile," Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said, adding that the projectile travelled about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) before splashing down in the Sea of Japan.\n However, the Russian military said it appeared to be a "medium-range" ballistic missile.\n The launch came a day after North Korea celebrated what it calls "Victory Day" -- the anniversary of the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Pyongyang regularly times its missile tests to coincide with symbolic dates.\n In Seoul and Tokyo, the governments convened meetings of their national security councils.\n And the US and South Korean militaries began conducting a live-fire exercise using surface-to-surface missiles in response to the latest test, the US army said.\n\'Time for Trump to focus\'\n Joel Wit, a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on the North\'s nuclear weapons programme, said Friday\'s launch confirmed time was running out for Washington to find a way out of a pressing security crisis.\n "Another North Korean test of what appears to be a missile that can reach the United States further emphasises the need for the Trump administration to focus like a laser on this increasingly dangerous situation," Wit said on the institute\'s 38 North website.\n US military and South Korean intelligence officials had in recent days warned that North Korea appeared to be prepping another missile test -- likely of an ICBM.\n The ICBM test on July 4 had triggered global alarm, with experts saying the missile had a theoretical range to reach Alaska.\n Kim Jong-Un, who also personally oversaw that launch on America\'s Independence Day, described it as a gift to the "American bastards."\n It sent tensions soaring in the region, pitting Washington, Tokyo and Seoul against China, Pyongyang\'s last remaining major ally.\n The United States instigated a push at the United Nations for tougher measures against Pyongyang, with Trump saying he was considering a "pretty severe" response.\n Friday\'s launch came just hours after the US Senate passed bipartisan sanctions on Pyongyang.\n North Korea\'s accelerated drive towards a credible nuclear strike capability poses a thorny policy challenge for Trump, who is at loggerheads with Beijing over how to handle Kim Jong-Un\'s regime.\n "It\'s clear Kim Jong-Un remains undeterred by the threat of tightened sanctions, and is not listening to its one major ally, China. The longer the world waits to deal with North Korea, the more advanced Pyongyang\'s arsenal will become," said Jean Lee at the Wilson Center thinktank.\n Trump has repeatedly urged Beijing to rein in its recalcitrant neighbour, but Beijing insists dialogue is the only practical way forward.\n There remain doubts whether the North can miniaturise a nuclear weapon to fit a missile nose cone, or if it has mastered the technology needed for the projectile to survive re-entry into the Earth\'s atmosphere.\n But since Kim came to power there has been a series of technical advances, including three nuclear tests and a string of missile launches.\n France on Friday called on fellow members of the UN Security Council to swiftly adopt "strong and additional sanctions" against Pyongyang.\n\'Frustrating\'\n Reacting to the launch, UN spokesman Farhad Haq said it was "frustrating" that the secretary general\'s calls for all sides to de-escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula had gone unheeded.\n In an apparent reference to China, Haq said it was important for all parties to "use their particular influence to help resolve this."\n In all, six sets of UN sanctions have been imposed on North Korea since it first tested an atomic device in 2006, but two resolutions adopted last year significantly toughened the sanctions regime.\n Meanwhile, the US military is preparing to conduct another test of a missile-intercept system in Alaska, perhaps as soon as Saturday.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n'

S' CHENNAI: With more than 11% of its leisure travellers from India originating from Chennai, South African Tourism kicked off a roadshow and training for travel and tour agents in the city to promote experiential tourism with a focus on tailor-made itinerary options. South Africa aims at attracting around 1 lakh travellers from India this year. \n South African Tourism country manager, India, Hanneli Slabber said leisure tourists and incentive travellers form a good percentage of visitors from Chennai and other parts of India to South Africa. \n  "Most of the visitors are family and individual travellers in their 30s. We are holding the training programme for the travel agents to encourage them to sell experience-based packages for tourists from Chennai," she said. \n The new destinations that will be in focus this year will be Oudtshoorn, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Port Elizabeth and Drakensberg region. These are picturesque areas where travellers can pack in a lot of action in shorter time span. \n The programme will focus on how to roll in six experiences in one day, how to cater to the young traveller, the family market and to make the tours and destinations commercially viable. \n "The young travellers have become more choosey. They do not want to pay for things that they do not use. So hotel tariffs were revised after stripping down the services many of the travellers may not need." \n April to July is the best season to travel. Majority of the travellers from Chennai prefer to travel to Durban while the rest go to Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. \n Slabber said there was a 21% increase in travellers from tier II and tier III cities. "This trend has encouraged us to focus our campaigns on regional languages." \n She said Chennai had been a rapidly growth source market that was driving tourist traffic to South Africa. "We are keen on attracting Chennai\'s travel enthusiasts and the potential is brimming as the city boasts of 6,600 millionaires, four billionaires according to the New World Wealth Report," she added. \n'

S' NEW DELHI: A committee, set up to submit an action plan for restoring Yamuna floodplains, today told the National Green Tribunal that there was no compaction of the soil on the site where the Art of Living\'s (AOL) three-day cultural extravaganza was held last year. \n The report assumes significance as its findings are different to that of an earlier seven-member expert panel which had alleged that the Yamuna floodplains were completely destroyed due to the World Cultural Festival of AOL. \n  The three-member committee, which was formed by NGT after submission of report by the larger panel, today said the land where AOL\'s function was held last year was found to be fully covered with grass and some saplings of tree species. \n "This kind of grass and natural regeneration of seedlings is not possible on compacted soil. The area was also under water in small depressions in majority of the areas where function was held. No significant size of the wetland/water body was noticed by the committee in the area used by AOL," the committee said in its report submitted before a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said. \n Referring to Google earth images, the committee said in its report that it could not locate any "heap of debris" on the site and it is evident that no "wetland or water body" is seen on the site prior to the event. \n "The committee also inspected the areas on eastern bank which are under the control of UP government. This site as informed by chief engineer was used for parking of vehicles on 15 hectare land permitted by them to AOL temporarily for the event. \n "He further informed the committee members that this land was being used by farmers for raising agricultural crops prior to the function and at present also the site is under agricultural crops. \n "The committee observed that no compaction of the soil was seen in this area as many portions were ploughed out where soil was very loose and very healthy crops were standing on the ground. This is only possible if the soil is loose which can support the crop," it said. \n The panel comprises principal commissioner of DDA\'s horticulture department and chief engineers from the irrigation departments of Delhi and UP. \n With regard to the removal of the toxins which may have leached out of the dumped debris on the site, the panel said that two successive monsoons might have already washed away such material. \n "After the function of AOL, one monsoon season of 2016 is already over and monsoon season of 2017 is in progress and it is expected that many of the toxic substances might have already been washed away. Anyway, toxification, if any, identified after the comparison of the testing of the soils of AOL site and the adjoining areas of the river is proposed to be removed through the remediation methods," the panel said. \n The committee has recommended against creation and maintenance of the wetlands within the Yamuna flood plain as such type of activity will also alter the natural flow of the river. \n The matter is fixed for hearing on August 4. \n Earlier, an expert committee had told the tribunal that restoration of Yamuna floodplains, "ravaged" due to a cultural extravaganza organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\'s Art of Living last year, would cost Rs 42.02 crore besides additional ancillary expenses. \n It had suggested that there would be two components of rehabilitation plan -- physical and biological-- and they would cost Rs 28.73 crore and Rs l3.29 crore respectively. \n The seven-member committee had observed that entire floodplain area used for the main event site between DND flyover and the Barapulla drain (on the right bank of river Yamuna) has been completely destroyed, not simply damaged. \n'

S'People tend to use Instagram to share a range of different photos. From those who love the art of expressing themselves through photography, to those who simply want to take selfies, the social media platform is filled with photos and videos of all caliber. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, with the introduction of video and the fall of Vine, people are starting to use Instagram in even more curious ways.\nNevertheless, the same can\xe2\x80\x99t be said for brands. Usually, people expect high quality and artistic photographs from brands that both express their core marketing message and present a visually appealing image. Check any clothing or sports brands, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are coming from.\nOf course, there is some diversity, but most of it comes down to brands sharing different advertisements in the form of photos or the aforementioned artistic takes.\nThe artistic photos strategy is successful for most brands and does manage to work well on Instagram. The core of the platform itself is the visual appeal of imagery. Yet, there are those that manage to stand out from the rest.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we decided to go on the quest to seek something different. Remember the Rick and Morty viral stunt on the social platform from a few years back? For those unaware, the cult animated show Rick and Morty promoted their Instagram account and their show on the platform by taking advantage of the tag feature, resulting in a true point-and-click game.\nInspired by the sheer amount of creativity used by the social media marketers of Rick and Morty to create this game, we set on a course to find some creative uses of Instagram brands have used so far this year. Here are the top 5 most creative Instagram marketing campaigns of 2017 that we\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to find. Granted, they are mostly a long way off from a point-and-click game, but they are nonetheless extremely creative and powerful.\n Samsung #UnboxYourPhone Galaxy S8 Promotion\nWhile not necessarily the longest running Instagram marketing campaign, the #UnboxYourPhone promotional photos of Samsung Mobile were definitely some of the most creative around.\nTaking advantage of the small bezels that are also the selling point of the Samsung Galaxy S8, the company shared creative and unique immersion-inducing photos on their Instagram account earlier this year.\nThe company continues to share such photos of their newest flagship smartphone and alongside the photos of their other devices, the creativity of this marketing campaign definitely shines through.\n Shiseido Product Announcements and Overall Instagram Profile\nA make-up, fragrance and anti-aging products company in Japan, Shiseido has its own creative and unique style of using Instagram. The cosmetics firm takes advantage of the symmetry presented on the feed on the social network and posts three images each time, instead of one, resulting in a wholesome picture.\nWhile not necessarily their most popular marketing campaign, we decided to feature their recent announcement of their White Lucent product on this list, purely because we had to choose one of their numerous amazing photos.\nOf course, scrolling through their account you will be able to see that despite posting regularly they still manage to present something new, unique and different.\n AirBnB #WeAccept Message of Acceptance\nA proper marketing campaign is one which not only represents a brand, but also sends a powerful message people can relate to. With the heavily politicized debate on immigration in the U.S. a lot of companies sent out a message of love, rather than hate via their marketing.\nAirbnb expressed their stance on the issue of acceptance with the #WeAccept campaign. Creative in its own unique manner, the inspirational social media movement by the company started with a video and continued with photos of individuals from different ethnicities and backgrounds.\nEach photo shared a different story and a message of acceptance, while the photos and the campaign itself heavily contrasted the usual picturesque photos shared by the company.\nOf course, getting political on social media is not an easy task for brands. Nevertheless, AirBnB shows just how it can be done right and with a style. This is definitely one of the top five marketing campaigns on the social photo sharing platform done this year.\n #XOXOVictoria by Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nBeing one of the most infamous women\xe2\x80\x99s underwear companies in the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that the Instagram account of Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret is filled with beautiful models in little to no clothing.\n Recommended for You \nDebate on why the account is successful aside, the company did manage to prove that they don\xe2\x80\x99t only rely on sexy, but also on creativity with the #XOXOVictoria photos uploaded in the beginning of the year.\nWhile the #XOXOVicotira marketing campaign doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop with these array of photos, the way the brand has taken advantage of Instagram to create something unique and different is definitely worth taking a note of and it managed to improve the overall audience engagement on the photo sharing platform.\n Adidas \xe2\x80\x98Creative\xe2\x80\x99 #HereToCreate Videos\nWould it be an Instagram list without the mention of Adidas? Running one of the most successful marketing accounts on the platform, Adidas is often the account to check out if you need some creative inspiration.\nWhile their Originals posts are certainly part of an amazingly creative campaign that redefines what\xe2\x80\x99s normal in marketing, we decided to feature their slightly older \xe2\x80\x98Creative\xe2\x80\x99 campaign.\nRunning from February to March in the early spring, the campaign featured prominent athletes from all over the world sharing their passion and love for the sport. Shared with the #HereToCreate trend, the posts were not only a creative take on how an Instagram marketing campaign should be made, but they also took full advantage of the video capabilities of the platform.\n Honorable Mention: Lorna Jane Active\nThe Instagram account of Lorna Jane Active shows how social media marketing should be properly done. In fact, by taking a simple glance at the photos the brand shares through the platform, you will instantly see their target demographic and their marketing message of love, peace, active sports and women power shines through.\nEven though they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have a single powerful marketing campaign that stands out, their social media strategy is simply one to be jealous of. We hope that their photos give you inspiration on just how to describe the essence of the personality of your brand through social media.\n Honorable Mention: The \xe2\x80\x98Salt Bae\xe2\x80\x99 Instagram Chef!\nThe year started with one of the most notable viral successes over on Instagram. A Turkish chef going by the name of Nusret G\xc3\xb6k\xc3\xa7e shared one of the most talked about Instagram videos in the beginning of the year.\nNow, if you want to make a viral video, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you do it! Put a pinch of passion! The video quickly went viral and resulted in one of the most popular hashtags and memes on social media for 2017, known as #SaltBae, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably already heard about it.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s even more notable about Nusret is the fact that after going viral, he continued to establish his Instagram persona by taking advantage of the situation. While not necessarily a planned marketing campaign, this Instagram promotion helped the chef skyrocket his Turkish steakhouse and rumor has it he plans an expansion to the UK now. Thus, it is worth the honorable mention.\n Ottoman steak \nA post shared by Nusr_et#Saltbae (@nusr_et) on Jan 7, 2017 at 2:44am PST\n Express your Creativity Through Social Media Marketing\nOne of the first things every social media marketer should do when coming up with a new social media marketing campaign is to think outside of the box. Each and every social networking platform is bound by a set of rules, but stepping outside of the boundaries of what\xe2\x80\x99s normal can greatly enhance the chances of success of your brand.\nWhile occasions in which your campaign might go viral, such as is the case of our honorable mention Nursret, are quite rare, creative uses of Instagram, such as the case with #XOXOVictoria can boost your audience engagement and powerful messages, such as the one AirBnB shared, definitely go above and beyond pure marketing.\nWe hope that we\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to inspire you at least a little bit with these amazing examples of creative thinking we found on Instagram. Consider the personality of your brand and add a dash of uniqueness next time you post a photo on the platform. We also wish you the best of luck on your next social media campaign.\nWant to get the stats and analytics of your social media marketing campaign on Instagram in an automated, easy to access fashion?

S'Bengaluru: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) would boost entrepreneurship and promote ease of doing business, said Karnataka Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T.B. Jayachandra on Friday.\nAddressing captains of industry at a day-long national conference on IBC organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), the minister said the code would facilitate insolvency of corporates in a timely manner to maximise value of their assets.\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) Chairperson M.S. Sahoo said the code was meant to prevent insolvency, if possible, and allow stakeholders to take a call by providing a market-driven, time-bound mechanism for resolution of insolvency.\n"Wherever the resolution of insolvency is not possible, the code promotes ease of exit as required and provides facilitators for quick resolution. The code also ensures optimum utilisation of resources within a firm or releasing unutilised resources for efficient users for closure of firms," he noted.\nNoting that the code was meant to allow maximum utilisation of resources, Sahoo said the new law would also push the growth rate if under-utilised productive resources were released from less-efficient users.\n"The code provides economic freedom to exit and a mechanism to address failures. It enables an honest firm to come in, get out and realise potential of every person," reiterated Sahoo.\nNational Company Law Tribunal Member Ratakonda Murali, National Council on Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code Chairman Sumant Batra and Assocham Secretary General D.S. Rawat also spoke at the conference.\n'

S'The Rumor: Zapping food in a microwave leaches out key nutrients\nWe\'ve all heard about how microwaving food removes some nutritional value, but is it true? Is something bad happening to our food behind that microwave glass? \nThe Verdict: If you do it right, cooking food in the microwave is one of the best ways to retain your food\'s vitamins and minerals \nThere are dangers to microwaving your food. You could get scalded, for one. If you use the wrong kind of plastic (hint: one that doesn\'t say "microwave safe"), unhealthy chemicals could seep into your food. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about getting the most nutrition out of your eats, microwaving is a safe bet. In fact, it\'s near the top of the list for nutritionally sound food-preparation methods. If you use your microwave with a small amount of water to essentially steam food from the inside, you\xe2\x80\x99ll retain more vitamins and minerals than with almost any other cooking method.\nContinued\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you cook food, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have some loss of nutrients,\xe2\x80\x9d says registered dietician and certified food scientist Catherine Adams Hutt, RD, Ph.D. "The best cooking method for retaining nutrients is one that cooks quickly, exposes food to heat for the smallest amount of time and uses only a minimal amount of liquid."\nGuess what? Microwave cooking does that.\nConsider spinach. Boil it on the stove, and it can lose up to 70 percent of its folic acid. Microwave it with just a little water, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll retain nearly all its folic acid. Cooking bacon on a griddle until it\xe2\x80\x99s crispy (yum) can create nitrosamines, while microwaving bacon creates far fewer of these cancer-promoting chemicals. \nOf course, you can mess microwaving up. Dump your veggies in a bunch of water and overcook them, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll leach out plenty of nutrition. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you cook food in a microwave, cover it tightly, creating an efficient steam environment,\xe2\x80\x9d advises Hutt.\nContinued\nSteaming over a stovetop is just as good, though. In some cases, it may even be better: One small study found that steamed broccoli retained more of its cancer-fighting sulforaphane than microwaved broccoli.\nBut in most cases, using your microwave to cook food, if it\xe2\x80\x99s covered tightly in a microwave-safe container with a minimal amount of liquid, is a nutritional win. In fact, it can even enhance the nutrition of some foods. It makes the carotenoids in tomatoes and carrots more available to our bodies, for example. It makes the biotin in eggs digestible. And heat kills bacteria in food that can make us sick. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom a safety standpoint,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hutt, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be eating raw chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo go ahead and use that microwave. It\xe2\x80\x99s a quick way to essentially steam food from the inside out. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get the aromas that baking or roasting provides, but if you do it right, with just a little bit of water in a tightly-closed microwave-safe container, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very well nourished.\n'

S'Almonds help boost brain development and are essential for healthy and stronger bones.\n NEW DELHI: Nearly 83 per cent of parents feel that consuming almonds -- a natural source of many essential nutrients, including protein and healthy fats -- makes their children remain more energetic throughout the day, a survey shows. \n The survey, led by market research company Ipsos, found that 94 per cent of mothers in both Tier I and II cities, rank "almonds specifically" as the healthiest form of snacking. \n Parents believe that almonds help boost brain development and are essential for healthy and stronger bones in addition to providing a daily dose of energy. \n "A well-timed snack can even out spikes in hunger and provide a much-needed energy boost between meals," Sheela Krishnaswamy, a Bengaluru-based diet and nutrition consultant, said in a statement. \n  "Hence, it is important to ensure we incorporate healthy snacking habits by munching on healthier options like fruits or a handful of nutritious almonds that promote feelings of fullness while also keeping your child energised through the day," she added. \n Further, the survey revealed that a whopping 94 per cent of affluent urban parents in Mumbai choose healthier options of snacks for their children all the time, followed by Delhi (92 per cent), Nagpur (92 per cent) and Coimbatore (87 per cent). \n Across cities, fruits, biscuits and almonds are the three most popular snacking options that parents prefer between meals and when hunger strikes their children. \n "This study indicates a promising trend towards healthy snacking with increasing number of affluent parents in urban centers seeing long-term value in maintaining a healthy family lifestyle," said Ritika Samaddar, a Delhi-based nutritionist. \n The survey interviewed 3,038 affluent urban parents between 23-55 years across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Bhopal and Coimbatore to understand snacking habits among children aged 6-14 years. \n'

S'With regard to the removal of the toxins which may have leached out of the dumped debris on the site, the panel said that two successive monsoons might have already washed away such material.\n NEW DELHI: A committee, set up to submit an action plan for restoring Yamuna floodplains, today told the National Green Tribunal that there was no compaction of the soil on the site where the Art of Living\'s (AOL) three-day cultural extravaganza was held last year. \n The report assumes significance as its findings are different to that of an earlier seven-member expert panel which had alleged that the Yamuna floodplains were completely destroyed due to the World Cultural Festival of AOL. \n The three-member committee, which was formed by NGT after submission of report by the larger panel, today said the land where AOL\'s function was held last year was found to be fully covered with grass and some saplings of tree species. \n "This kind of grass and natural regeneration of seedlings is not possible on compacted soil. The area was also under water in small depressions in majority of the areas where function was held. No significant size of the wetland/water body was noticed by the committee in the area used by AOL," the committee said in its report submitted before a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said. \n Referring to Google earth images, the committee said in its report that it could not locate any "heap of debris" on the site and it is evident that no "wetland or water body" is seen on the site prior to the event. \n "The committee also inspected the areas on eastern bank which are under the control of UP government. This site as informed by chief engineer was used for parking of vehicles on 15 hectare land permitted by them to AOL temporarily for the event. \n "He further informed the committee members that this land was being used by farmers for raising agricultural crops prior to the function and at present also the site is under agricultural crops. \n "The committee observed that no compaction of the soil was seen in this area as many portions were ploughed out where soil was very loose and very healthy crops were standing on the ground. This is only possible if the soil is loose which can support the crop," it said. \n The panel comprises principal commissioner of DDA\'s horticulture department and chief engineers from the irrigation departments of Delhi and UP. \n With regard to the removal of the toxins which may have leached out of the dumped debris on the site, the panel said that two successive monsoons might have already washed away such material. \n "After the function of AOL, one monsoon season of 2016 is already over and monsoon season of 2017 is in progress and it is expected that many of the toxic substances might have already been washed away. Anyway, toxification, if any, identified after the comparison of the testing of the soils of AOL site and the adjoining areas of the river is proposed to be removed through the remediation methods," the panel said. \n The committee has recommended against creation and maintenance of the wetlands within the Yamuna flood plain as such type of activity will also alter the natural flow of the river. \n The matter is fixed for hearing on August 4. \n Earlier, an expert committee had told the tribunal that restoration of Yamuna floodplains, "ravaged" due to a cultural extravaganza organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\'s Art of Living last year, would cost Rs 42.02 crore besides additional ancillary expenses. \n It had suggested that there would be two components of rehabilitation plan -- physical and biological-- and they would cost Rs 28.73 crore and Rs l3.29 crore respectively. \n  The seven-member committee had observed that entire floodplain area used for the main event site between DND flyover and the Barapulla drain (on the right bank of river Yamuna) has been completely destroyed, not simply damaged. \n'

S'India has cautioned against the use of terrorism as a "card" by some nations, underlining that it is an international threat that should not be allowed to serve national strategy.\nIndia\'s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, addressing a General Assembly session on UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, said while nations deal with the threats posed by terrorism, "we must resist the temptation of buying individual peace for ourselves by striking deals that divert terrorists elsewhere."\n"We need to intensify our efforts in persuading states to refrain from using terrorism as a card in the games that nations play. While non-state actors such as terrorists think global, we representatives of States alas, are thinking only nationally," he said yesterday.\nAkbaruddin also warned against the dangers of discrimination among terrorists - "good or bad or yours and mine," emphasising that terrorism is an international threat that should not be allowed to serve national strategy.\n"We need to move beyond discouraging state sponsorship of terrorism and take the next step of building effective inter- state cooperative mechanisms to combat it. If cooperation is to thrive, Inter-Governmental organisations such as the UN need to be strengthened to deal with the substance of these threats," he said.\nAkbaruddin added that the list of the international community\'s collective limitations in dealing with the threats posed by terrorists is too long and self-evident to be recalled in its entirety. "Imagination and integration remain two of our major shortcomings as individual nations and collectively as the United Nations. These have caused much distress at crucial times."\nHe stressed on the need for "honest introspection" to pressing concerns such as from where do the terrorists get their training and financing. "While addressing our limitations, we must do an honest introspection. There are important issues today before the international community that beg answers. Where do potential terrorists go for training? How does their financing work? What are we doing to disrupt the eco-systems that promote terror startups? Do we know the answers and yet choose to look away," he said.\nIndia also voiced concern over the international community\'s reaction to terrorism in some geographies being different from others. "We are currently witnessing the impact of the Middle East on Europe, a development that was waiting to happen and yet not anticipated! In South Asia, we are witnessing the international community\'s efforts of combating terrorism being affected by a fatigue of a long-drawn war in Afghanistan," he added.\nAkbaruddin described nuclear terrorism, radiological terrorism and cyber terrorism as "apocalyptic threats" that have emerged as "ruthless" non-state actors evolve their ideology and adapt strategies to strike deeper roots and explore different avenues to threaten innocent populations of established States.\nHe reiterated the need for an early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, saying it will reflect the unwavering common commitment to cooperate in combating terrorism.\nHe expressed hope that the creation of the Office of Counter Terrorism will encourage an \'all of UN\' approach while addressing the scourge of terrorism. "It is possible that some aspects of this approach may appear overly ambitious given the turf battles common at such fora. However, we must not set ourselves a low bar," he said.\n'

S'Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \nGrenoble: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said Friday.\n Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\n In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\n'

S'THEY were supposed to be the golden couple of the Rio Olympic pool last year but life intervened for world champions Emily Seebohm and Mitch Larkin.\nAussies scorch on day six1:20\nUnbeknown to the public, Seebohm\xe2\x80\x99s Olympic campaign was unravelling for months leading into the Games as her body betrayed her.\nHer menstrual cycle went haywire. She had persistent sugar cravings which caused her to put on weight. She felt such severe back pain during her gym sessions that she thought her spine was going to snap. She had cramps, headaches, constant fatigue that overwhelmed her at times.\nEmily Seebohm returned to the podium at the FINA World Championships in Budapest. Source: Supplied\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in bed almost every day before Rio between (training) sessions, just to let my body recover so I could do a good session that night,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she recalled in Budapest last week.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome days I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get up. I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make my body do it. I was too tired. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t riding my horse, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to pole-dancing, I was doing none of that stuff I love to do and I missed the fun of it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was losing my mind. I would say to Mitch: \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t me. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me? Why am I struggling?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nMeanwhile Larkin was trying to focus on both his own bid for an Olympic medal and his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s plight.\nA month before the Olympics a gynaecologist put a name to Seebohm\xe2\x80\x99s problems: endometriosis.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea what that was at the time,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\nAfter surgery last year Seebohm is enjoying her swimming once again. Source: Getty Images\nEndometriosis is a condition whereby tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other parts of the abdomen, causing pain and inflammation.\nThe next piece of bad news was that the diagnosis could only be confirmed by surgery, and Seebohm could not have that before the Olympics unless she abandoned the Games.\nInstead the operation was scheduled for December and in the meantime Seebohm started researching endometriosis. What she learned scared her.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started reading about it and I recognised these were things that I had all the time and it just clicked that I had a problem,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\nEndometriosis causes fertility issues and that was something that Seebohm had never contemplated before.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that was the hard thing,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt 25 you don\xe2\x80\x99t really think, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a problem having kids or I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a problem later in life. You just think, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have kids like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fine.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the hardest thing because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sacrifice my life for just one thing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nThe other difficulty was that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone outside her inner circle what she was going through. The diagnosis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be completely sure that this was the problem.\nSeebohm leant on the support of partner Mitch Larkin in the dark days in Brazil. Source: News Corp Australia\nShe arrived in Rio as the reigning world champion in the 100m and 200m backstroke but feeling \xe2\x80\x9cflat and down and in a dark hole\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I had done was swim and lie down in my bed and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I did in Rio too.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nUnsurprisingly, she performed well below her best. She finished seventh in the 100m and bowed out in the semi-finals of the 200m before rallying to help the Australian team win a silver medal in the 4 X 100m medley relay. It was widely assumed she had choked under pressure.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that was probably the hardest part (of Rio) because I felt like it was an attack on me as a person and I\xe2\x80\x99m not just a swimmer, I\xe2\x80\x99m a person,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was really hard. I knew I had a reason why I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing what I was supposed to be doing, but instead of making an excuse for it, I wanted to be a tough person (thinking): \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say whatever, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to break me.

I know it did.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nBack to fitness, Seebohm has started thinking about Tokyo and a fourth Olympic Games. Source: AP\nLarkin, who was also a dual world champion, won the silver medal in the 200m and finished fourth in the 100m in Rio, but never hinted at the drama unfolding behind the scenes.\nIt was only when Seebohm underwent surgery just after Christmas last year that she knew for certain that endometriosis had caused her health issues.\nWithin 24 hours of the surgery to remove the excess tissue she had told the world through social media, tweeting from her hospital bed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to make sure that was what it was and then as soon as that happened, I wanted to show people that it was okay to talk about that stuff, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad word,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should talk about it, because one in ten women have it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nShe is now an ambassador for Endometriosis Australia and is keen for others to hear her story and understand what the condition means for women in every walk of life.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kind of thought after the surgery it was going to be a magical cure, I was going to be better, but for a couple of months after I still had some really bad symptoms,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt took a while before I started to feel like myself again and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to deal with for the rest of my life.\nSeebohm is now an ambassador for Endometriosis Australia.

But in a mirror image of their Olympic situation, Larkin has struggled this time. He missed the medals in the 100m and was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 200m after a disrupted preparation.\nThe only upside of that for Seebohm is that she can repay him for the concern he showed her last year by being his \xe2\x80\x9ccheerleader\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 in Budapest.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was my support system in Rio and now it\xe2\x80\x99s my turn to be his support system and I\xe2\x80\x99m totally fine with that,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love him to death so I would do anything for him.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a spectator.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nOutside the pool she and Larkin are going strong, despite the storms they have weathered.\nThey fell for each other after they won matching gold medals at the 2015 world titles in Kazan two years ago and have just bought a house together.

S' Shorter sleep was also linked to reduced levels of HDL cholesterol (Photo: AFP)\nWashington: For a healthy body, you may have to sleep for seven to nine hours daily, as Briton researchers have warned that people who sleep for just six hours a night have a waist measurement that is three cm greater than individuals who get nine hours of sleep.\nAccording to researchers from the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, adults who have poor sleep patterns are more likely to be overweight and obese and have poorer metabolic healthsuch as diabetes-major health challenges facing the NHS.\nThe findings showed that people, who were sleeping an average of six hours a night, had a waist measurement that was three cm greater than individuals who were getting nine hours of sleep a night.\nLead study author Dr Laura Hardie said that not only the team looked at the links between sleep duration, diet and weight, but also other indicators of overall metabolic health such as blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood sugar and thyroid function.\nThey analysed 1,615 adults who reported how long they slept and kept records of food intake.\nThe participants had blood samples taken and their weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure recorded.\n Another researcher Greg Potter said that obesity contributes to the development of many diseases, most notably Type-2 diabetes.\nShorter sleep was also linked to reduced levels of HDL cholesterol in the participants\' blood-another factor that can cause health problems.\nHDL cholesterol is \'good\' cholesterol that helps remove \'bad\' fat from the circulation. In doing so, high HDL cholesterol levels protect against conditions such as heart disease.\nSenior study author Dr Laura Hardie said that because they found that adults who reported sleeping less than their peers were more likely to be overweight or obese, their findings highlight the importance of getting enough sleep.\n"How much sleep we need differs between people, but the current consensus is that seven to nine hours is best for most adults," Hardie added.\nThe results appear in the journal PLOS ONE.\n'

S"Not a fan of the hot stuff? It might be worth getting used to. A ton of new research says it's good for your stomach and may even ward off disease.\nphoto credit: shutterstock\nIt is a long-standing myth that spicy food exacerbates ulcers and other stomach ailments. But research shows hot chili peppers actually protect the stomach lining and may prevent the gastric damage associated with anti-inflammatory painkillers. They are high in nutrients such as calcium plus vitamins A and C, and there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence that hot chilies can reduce cardiovascular disease risk, help prevent diabetes and boost metabolism. They may also have some ability to prevent cancer.\nJust don\xe2\x80\x99t go overboard: A Mexican study found people who ate the equivalent of nine to 25 jalape\xc3\xb1os per day had a slightly raised risk of stomach cancer. (It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too tough for even hot-pepper lovers to stay under that limit!)\nToronto gastroenterologist Dr. Khursheed Jeejeebhoy sees plenty of patients in his office who avoid hot chilies unnecessarily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever people have stomach problems, they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll completely avoid spicy foods in order to heal my stomach.\xe2\x80\x99 There is no evidence they have to do that. Spices in moderation are to be enjoyed, and there is no evidence that spicy food is bad for you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jeejeebhoy, who is an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Toronto.\nShould you turn up the heat?\nIn fact, there is a lot of evidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s very good for you. Recent research tells us that hot chili peppers are an up-and-coming health power. A laboratory study in the United Kingdom, for instance, found that capsaicin, which is responsible for the burning sensation chilies provide, can kill lung and pancreatic cancer cells without harming the surrounding cells. Researchers believe this may explain why people living in Mexico and India, who eat a spicy diet, tend to have lower rates of some cancers than those eating a bland Western diet.\nTwo Australian studies provide more good news: One discovered that adding chilies to meals may protect against the buildup of cholesterol in the blood. Another found that regularly eating hot chilies reduces insulin requirements, which may have implications in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.\nSo what about their effects on the stomach? Hot chilies actually decrease the output of gastric acid, says a Hungarian study. They can also reduce the stomach bleeding associated with taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as Aspirin. A further bonus: A study in Singapore found that eating chilies daily reduced the risk of peptic ulcers by 53 percent.\nHot, hot, hot\nAnd that burning sensation you get from hot food? It\xe2\x80\x99s the capsaicin stimulating your nerve endings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad feeling,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jeejeebhoy, \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that it produces a cut or causes an ulceration or injury of any sort in the gastrointestinal tract.\xe2\x80\x9d The best remedy to the burning sensation is to build up a tolerance, he says.\nAnother huge fan of hot food is Dr. Susan Biali, a Vancouver general practitioner with a degree in dietetics. \xe2\x80\x9cChilies add wonderful flavour and kick to foods, and have very few calories,\xe2\x80\x9d says Biali, who until recently split her time between Vancouver and Los Cabos, Mexico. She has been gradually adding more heat to her diet for years, and jokes that she can even out-chili her Mexican husband, who grew up on spicy food. \xe2\x80\x9cChili is a guilt-free way to make food more flavourful, interesting and exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBiali calls chilies a \xe2\x80\x98no-lose food\xe2\x80\x99 because they boost metabolism, help burn fat and keep us feeling full longer.\n"

S'Losing hope: At least three students have approached the Karnataka Examinations Authority with a request to cancel their seats as they are not able to bear the cost. \nSeveral candidates who obtained government quota seats in many private engineering and pharmacy colleges are stumped by the huge sum of fees they have allegedly been asked to cough up. This amount is in addition to the fees prescribed by the government. The colleges are charging these fees under various subheads including placement fees, lab fees, hostel fees, laboratory fees and so on. \nCiting that this practice is illegal, at least three students who obtained seats in the second round, have approached the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) with a request to cancel their seats as they are not able to bear the cost. \nA student who obtained a seat a top private engineering college in Bengaluru said that he was asked to pay \xe2\x82\xb940,000 over and above the tuition fees he had already paid. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in a position to bear the additional burden of \xe2\x82\xb940,000. I would instead prefer it if my money is refunded so that I could pursue B.Com,\xe2\x80\x9d he said helplessly, while waiting at the KEA office earlier this week. \nThe fees for government quota in private engineering colleges is \xe2\x82\xb950,500 or \xe2\x82\xb956,000 per annum. This has been fixed by the government. The State government refused to yield to the private engineering college managements\xe2\x80\x99 demand for a 10% hike in fees this year. The medical and dental fees however were hiked for the 2017-\xe2\x80\x9918 academic year.\nPharmacy colleges \nBesides engineering colleges, pharmacy colleges offering B-Pharma and Pharma-D courses are in fact charging excess fees of up to \xe2\x82\xb91.5 lakh. The fees fixed by the government is \xe2\x82\xb921,430 for government quota seats in private pharmacy colleges. \nThe Admission Overseeing Committee, headed by Justice Anand Byrareddy, has received around three complaints for charging excess fees from engineering and pharmacy colleges. \xe2\x80\x9cMost students are glad that they have obtained the seat and do not want to confront the management for these illegal practices. Therefore, only a few of them come and lodge complaints with the committee,\xe2\x80\x9d a source in KEA said. \n\xe2\x80\x98No choice\xe2\x80\x99\nA management representative of an engineering college claimed that colleges have no option but to charge excess as the fee fixed by the government was not enough to meet requirements. \xe2\x80\x9cOur expenditure is not enough to meet the infrastructural and faculty requirements. So, we have no option but to charge fees for all this to meet our costs,\xe2\x80\x9d a management representative said. \n'

S'The i5 \xe2\x80\x93 or, rather, iNext \xe2\x80\x93 isn\'t dead.\nBMW\'s upcoming electric crossover \xe2\x80\x93 whether it\'s called the i5, iNext, or something else \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x93 will feature level 3 autonomous driving capabilities, InsideEVs reports.\nSAE defines level 3 autonomy as a "conditional automation," a mode-specific system where the car takes over all driving functions, with the human required to be ready to intervene. This means the human driver can take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, but will be alerted to take over if the car decides it can\'t perform the functions on its own under the current conditions. BMWi\'s national manager in Canada, Kevin Marcotte, told InsideEVs, the electric crossover will be "a major leap forward not only in terms of electrification, but also in technology. It will be the next big thing for us in terms of leapfrogging the industry."\n Also interesting about this news from InsideEVs is that it appears to confirm one rumor, and put another to rest. BMW has long been rumored to be working on an electric crossover, called the i5, until another rumor claimed the project had been killed off. BMW recently announced, though, that it would simplify its lineup to focus on electrics, and apparently an electric sport activity vehicle/crossover is still in the works. BMW is still working with the (not finalized) name iNext, borrowed from the Vision Next 100 concept, seen above.\n BMW also said the iNext will get a number of new technologies, without naming them. InsideEVs reports that BMW reconfirmed its 2021 release date for the iNext, and that we\'ll get an i8 roadster next year, a Mini BEV in 2019, and an all-electric XBMW X3 in 2020.\n'

S'Executive Summary\nOne of the most common ways companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results. New research illuminates how diversity training effectiveness can depend on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes. Experiments conducted with college students reveal two promising options: perspective taking (walking a mile in someone\xe2\x80\x99s shoes) and goal setting (for example, setting a goal to speak out the next time you hear someone make a biased comment).\nOne of the most common ways that companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results: Some studies show that diversity training is effective, others show it\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective, and still others show that it may actually lead to backlash. This has led to pessimism regarding diversity training, with some claiming it simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nWe believe that pessimism is premature. For one, a recent meta-analysis of over 40 years of diversity training evaluations showed that diversity training can work, especially when it targets awareness and skill development and occurs over a significant period of time. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there\xe2\x80\x99s a single perfect solution to creating diverse and inclusive organizations. Diversity training effectiveness depends on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes.\nOur research highlights how changing a few aspects of diversity training might actually make a difference, depending on how they\xe2\x80\x99re applied within organizations. While our work takes the form of small-scale experiments with undergraduate students, we believe it has potential to be used smartly inside companies. And since undergraduate students are undoubtedly future employees, we view uncovering what works for this group as a first step in discovering what might work for the broader population of working adults. Additionally, using a population of students affords us a greater degree of experimental control (by incorporating a control condition where no diversity training is received for comparison purposes, comparing the effects of specific training exercises with one another, and measuring multiple outcomes over time), which allows us to uncover truths regarding diversity training effectiveness in a way that may not be as feasible in businesses or other organizations.\nOne training exercise that we analyzed, and that shows promise, is perspective-taking, which is essentially the process of mentally walking in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. Results from our experiment involving 118 undergraduate students showed that taking the perspective of LGBT individuals or racial minorities \xe2\x80\x94 by writing a few sentences imagining the distinct challenges a marginalized minority might face \xe2\x80\x94 can improve pro-diversity attitudes and behavioral intentions toward these groups. These effects persisted even when outcomes were measured eight months after training. Even more exciting is the fact that perspective-taking was shown to be capable of producing crossover effects. In our experiment, taking the perspective of LBGT individuals was shown to be associated with more positive attitudes and behaviors toward racial minorities, and vice versa.\nAnother activity that has empirical support is goal setting. Recent evidence shows that this strategy \xe2\x80\x94 more broadly used to motivate improved aspects of someone\xe2\x80\x99s job performance \xe2\x80\x94 can be successfully adapted by asking diversity training participants to set specific, measurable, and challenging (yet attainable) goals related to diversity in the workplace. For example, a trainee might set a goal to challenge inappropriate comments about marginalized groups when overhearing them in the future (in combination with receiving information about how best to handle such situations). Our experiment with 158 undergraduate students showed that goal setting within diversity training led to more pro-diversity behaviors three months after training and improved pro-diversity attitudes nine months after training. These long-lasting effects are notable, given that diversity training sessions in organizations are usually few and far between.\nBoth of these exercises (perspective-taking and goal setting) produced effects on behavioral outcomes, such as displaying more support and engaging in less mistreatment toward marginalized minorities. These are arguably the most important outcomes, but are often neglected in diversity training research in favor of attitudinal outcomes (the prejudice and bias that one feels toward marginalized groups) and cognitive outcomes (how well-informed someone is regarding stereotypes and biases against marginalized groups).\nOur work also shows that personality characteristics may influence the effectiveness of training, making particular strategies more effective for some employees and less effective for others. For example, perspective-taking may be more effective for individuals who lack empathy than for those who are highly empathetic. We think this is the case because individuals who are high in empathy may be more likely to engage in spontaneous perspective-taking on their own, whereas individuals who are low on this characteristic may need a diversity training activity as a prompt. Similarly, our work (which we presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) has shown that individuals who are high on social dominance orientation \xe2\x80\x94 the degree to which an individual prefers majority groups dominating minorities within a social hierarchy \xe2\x80\x94 tend to be more resistant to diversity training than individuals who are low on this trait. However, there is hope: Having an authority figure endorse the importance of diversity initiatives can enhance the effect of training for these individuals, in effect providing a means to appeal to and reach potentially resistant trainees.\nSo, as you design or tweak your company\xe2\x80\x99s diversity training program, keep these findings in mind. A blanket program will likely be a waste of your time \xe2\x80\x94 and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 time. But by tailoring empirically supported exercises and activities to your goals and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 characteristics, you can make progress in making your organization more welcoming and inclusive.\n'

That equates to 2566 more cars.\nFor the month, new and used car registrations were up 11 per cent. \nIt was the 11th month in a row that the value of imported cars increased compared to the year before.\nMieke Welvaert, an economist at Infometrics, said population growth was a big driver of the increase.\n"We think population growth directly drove 34,000 car sales over the March 2017. It\'s the same as for houses. There are more people arriving int the coungtry when they arrive, they buy all the set-up things - houses and cars."\nShe said the number of cars owned by each household was also increasing. "We calculate that in March 2017, there were 1.58 cars per household in New Zealand, the highest rate since our records began in June 1991."\nWhile the economy was doing well and people were more secure in their employment, they were more likely to upgrade their cars, she said. \nThe growth in sales was strongest in cars with smaller engine sizes.\nDavid Crawford, chief executive of the Motor Industry Association, said cheap finance, thanks to low interest rates, was also a factor. "People aren\'t buying cars on the mortgage any more. It used to be the cheapest way but now people just take the finance rates at the dealer."\nElectric vehicles\' sales increased 184 per cent over the year to June. There are now just under 4000 in the country. \nNew Zealanders now get better value for money from their vehicles. In 2007, a buyer would have paid $31,345 for a new Mazda 3, or $34,466 when adjusted for inflation. Now, despite 10 years\' worth of technological developments, the 2017 models sell for $32,795. \nA Toyota Corolla was $31,650 in 2007, or $34,802, inflation-adjusted. Today they sell for $31,690.\nStandards for used cars have lifted and Welvaert said, while New Zealand had lower emissions rules than in Australia, Britain and Europe, local consumers benefited from higher expectationss internationally.\n"As a result of what they buy we tend to get a similar composition because we are a smaller market by comparison. We get better, more fuel efficient cars as a result of what everyone else decides they want."\nThere was significant price pressure in the market, she said.\n"Prices are really low - prices for new cars have consistently gone down."\nCrawford said the strong New Zealand dollar made cars more affordable. "There\'s strong competition between manufacturers for the price of vehicles."\nHe said people were increasingly getter better quality cars for the same money. "Each new model is a bit better safety-wise than previous models."\nBut he said the standards for used cars still needed improvement. All new cars must have electric stability control but there is only a rolling programme to require it of used cars. \n'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): Outgoing Pakistan High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit on Saturday emphasised on a continuous dialogue between the two nations for resolving disputes.\n"Engagement is imperative to both countries. Both the countries had decided that they would separate talks from terrorism, because there would be forces in both nations, which cannot accept the normalisation of any relationship," he said at an event here.\nHe said that there should be a dialogue in place to address the perceptions or misconceptions on each side.\nFurther talking about Pakistan\'s support to Kashmiris, he said, "Perceptions and misconceptions in India about Pakistan\'s support to the people of Jammu and Kashmir are not limited to moral, diplomatic or political support. They are beyond that."\n"The people of Jammu and Kashmir should not be allowed to suffer because of what Pakistan or India did or did not do. Kashmiris have the right to self determination as was committed to them by both countries ," he added.\nHis comments come a day after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti talked about the state in a seminar where she discussed issues like Article 35-A under Article 370, which gives special status to the state.\nThe outgoing envoy said that Pakistan does not shy away from discussing issues like terrorism as the country too has concerns when it comes to this.\n"Once we start talking to each other there would be other issues like terrorism. So, engagement is the key and we should not take it as a favour from one country to another. It\'s a prerequisite; it\'s a necessity if we are to resolve our problems," he said.\nThe India-Pakistan relations have been strained ever since a death sentence was awarded to former Indian Naval officer Jadhav. India even moved the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to seek justice for Jadhav that stayed the death sentence till its final decision.\nWhen asked about the future of the downhill relations, the outgoing envoy said, "Never give up. Keep trying; things will get better."\nThe Pakistan government had earlier accepted the request of Abdul Basit to resign from the foreign service after he was passed over for the post of foreign secretary earlier this year.\nBasit was to retire in April 2018, but he opted for an early retirement and sent his resignation letter to former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

The Haryana Gau Sewa Aayog, an autonomous body constituted by the state government in 2013, will soon send its proposal of setting up \xe2\x80\x9ccow hostels\xe2\x80\x9d across the state to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.\nAayog chairman Bhani Ram Mangla told The Sunday Express that he has discussed the proposal with state Urban Local Bodies Minister Kavita Jain, who, he said, wanted the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst such cow hostel to come up in Sonipat, her assembly constituency\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe Aayog, which plans to seek land from Urban Local Bodies Department to construct these cow sheds or \xe2\x80\x9ccow hostels\xe2\x80\x9d, wants to first run a pilot \xe2\x80\x93 start such hostels in one or two towns \xe2\x80\x93 before replicating the same in the other parts of the state \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping in view the response to such hostels\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe plan is to keep about 50 cows in each hostel, Mangla said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will allow admission only to indigenous cows; not cross-bred ones\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all goes well, we will set up societies for the management of each cow hostel. These societies will work like Resident Welfare Associations,\xe2\x80\x9d Mangla said, adding that the Urban Local Bodies Department would have ownership over the land and the societies would pay rent to the department.\nWhile the societies will charge an \xe2\x80\x9caccommodation fee\xe2\x80\x9d, the cow owners \xe2\x80\x9cwill be able to use the milk for their domestic purposes. They will also be free to sell the milk\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe Aayog hopes the cow hostels will ensure protection of cows while helping to control the number of stray cattle on the roads. According to the Livestock Census of 2012, there are 1.48 lakh stray cows on the roads. However, Mangla claims the number of such cows has come down to 25,000. Currently, the state has 437 gaushalas to accommodate 3.2 lakh cows.\n'

S' A striking panorama by NASA\'s Mars rover Opportunity shows a crater-rim notch that may have been carved by liquid water long ago.\n The photo is a mosaic of multiple images taken from June 7 through June 19 \xe2\x80\x94 a time during which the 13-year-old rover was stationary as engineers tried to fix its balky left-front wheel, which was stuck pointing outward more than 30 degrees. As a result, Opportunity team members dubbed the image the "Sprained Ankle" panorama," NASA officials said.\n The mosaic depicts a portion of the rim of 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater, which Opportunity has been exploring since August 2011. The notch may be an ancient spillway for water headed down into the aptly named Perseverance Valley below, NASA officials said. But ice or wind may also have created the feature, they added. [13 Years on Mars! NASA Opportunity Rover Still Rolling (Video)]\n "It is a tantalizing scene," Opportunity deputy principal investigator Ray Arvidson, of Washington University in St. Louis, said in a statement. "You can see what appear to be channels lined by boulders, and the putative spillway at the top of Perseverance Valley. We have not ruled out any of the possibilities of water, ice or wind being responsible."\nThis July 7, 2017, photo from the navigation camera on NASA\'s Opportunity Mars rover shows a view from the upper end of "Perseverance Valley" on the inner slope of Endeavour Crater\'s rim. At left, the valley descends about 200 yards to the crater floor. In the middle, the crater rim extends southeastward.\n Mission team members diagnosed the wheel issue as a stall in the left-front actuator. They managed to straighten out the wheel and get Opportunity driving again, though they\'re currently steering the six-wheeled rover using only the rear-wheel actuators, NASA officials said. (The right-front actuator hasn\'t worked since 2006.)\nThis July 18, 2017, image from the navigation camera on the mast of NASA\'s Mars rover Opportunity shows the crest of Endeavour Crater\'s rim after the rover began descending "Perseverance Valley" on the rim\'s inner slope.\n Opportunity has since descended into Perseverance Valley, where it\'s waiting out a command moratorium imposed by celestial geometry: The sun is currently between Mars and Earth, disrupting communications between mission control and the rover. NASA stopped sending commands to its three active Red Planet orbiters and two rovers on Saturday (July 22) and won\'t resume commanding until Aug. 1, agency officials said.\n The golf-cart-size Opportunity touched down in January 2004, a few weeks after its twin, Spirit. Both rovers embarked on three-month missions to hunt for signs of long-ago liquid water. Both found plenty of such evidence, then kept on rolling; Spirit wasn\'t declared dead until 2011, and Opportunity is still going strong (though it is showing signs of age, as the actuator issues and an arthritic robotic arm attest).\n In case you can\'t get enough of the Sprained Ankle panorama, here it is in enhanced color:\nThis June 2017 view from the Pancam on NASA\'s Opportunity Mars rover shows the area just above "Perseverance Valley" on the western rim of Endeavour Crater. Color has been enhanced to make differences in surface materials easier to see.\n And here it is in 3D:\nThis June 2017 stereo view from NASA\'s Opportunity Mars rover shows the area just above "Perseverance Valley" on the rim of a crater. It combines images from the left eye and right eye of the rover\'s Pancam to appear 3D when seen through blue-red glasses, with the red lens on the left.\n'

S' Congress MLA and son of former Gujarat chief minister Mahendrasinh Vaghela on Saturday condemned the grand old party?s decision to shift the party MLAs to another city and said the party decision indicates that it doesn?t trust its own leaders. \n?The Congress is on the backfoot in the state. What was the need to take all the MLAs to Bengaluru? This act simply means that the party?s high command doesn?t trust their own MLAs,? Mahendrasinh said. \nTalking to ANI, Mahendrasinh neither disclosed if he will also resign from the party like his father, nor did he reveal the number of the MLAs, who are expected to resign from the party in the coming days. \n?For the past one year he (Shankersinh Vaghela) was suggesting some reforms to the Congress high command, which was apparently necessary to implement for the party to come back to power in the state. His suggestions were not taken seriously. As a result, he got upset and resigned from the party,? he added. \nMahendrasinh also asserted that there is a lack of leadership in the Congress and things don?t work as per the requirement. \n?The Antony Committee had said that the party should declare their candidate a year before the date of elections and there were other things also suggested by the committee. It was decided that the party will work according to that committee. But nothing happened,? he said. \nIn the backdrop of Gujarat Congress MLAs quitting and joining the BJP, as many as 44 of the grand old party MLAs left for Bengaluru late last night to ensure they don\'t succumb to police and political pressure to join the saffron party. \nSpeaking to the reporters, Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar said, "To ensure that BJP is not successful in its mission, 44 of us Congress MLAs are leaving from Gujarat for Bengaluru. To hide their failure, the saffron party is trying to make sure our MLAs resign by offering money and through police pressure." \nCongress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi had accused the BJP in the state of horse-trading ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections scheduled for August 8. \nFollowing this, Union Minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad laughed off the accusation and said the Congress has become a sinking ship and is not able to hold their own house together. \nThe developments came after at least six Congress MLAs in Gujarat resigned from the party to join the BJP.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'Australian counter-terrorism police were conducting raids across several Sydney suburbs late on Saturday. \nAustralian Federal Police (AFP) said the "operational activity" by the Sydney Joint Counter Terrorism Team "relates to an ongoing investigation." \n"The safety of the community and police members are the primary consideration during this activity," the AFP said in a press release, declining to provide further information as the raids were still in progress. \nThe raids were being carried out in four suburbs in different parts of the city, police said. \nAustralia, a staunch ally of the United States, has been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters, since 2014. \nAuthorities say they have thwarted a number of potential attacks since then, but there have been several "lone wolf" assaults, including a cafe siege in Sydney that left two hostages and the gunman dead. \nAbout 100 people have left Australia for Syria to fight alongside organizations such as Islamic State, Australia\'s Immigration Minister said last month. \nAustralian newspaper publisher News Ltd reported up to 40 riot squad officers were seen swooping on a house in the inner city suburb of Surry Hills.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - Widespread flooding in India\'s western industrial state of Gujarat has killed more than 120 people and paralyzed infrastructure, officials said on Friday, with tens of thousands of cotton farmers also suffering heavy damage. \nTorrential monsoon rain and flooding in recent weeks have killed at least 300 people in western and eastern states, an official in the National Disaster Management Authority told Reuters in New Delhi. \n"Our teams are working in different parts of India with soldiers to ease the situation," said Deepak Ghai, an emergency room control officer. \nMore than a million households had been affected and losses to farmlands were being assessed. \nThe airport in Ahmedabad, the main commercial hub of Gujarat, was partially flooded, forcing airlines to divert flights. More than 150 factories were forced to shut down, said A.R. Raval, a district administrator. \n People carry packets of snacks after receiving them from civil defence volunteers in a flooded neighbourhood after heavy rains in Ahmedabad. Amit Dave \nThe floods have come at a particularly bad time for cotton farmers in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s home state. \nRaval said more than 50,000 were struggling to drain water from their land and homes. \nRecent downpours have hit cotton and millet in Gujarat and Rajasthan, where farm experts now fear pest infestations. \n"Cotton and millet harvests are expected to suffer in about three districts each in Gujarat and Rajasthan, but the biggest worry is that the extra moisture could lead to pest attacks in these areas," Devinder Sharma, an independent farm expert, said. \nRains have been 4 percent above average since the four-month monsoon season began in June, according to the state-run India Meteorological Department. \nAdditional reporting by Mayank Bhardwaj Writing by Rupam Jain\n'

S'The outgoing president of India used an interesting word to describe the soul of India. He said it resides in \xe2\x80\x98pluralism\xe2\x80\x99. Yet during his presidency he defended \xe2\x80\x98secularism\xe2\x80\x99 an ideology that promotes tolerance but not pluralism. What and when the president said is the tragic contradiction of India, a State whose institutional ideology supresses its soul while people try and find expression for that soul.\nThe Indian civilisation is indeed uniquely a pluralist civilisation. It does not aspire to simply tolerate but permits alternative ideas and ideologies to flourish as equal.\nSecularism on the other hand merely tolerates. It permits alternative ideologies to survive in the personal domain as personal religion or belief. Those competing in the public domain have to commit to pretending that apart from democracy and atheist political ideas, all others are irrelevant to the system of governance.\nIn India however, these non secular ideas have been part of the plural public domain for more than thousand years until the British introduced European monopolistic public domain as a the ideology of governance.\nNot only the ex-President, but there are a number of politicians and thinkers who think that there is a dysfunctional relationship between the what Mukherjee calls \xe2\x80\x98soul\xe2\x80\x99 of India and the constitutional India that the State of India inherited from British liberalism.\nBut why say it at the end of the presidency. India\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, Shri Krishna Kant in 1999 also said something similar. In fact he even dared to say that the concept of dharam and Indian civilisation had been distorted by western secularism. He, like Pranab Mukherjee, said that India\xe2\x80\x99s essence is pluralism. Yet in office these powerful politicians defended a constitution and an ideology that they clearly knew does not reflect the \xe2\x80\x99soul\xe2\x80\x99 of India let alone give it expression. If they know this, why not initiate change when in office instead of making throw away statements at inconsequential times.\nBoth with majoritarian democracy lifted from Westminster and secularism taken as crumbs from European intellectual tables, India has carried on with the British created and then discarded body of the Indian State on life support, keeping it going under indigenous management. Is it any wonder that poverty continues, communalism flourishes and corruption reigns. While the soul of Indians as a people may be based on pluralism, the State\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual home is in Europe where secularism emerged as another of the big Abrahamic ideologies.\nIt must be time that Indians start some introspection. Surely in 5000 years of history, the only contribution of India to world civilisation cant just be a curry and a sari to which now PM Modi has added Yoga. There must be Indian political ideologies and Indian forms of consensus that are more sophisticated than the simple majoritarian democracy borrowed from Westminster. There must be Indian political philosophies that reflect the plural soul of India.\nMukherjee\xe2\x80\x99s statement had some sad undertones in some ways. It appeared that the statement was acknowledging that in office he was flogging something that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite believe in. Perhaps he was also making a veiled reference to the Hindutva agenda but he would be missing that essence of \xe2\x80\x98soul of India\xe2\x80\x99 if he thought that secularism was it. One can only assume that as President and an intellectual, he would appreciate the difference between secularism and pluralism and was in fact referring to this difference.\nThere are no longer the British to stop Indians developing a pluralistic political institution in India and adopt a pluralistic constitution. So why after 70 years, India carries on as if it is still seeking approval and a nod from its previous masters that it is doing well with the \xe2\x80\x98Indian project\xe2\x80\x99. Why carry on with the institutions created by Britain to impose their own culture upon Indians?\nIsnt it time, that India can breathe easily and start a slow process of giving expression to this supressed soul? Why still seek words of \xe2\x80\x98well done boys\xe2\x80\x99 from the British by boasting that \xe2\x80\x98India is the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest democracy\xe2\x80\x99. This only adds to the British self smugness and pride that it was they who have taught this 5000 year old civilisation how to govern!\nWhy go on being proud telling the world that the Indian judicial system is the same as in Britain with separation of executive and judiciary. So what happened in the 5000 minus colonial period. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there anything of worth in Indian justice from that long period or was it a period of long darkness waiting for British colonialists to drag Indians into some form of enlightenment?\nThe truth is that many an Indian realises they are supporting and bandaging an artifice, a plastic scaffolding of governance which does not have a soul originating from the long history of India\xe2\x80\x99s plural civilisations. Yet no one has the courage to say it in public let alone shake the system. Many say it in coded language as the ex president has said.\nPerhaps it is time that India lifted the veil of self deceit. Instead of being the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest democracy with the most number of people in poverty, it may be an idea to have an Indian form of consensus politics and very little poverty. Instead of being a country that plays the parliamentary game as handed down by the colonialists, perhaps India can create a house of representatives that truly represent its diversity.\nPerhaps what Mukherjee should also have said is, there fore we need to drop the word secular in the constitution and replace it with the word \xe2\x80\x98plural\xe2\x80\x99. That may be a start.\n'

S'Aircraft debris, which could be from one of two Air India crashes which occured in 1950 and 1966, on the Mont Blanc massif, French Alps. (AFP Photo)\n GRENOBLE (France): Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in either of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps. One of them had Homi Bhabha, the father of the Indian nuclear programme, on board. \n  Daniel Roche, a climber who is fascinated by plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier in the Alps looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday. "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time, however, he found a hand and the upper part of a leg. \n  Two major accidents have taken place at the site with over 150 people killed in total. On January 24, 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. \n   French rescuers beside a helicopter, working at the site where the remains were found. (AFP Photo) \n Bhabha, a physicist and chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, was travelling to Vienna for a conference. \n The circumstances of his death were seen as mysterious and caused speculation since he had spearheaded the establishment of India\'s first atomic energy facility at Trombay, giving it a strategic advantage. \n The aircraft named Kanchenjunga had made two designated stops, at Delhi and Beirut, and was due for a third in Geneva. \n The pilot was instructed to descend for Geneva\'s Cointrin airport upon passing Mont Blanc. \n It was believed an apparent defect in radio navigation made the captain wrongly assume that he had passed over the mountain; he began his descent and in a snow storm flew straight into the Mont Blanc massif. \n Another AI flight, a Lockheed Constellation named \'Malabar Princess\' had crashed on the mountain in November 1950, killing 48 people. Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he has also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \n On learning about frozen human remains being found, aviation secretary R N Choubey asked AI chairman Ashwani Lohani to rush to the spot the station manager closest to the site of discovery. "This AI official will get in touch with local investigators and the Indian embassy. We\'ll take the steps required," Choubey told TOI. \n Lohani said he has asked officials to find out more. "We are trying to get details from Paris," Lohani told TOI. \n AI flies to a number of destinations in Europe, including Paris. Officials posted in Paris could help in its endeavour to know more about the latest find. In the past too, some remains of the two AI planes have been found, strewn over an area of more than one km. \n Five years back, a bag of diplomatic mail that was on board the Boeing 707 which crashed in 1966 was found. The jute bag stamped "diplomatic mail" and "ministry of external affairs" with some Indian newspapers was found in August 2012. \n Discoveries made at the site also include a camera. In 2013, a French alpinist found a metal box containing the Air India logo at the site and rubies, sapphires, and emeralds worth more than \xc2\xa32,25,000. \n According to TOI reports a day after the incident, those on board Bhabha\'s flight included 20 bound for Geneva, 54 for Paris, 24 for London and eight for New York. \n Among passengers were 11 members of a Belgian cultural mission returning from India and 46 seamen from Bombay on their way to Bremen in then West Germany to "pick up" a new ship for the South India Shipping Corporation. \n During an inspection of the wreckage immediately after the accident, personal belongings including cameras, gloves, sets of keys were found. Rescue workers also told of the gruesome sight of 15 dead monkeys buried in the snow. \n Air India archives has details of the November 3, 1950, crash of Flight 245 \xe2\x80\x94 a Lockheed L-749 Constellation registered VT-CQP \xe2\x80\x94 which had 40 passengers and 8 crew on board the Bombay to London via Cairo and Geneva flight. It had crashed on Mont Blanc in France killing all on board. \n The latest remains found at the site were brought down by a helicopter and were due to be examined by experts. Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took charge of the operation. \n "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". AI\'s manager (France) Rajinder Nath spoke to the deputy chief of mission of the Indian embassy. \n "By Saturday night (India time), the Indian embassy had not got a reference from the government of France or local police (Gendarmarie) regarding humans remains discovered at Mont Blanc. They will try to seek more details on Monday and share with AI," said a source after getting the information from Nath. \n'

S' Pune: Two dogs were found dead outside a housing society in Aundh on Saturday. One dog\'s body was missing its head while the other is believed to have been poisoned. \n The bodies were discovered by Amit Shah of Jeev Seva Foundation, who was passing through the area. "I was on my way to Bavdhan when I saw the decapitated body," said Shah. "It was a horrible sight, with blood oozing out from the neck. It appeared the dog was killed only a couple of hours previously," said Shah. \n  The body of the second dog just 20 feet ahead, with foam on its muzzle. Animal activists suspect foul play, because when they returned to the spot with the police, the two bodies had disappeared. Civic workers had removed the headless body, but the body of the poisoned dog could not be accounted for. \n "We asked around, but nobody could had any information about the second body. The PMC had only taken away just the decapitated body," Shah said. \n As neither body was available, they could not lodge an FIR or even do a panchanama. "We cannot be sure whether the headless dog was the victim of an accident or foul play. Also, since the PMC had already buried the body, we did not think it right to exhume it for post-mortem. But the presence of the second dead dog, and its subsequent disappearance is cause for suspicion," Shah said. \n Meanwhile, a police official from Chatushrungi police station, who had visited the spot, said it looked like the dog was decapitated after its head came under the tyre of a vehicle, going by the picture. "We could not do a panchanama as the body had already been picked up," he said. \n'

S'India\'s Hardik Pandya, second left, is congratulated for taking the wicket of Sri Lanka\'s Nuwan Pradeep by his team mates during the third day\'s play. (AP Images)\nGalle: India captain Virat Kohli feels that all-rounder Hardik Pandya has all the skill sets required to emulate world\'s premier all-rounder Ben Stokes.\n "I have a lot of faith in him (Hardik) as far as any format is concerned. If he grows in confidence you see someone like Ben Stokes, what he does for England, brings in great balance as an all-rounder. I see no reason why Hardik Pandya can\'t become that for India," Kohli said at the post- match press conference. \n Kohli singled out Pandya for special mention, praising his second innings bowling apart from his debut half-century.\n "In the first innings, he didn\'t get opportunity to bowl much but I think in the second innings, he bowled really nicely on a wicket that wasn\'t offering much and he kept it in the right areas," said Kohli.\n The skipper was impressed as to how Pandya used the shirt ball and also the speed at which he bowled.\n "He used the bouncer well. He bowls around 135, so he is a great asset and I have mentioned this before as well," he said.\n His whirlwind 50 in the first innings was the difference between a total of 550 and 600.\n "We would have been 540-550 in the first innings. He got those 50 runs quickly and that saves you time as well. That gives you another 15 overs to bowl at the opposition. And his fielding is also tremendous." \n Kohli, in his last Test series against Australia, had an indifferent run but was back in his element in the first Test against Sri Lanka, scoring his 17th Test hundred in only his 58th match.\n "I wasn\'t looking at things from people\'s point of view. I think people on the outside start counting the number of innings when a batsman doesn\'t score well. But for us as batsmen or anyone playing in the eleven, it\'s about what the team wants in that particular situation," said Kohli at the post match press conference after India thrashed Sri Lanka by 304 runs in the first Test here.\n "I think the second innings required us to play a bit more positively and I am glad I was able to do that along with Abhinav Mukund. It helped to get us enough time to get the opposition out and put enough runs on the board for us to feel comfortable.\n "I mean I certainly wasn\'t looking at how many innings I haven\'t scored, because when you are playing all formats you are not thinking which format you have not scored runs in how many innings. You cannot utilise so much energy in that but it always feels good to score runs especially when the team wins," Kohli, who scored 103 not out, added.\n Kohli though felt that his team came up with a "clinical performance", he said there was still room for improvement.\n "Yes, we would like to think we ticked all the boxes with this win. There are still some areas that we can look back and try to improve on. Especially when you get 4-5 wickets, we need to not let the lower order get away with a few runs in the latter half of the innings. It is something that we can identify and work on in the next two games as well.\n "All in all, playing Test cricket after February when we played last, from then having played so much one-day cricket and not having the time to prepare so much in between I think it was good to get back in the groove and do the things that are supposed to be done to win a Test match," said Kohli.\n "From that point of view I would say that we had a pretty good game. As I mentioned we always look for things that we can still improve on, but very happy with the first game."\n Kohli expressed pleasure that his team had become adept at the art of winning Test matches on flat tracks.\n "The last time when we played here on this surface, it offered much more to the bowlers. It kept the bowlers in the game throughout, both the quicks and the spinners more so. This time it was good to bat on even till today, and if you applied yourselves well you could easily score runs on this.\n "So we had to work hard to get all the wickets that we did. I think the bowlers came up with different plans and they persisted long enough to get those breakthroughs. That is something that always helps at the beginning of the series if you get a victory like that on a surface that is not offering much," explained the skipper.\n Kohli said his bowlers have become more confident in their own abilities because of the way they have performed consistently in the last two years.\n "Plus they know what they have to do on the pitch to get people out now which is the most important factor. Especially in Test matches, if you are not getting wickets, then how to contain runs or how to create opportunities to get wickets.\n "Even batsmen have become smarter now. You don\'t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand, they prepare themselves really well, so guys have become more professional in the last two years and they understand how Test matches are won. That understanding of the game is something that has come a long way in the last three years," he said.   \n'

S'Snapshot\nIndia\xe2\x80\x99s macroeconomic numbers are the best they have been in years. But this is offset by a second sobering narrative: of a near-term slowdown that may be hard to reverse using traditional fiscal and monetary policy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two competing economic narratives on India at the moment. They sit uneasily with each other. But both are correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo begins an op-ed by JP Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s Sajjid Z Chinoy published by Mint on 19 July. The piece is titled Indian Economy: A tale of two narratives.\nFor those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t read Chinoy\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed, here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick summary: India\xe2\x80\x99s macroeconomic numbers are the best they have been in years, so much so that \xe2\x80\x9cIndia is considered a safe haven among emerging markets.\xe2\x80\x9d And the government has done its bit with what Chinoy calls \xe2\x80\x9cfour transformational pushes\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cAadhaar, the bankruptcy law, the goods and services tax, and the codification of the new monetary policy framework.\xe2\x80\x9d (I would have included the push-in-the-making, the new fiscal policy framework and made it five). But this is offset by a \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 second, more sobering narrative: of a near-term slowdown that may be hard to reverse using traditional fiscal and monetary policy.\xe2\x80\x9d He goes on to list some of the reasons for slowing growth: a fall in exports; the stabilisation of oil prices; the debt on the books of companies (and the corresponding poor assets on the books of banks); the stress in agriculture; and the incomplete recovery after demonetisation.\nChinoy\xe2\x80\x99s article \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s more good stuff in the piece; do read it \xe2\x80\x93 is a great answer to a question many people have been asking: If the macro is good, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the micro reflecting it? Or the question I posed in the headline of this column: If things are so good, why do we feel so bad?\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s more to it, though. There are reasons beyond structural ones, or short-term disruptions (such as demonetisation, the new real estate act, even the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax) for slowing growth in India. A significant one is the fundamental shift in the dynamics of some industries that has resulted in the narrative turning negative \xe2\x80\x93 at least as far as the incumbents in that industry are concerned. For instance, energy companies that invested huge amounts of money in coal-based thermal power plants a few years ago are suddenly realising that solar energy, which was oh-so-expensive a few years ago, now costs less than coal power. Indian information technology (IT) services companies are under pressure because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t adopted Artificial Intelligence and automation as quickly or as well as they should have. And incumbent telcos have had their businesses wrecked by an aggressive new entrant.\nAnd some industries have been laid low by extraneous factors. India\xe2\x80\x99s once-booming generic pharma business has been hard hit by actions taken by the US drug regulator. To be fair, none of these actions are motivated by protectionist tendencies, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that a once-thriving business is now not-so-thriving. The IT services industry has been affected by a similar extraneous factor, namely the new US visa regime. For both IT services and pharmaceutical companies in India, the US is the biggest market.\nFinally, the predominantly negative sentiment among Indian business leaders can\xe2\x80\x99t be ignored. Some of this is understandable. For instance, demonetisation killed demand for several products and services. But some of it is also prompted by the inability to adjust to the rules-based regime the current government is trying to move towards. When the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) came to power in 2014, most businessmen expected it to be business-friendly. For at least some of them, though, the definition of this term was restricted to whether or not the government was willing to make an exception (or maybe more than one exception) for them. Whatever else you can say about it, the NDA has been loath to oblige on this front.\nSo, what now?\nIs there some magic wand anyone, including the government, can wave and make everyone feel better? Chinoy says the government should \xe2\x80\x9chang in\xe2\x80\x9d till the benefits of such things as GST kick in. He argues that neither fiscal nor monetary interventions will help.\nAt another level, over time, Indian companies will get used to the new dynamics of their businesses, the extraneous factors that are currently worrying them, and, perhaps, the new rules of doing business in the country.\n'

S' The group hopes to do the 724 kilometres (450 miles) between their village and the Baltic in 29 days. (Photo: AFP)\nGassy, Pologne: A group of Poles have assembled tree trunks into a long raft and are streaming down the country\'s longest river, the Vistula, to revive the ancient tradition of timber floating. Their day begins at dawn with a prayer -- "When dawn breaks, the earth, the sea, all of nature praises you" -- which captain Zdzislaw Nikolas sings in his bass voice while the whole crew stands around an image of their patron saint.\nThey sing it at night too like their ancestors, says Nikolas, who sports an impressive handlebar moustache. "Saint Barbara was the patron of those with dangerous jobs, like miners and firefighters and also raftsmen, because that too was a dangerous job: there was a strong river current in the spring," he adds.\nFor centuries, timber floating brought wealth to many villages along the Vistula and its tributaries. Men sent merchandise of all kinds but especially wood from the forests of southern Poland downstream to the Baltic port of Gdansk. "As soon as the ice melted on the Vistula and the currents of the Vistula and the (tributary) San were flowing freely, raft makers got to work and sent the wood floating down to Gdansk," Nikolas says while steering from the back. \n"The whole village of Ulanow did this job and it was often a family affair passed down from father to son. It disappeared with the beginning of the war in 1939 when the German army\'s bombs destroyed the bed of the Vistula river." After the war, timber floating was replaced by trucks and trains. \nWild river\nIn 1991, Nikolas revived a brotherhood of Ulanow raftsmen who organised their first descent last year. "Ours is the most extensive timber floating today in Europe... We do it out of passion, to revive this trade. Not for financial reasons," he said.\nThe crew left Ulanow, a village in the southeast of Poland, on July 2 and floated down the San. They hope to do the 724 kilometres between their village and the Baltic in 29 days. Two weeks in, they were docked on a beach in Gassy, a couple of kilometres from Warsaw. \nTheir raft is made up of four smaller ones assembled by tying together long planks of pinewood. It weighs 50 tonnes and is 70 metres long. The first and last rafts are used to steer. This year the descent is happening as Poland celebrates "The Year of the Vistula". It is a very wild river that has known little development and dredging. Shallow in some areas, there are tree trunks hidden underwater that can jam a raft. \nPolish wood in Amsterdam \nBack in the day the raftsmen put a whole lot at the mercy of the river, Nikolas said. "Wood merchants would entrust their merchandise with the raftsman, who often risked losing everything he owned, his house, his wife and children -- all of which he would bond," he said. "Once the wood arrived in Gdansk, it was cut in saw mills and then exported throughout the world," he added.\n"It is even said that the whole city of Amsterdam was constructed with Polish wood, all of those beautiful houses, entire neighbourhoods of the port made with pine that grew in Poland. These pines were exported to make masts for sailboats in England and Norway." The raftsmen sleep in traditional thatched tents and cook meals on an ever-burning fire.\n"Two weeks into the descent, almost all our supplies are gone," says Zygmunt Osip, as he added cabbage to a big cooking pot. He did last year\'s descent and joined the crew again this year. "I did everything to get time off work and for my wife to let me leave and I succeeded, I\'m here," he told AFP. "For me this trip is as beautiful as first love."\n'

S'Product Purchased by IMBB\nSkin Tone: Medium fair, warm undertones\nHello lovely ladies,\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s review is going to be on a shade from Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick range. The brand has added some gorgeous n*des to their collection. In this post, I am reviewing \xe2\x80\x9cHawkind\xe2\x80\x9d for all of you.\nProduct Description:\n The life-proof lipstick that will not wear off! Yes, you can eat, drink, make up, break up and mouth-off knowing your lips are gonna stay flawless through it all! In 43 shades, this creamy formula glides over lips like a gloss and sets to a true matte finish. Along with 24-hour wear and high-pigment color, the next-generation formula is packed with natural moisturizers, including Vitamin E and Sunflower Seed Wax. All-day wear has never felt so comfortable! Live happily Everlasting! #VeganAlert! 100% cruelty free forever!\n Price and Quantity:\n 1194 PHP for 6.6ml\nIngredients:\nMy Experience with Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick Hawkwind:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with the packaging of the product. The liquid lipstick comes in a black-colored cardboard box with silver detailing. The lipstick comes in a long cylindrical plastic tube. The packaging is very sleek and hence this slender tube can be accommodated easily in any pouch or clutch. The tube is color coded and hence it is easier to spot the shade if you own more than one of these beautiful lipsticks in your stash. The shade name is mentioned at the base of the lipstick tube and also on the outer packaging.\nThe tube closes with screw on cap which has some quirky patterns on it. There is an applicator attached with this cap. The applicator wand is long and does not give much control on the lipstick application. I personally feel that it could have worked better if the wand was slightly smaller. The applicator is typical doe-foot type and hence it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to achieve perfect application with it. Overall, the packaging is classy and travel friendly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkind\xe2\x80\x9d is a beautiful warm-toned plum brown kind of a shade. Such type of colors looks more beautiful on medium to deeper skin tones. The color is bright and dark. It is not exactly a n*de shade for my skin tone but it may be a good one for deeper skin tones. The lipstick sets to a lovely matte finish.\nThis shade is gorgeous but it would have looked better on me if it had some rusty touch. Those who do not prefer wearing such deeper shades may find \xe2\x80\x9cHawkind\xe2\x80\x9d slightly bold for them. In terms of pigmentation, these lipsticks are just amazing. They deliver opaque finish in a single swipe hiding lip pigmentation. The color spreads evenly on the lips but this particular shade looks darker at some places and lighter in certain other places. Overall, it is amazing in terms of color payoff. There is no sheen or shimmer in this lipstick. It has a mild fragrance, which is pleasing and not bothersome at all.\nThe texture of the lipstick is incredibly smooth. The formula is thin but not watery. It is so lightweight and glides on the lips like a dream without causing any drag. The formula is smooth and easy to apply on the lips.\nIt spreads effortlessly on the lips, but since it is a matte lip color, you have to make sure your lips are prepped well as it may cling to the dry patches of the lips. I always prefer exfoliating and moisturizing my lips prior to application for a smooth finish. I have fine lines on my lips but this lipstick does not emphasize those fine lines, in fact makes my lips look smooth. The lipstick does not crumble at all, which is a major concern with these liquid lipsticks.\nThis color goes evenly on the lips without any streaking. The lipstick is waterproof and smudge-proof. Once it sets, it is absolutely transfer-proof. It does not budge even after a full meal. The formula is lightweight and feels super comfortable on the lips. It is absolutely non sticky. It dries out pretty quickly in some 40-50 seconds, so I have to be really quick with application to achieve a perfect finish. I did not find \xe2\x80\x9cHawkind\xe2\x80\x9d dry on my lips but it is not moisturizing either.\nThe lasting power of this shade is somewhere around 6-7 hours without any smudging. It survives normal drink breaks and light snacking but a full oily meal would break down the lipstick and it would fade from the center of the lips. So, it requires reapplication after a heavy meal. The lipstick has a non-staining formula but it can be taken off with a good makeup remover.\nPros of Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick Hawkwind:\nClassy packaging.\nNice applicator.\nPretty shade.\nSuper matte finish.\nAmazingly pigmented.\nMild fragrance.\nNon-drying formula.\nApt for Indian skin tones.\nSmooth texture.\nDries quickly.\nGlides effortlessly.\nDoes not crumble.\nWaterproof.\nSmudgeproof, transferproof.\nNo streaking issues.\nGood staying power.\nCons of Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick Hawkwind:\nApplicator wand is too long.\nPrepping the lips is a must.\nDoes not survive heavy meals.\nIMBB Rating:\n 4.8/5\n Would I Repurchase/Recommend Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick Hawkwind?\n Yes to both.\n'

S'Galle: Popular perceptions do not perturb him, which is the reason why India skipper Virat Kohli does not believe in counting the number of innings in which he had a dry run. Kohli, in his last Test series against Australia, had an indifferent run but was back in his element in the first Test against Sri Lanka, scoring his 17th Test hundred in only his 58th match.\nPic courtesy: twitter.com/ICC\n"I wasn\'t looking at things from people\'s point of view. I think people on the outside start counting the number of innings when a batsman doesn\'t score well. But for us as batsmen or anyone playing in the eleven, it\'s about what the team wants in that particular situation," said Kohli at the post match press conference after India thrashed Sri Lanka by 304 runs in the first Test here.\n "I think the second innings required us to play a bit more positively and I am glad I was able to do that along with Abhinav Mukund. It helped to get us enough time to get the opposition out and put enough runs on the board for us to feel comfortable."\n "I mean I certainly wasn\'t looking at how many innings I haven\'t scored, because when you are playing all formats you are not thinking which format you have not scored runs in how many innings. You cannot utilise so much energy in that but it always feels good to score runs especially when the team wins," Kohli, who scored 103 not out, added.\n Kohli though felt that his team came up with a "clinical performance", he said there was still room for improvement.\nPic courtesy: twitter.com/ICC\n "Yes, we would like to think we ticked all the boxes with this win. There are still some areas that we can look back and try to improve on. Especially when you get 4-5 wickets, we need to not let the lower order get away with a few runs in the latter half of the innings. It is something that we can identify and work on in the next two games as well."\n "All in all, playing Test cricket after February when we played last, from then having played so much one-day cricket and not having the time to prepare so much in between I think it was good to get back in the groove and do the things that are supposed to be done to win a Test match," said Kohli.\n "From that point of view I would say that we had a pretty good game. As I mentioned we always look for things that we can still improve on, but very happy with the first game."\n Kohli expressed pleasure that his team had become adept at the art of winning Test matches on flat tracks.\nPic courtesy: twitter.com/ICC\n "The last time when we played here on this surface, it offered much more to the bowlers. It kept the bowlers in the game throughout, both the quicks and the spinners more so. This time it was good to bat on even till today, and if you applied yourselves well you could easily score runs on this."\n "So we had to work hard to get all the wickets that we did. I think the bowlers came up with different plans and they persisted long enough to get those breakthroughs. That is something that always helps at the beginning of the series if you get a victory like that on a surface that is not offering much," explained the skipper.\n Kohli said his bowlers have become more confident in their own abilities because of the way they have performed consistently in the last two years.\n "Plus they know what they have to do on the pitch to get people out now which is the most important factor. Especially in Test matches, if you are not getting wickets, then how to contain runs or how to create opportunities to get wickets."\n "Even batsmen have become smarter now. You don\'t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand, they prepare themselves really well, so guys have become more professional in the last two years and they understand how Test matches are won. That understanding of the game is something that has come a long way in the last three years," he said. \n'

S" Forest Ministers of various states, including Assam, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Odisha today said the Tiger Reserves and wildlife sanctuaries were in a bad shape and demanded the Centre to provide them with more funds.The Ministers narrated the challenges faced by them at the Global Tiger Day celebration at Vigyan Bhawan here, where Union Minister of Environment and Forest Harsh Vardhan was the chief guest.According to Assam Forest Minister Rani Brahma, there are four Tiger Reserves in Assam, comprising around 50 per cent of the total tiger population in the country. She said the State Government is taking steps to increase it to 76 per cent in the coming years, adding that the State Government was doing its best to provide a conducive environment to the animals.Uttarakhand Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat stressed on research on new farming techniques and ways, so as to benefit the ryots. He further urged the Government to provide more money for increasing the grass cover of the state. Mr Rawat also demanded setting up of a surveillance system in the forest areas of Uttarakhand, so as to arrest poachers and illegal activities.Forest Minister of Madhya Pradesh Gauri Shankar Shejwar said the State Government has taken various steps to increase the population of tigers, which has shown an upward trend in the last eight years. ''We have increased tiger population by almost 40 per cent in the last eight years and intend to increase it further to 60 per cent in the coming years,'' he added. According to Odisha Forest and Environment Minister Bijayshree Routray, the state is using camera tap technique, to get a hold of tiger population. He demanded giving a free hand to the Police and Forest Departments of the state, to save the forests and animals. Malenistic Tiger, commonly known as Black Tiger, which is a rare animal, is only found in Odisha, he added. UNI RJ SNU 1942\n"

S'DSK Benelli has confirmed to Carandbike.com, the Benelli TRK 502is coming in January 2018 in the sub 500 cc adventure tourer segment and is expected to be priced around Rs. 5 lakh (ex-showroom).\nAfter a long wait, DSK Benelli is finally gearing up to introduce its much-awaited motorcycles showcased at the 2016 Auto Expo, and now, we have a timeline for some of its launches. The bike maker has lined up three more launches for the 2017-18 fiscal including the Benelli TRK 502 adventure tourer. Speaking to Carandbike.com on the sidelines of the Benelli 302R launch, DSK Motowheels - Chairman, Shirish Kulkarni said, "That\'s [Benelli TRK 502] happening in January 2018. The bike will be launched before the Expo."\n Also Read: Benelli 302R launched in India \nDSK Benelli first showcased the TRK 502 at the 2016 Auto Expo after its global unveil at the 2015 EICMA Motorcycle Show and is seen as an affordable middleweight adventure tourer. In fact, the Benelli TRK 502 was expected to lead the charge in the segment, but the launch was indefinitely delayed for a number of reasons. When asked about the delay, Kulkarni clarified that while Benelli was ready to introduce the non-ABS road spec version, DSK only wanted to get the ABS-equipped, off-road version to India.\nThe DSK Benelli TRK 502 won\'t have direct competition around the Rs. 5 lakh price point\nKulkarni elaborated, "The TRK 502 is ready, everything is done. We have to get it certified that\'s all. I said I\'m not even taking it because there is no ABS. So you [Benelli] give me an off-road ABS version and I will pick it up today. People want the off-road ABS version."\nWith ABS to be mandatory on 125 cc and above two wheelers starting April 2018, it also makes little business sense to bring the non-ABS model, Kulkarni explained. "Why should I launch it and sell it and then keep the normal braking system in stock as a spare part forever. I might as well wait one year and they give me the product that I want," he added.\nDSK Benelli TRK 502 gets a new 500 cc parallel-twin engine\nShirish Kulkarni also confirmed that there are no immediate plans to bring the TRK 302 to India, contrary to speculations. The bike was expected to be a direct rival to the Royal Enfield Himalayan and a smaller version of the TRK 502. However, given that the price difference between both models won\'t be huge, the company isn\'t keen on bringing the 300 cc version.\nThe Benelli TRK 502 garnered positive feedback when showcased at the 2016 Auto Expo and will draw power from a 500 cc liquid-cooled, parallel-twin engine tuned for 47 bhp of power and 45 Nm of torque. The motor will be paired to a 6-speed gearbox, and will come with studded tyres and spoked wheels. In fact, a ground clearance of 230 mm seals its credentials of being an off-roader.\n Also Read: DSK Benelli to launch new quarter-litre street motorcycle at the 2018 Auto Expo \nThe Benelli TRK 502 will be available in the single off-road variant\nThe suspension setup includes USD front forks with 150 mm of travel and a monoshock setup at the rear. The 20-litre fuel tank also promises lesser fuel stops on the ride. Braking performance comes from 320 mm twin front discs and a 260 mm single disc at the rear, along with a Bosch sourced ABS unit. The off-road version will come with 19-inch front and 17-inch rear spoked wheels, wrapped in studded tyres.\nThe Benelli TRK 502 is on sale in the UK for around Rs. 5 lakh while prices in Malaysia start from Rs. 4.5 lakh (India equivalent) onwards. In India, prices are expected to above Rs. 5 lakh (ex-showroom) for the TRK 502 with the bike arriving as a Completely Knocked Down (CKD) unit.

S'A map showing all the cities and towns from where Bangladesh\'s Test cricketers have come\n "If it wasn\'t for my brother Poltu, I wouldn\'t have reached this stage today," Mustafizur Rahman told a packed press conference room after leading Bangladesh to their first win over India in three years on his ODI debut. \n Whenever there was a trial, a training camp or a match in Satkhira, the district town in south-west Bangladesh, 38km from their village, Tetulia, Poltu would drive his younger brother there and back on his motorcycle. After two years of being ferried around, in 2013, Mustafizur made it to Dhaka through an age-level pace-bowling clinic. \n Among the 13 Test debutants Bangladesh have had in the last two years, only Taskin Ahmed is from Dhaka. The rest are from smaller towns such as Jamalpur, Narayanganj, Satkhira, Dinajpur, Rangpur and Mymensingh, or divisional headquarters like Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal. More than ever before, Bangladesh\'s cricketers now come from every corner of the country. \n Bangladesh\'s population of 164 million is a hindrance in almost every aspect of its economy and society. Geographically the country is roughly the size of the Indian state of Odisha, which means its population density is more than twice that of India. \n But when it comes to cricket, the population is a distinct advantage. The love and interest for the game, and the national team\'s recent success, has triggered a deluge of cricketers from across the country. Small towns and villages are now the prime producers of talents like Mustafizur, Mehidy Hasan and Mosaddek Hossain. \n   "It is rare to see a player like Mosaddek, who takes so much responsibility. We look for impact players, not the one who scores the most runs or takes most wickets"  \n Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, BCB\'s high performance manager \n Mustafizur\'s path to the Bangladesh team from the fringes of the country\'s south-west was described by many as a fairy tale. But in reality, it was a triumph of the system - the Bangladesh Cricket Board\'s development programme and a robust talent-scouting network across the country. \n****\n The board\'s game development committee is headed by chairman Khaled Mahmud, the former Bangladesh captain, and there\'s a separate high-performance unit, run by Mahbubul Anam, the board\'s vice-president. \n In the last ten years, the development programme has expanded to every district. At this level, the target is to create opportunities for all interested young players. After age verification through medical testing, teams are formed to play in the inter-district competitions (on matting wickets). The players then go on to to age-level divisional tournaments (played on natural turf) - two-day games for U-14 and U-16 and three-day games for U-18s. \n There\'s also a three-team challenger series, a relatively new competition that features three-day matches, played by the best age-group cricketers in the country. \n****\n When debutant Mosaddek Hossain came to the crease at No. 8 in the first innings of the Colombo Test in March this year, Bangladesh were still 48 runs adrift of Sri Lanka\'s first-innings total. Facing Rangana Herath, who had taken nine wickets in the previous Test, Mosaddek used his feet to drive through the covers and then made room by skipping towards leg side to loft the ball over long-off. \n Then in the second innings, towards the end of Bangladesh\'s tricky chase, Mosaddek stepped out and slammed Herath again, this time over cover. One man who was not surprised at the 21-year-old\'s confidence against one of the top-ranked spinners in the world was Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, the BCB\'s high performance manager. He believes that the path Mosaddek took - from his formative years in Mymensingh through the age-group system, then domestic cricket and into the international arena - helped him gain the ability to easily adapt to the match situation. \n Fahim, regarded as one of the most influential coaches in Bangladesh in the last two decades, says that nowadays Bangladeshi coaches are instructed to find "impact" players. \n "Mosaddek absorbs what\'s around him very quickly," Fahim said to ESPNcricinfo. "He is comfortable with his environment. Not many players can do this. He dissolves himself into the contest. It is rare to see a player like Mosaddek, who takes so much responsibility. We look for impact players, not the one who scores the most runs or takes most wickets." \nMosaddek Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman come from parts of Bangladesh that aren\'t traditional cricket powerhouses\n Mosaddek came through the ranks in the age-group system, becoming an U-19 star before blazing a trail in domestic cricket. He starred for Abahani Limited, the country\'s most successful cricket club, in the 2016 Dhaka Premier League, and struck three first-class double-hundreds before making his international debut in 2016. \n Fahim notes a similar attitude in Mehidy, who burst onto the international scene against England last year. Not long after Mehidy started training under Sheikh Salahuddin in Khulna, he was made captain at different age levels. \n "Local coaches in Bangladesh now realise what type of cricketers are required at the international level," says Fahim. "Nazmul Hossain and Mosaddek are similar to Miraz [Mehidy] - they have the attitude and personality to play at the top level. \n "These characteristics are being recognised, apart from players who are fearless, take ownership and are independent. We are encouraging the players\' freedom of expression. They will know what to do and how to prepare for it." \n Among these players, Mustafizur was a late developer, having to travel out of his village to get recognition. \n Mufassinul Islam Topu, head coach of Satkhira district, saw Mustafizur playing in the town around 2011-12. "He came to our U-14 camp after a regional tournament, and straightaway I understood we had something special on our hands." \n  Between 1982 and 1996, the Nirman school tournament produced future Test cricketers like Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mahmud and Javed Omar. They were the cream of the crop, but an entire generation of professional cricketers came through this tournament \n "We are mainly focused on finding players to push to the next level. The ultimate goal is to find a talent who can represent Bangladesh. That isn\'t possible every day, but I try to make sure that everybody gets an opportunity to show themselves." \n After he was spotted by scouts in Satkhira, Mustafizur was included in a pace bowling clinic at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. That\'s where he developed his famous slower balls and cutters by bowling at many different types of batsmen. After playing in the 2014 U-19 World Cup, he was picked for the Bangladesh A tour to West Indies, and less than a year later, he played for the senior team. \n Fahim says that the discovery of Mustafizur is shining proof of how well the board\'s development programme has spread across the country. \n "We believe we can find any talent from anywhere in Bangladesh. It is slowly becoming a pan-Bangladesh effort, which gives boys from smaller towns more opportunities. \n "Previously, a boy from a small town would have a hard time figuring out how to become a cricketer in Bangladesh. Now they have a local hero like Soumya Sarkar from Satkhira, Imrul Kayes from Meherpur, or Mehidy Hasan from Khulna. They now know the path to becoming a professional." \n A player\'s success can also prompt an increase in grass-roots level participation in the region he comes from. \nThe board\'s development programme now touches nearly every part of the country and there are proper channels for young talent to be recognised and nurtured\n "I would say that [in Satkhira, because of Mustafizur] there has been at least a 50% increase in the number of kids who now flock to cricket training, especially at the youngest level," says Mufassinul. \n****\n For four decades Bangladesh found its cricketers through the Dhaka clubs, who scouted for players and provided them with financial support. Cricketers would have to catch the eye of a coach or a team official to make it. The club network grew from Dhaka to cities like Chittagong, Rajshahi, Sylhet and Khulna and then to smaller towns, but it was mostly down to the cricketers showing up at the right time, starring in the right tournament. \n The BCB\'s development system was put in place soon after the country got Test status in 2000, but the foundations were, in fact, laid in the \'80s. \n Kamal Ziaul Islam, better known as KZ, was the board president from 1983 to 1987, and the driving force behind a school tournament that for long served as a feeder system to the clubs and the national team. \n Islam\'s company Nirman Constructions bankrolled the tournament for 14 seasons, starting from 1982-83, and during that time, schoolboys in Bangladesh knew that the first step towards becoming a cricketer was to play "Nirman". The competition grew from 22 schools in the inaugural year to 410 by 1995-96. The BCB funded the event for two seasons after that before private banks arrived as sponsors. Participation remained high, with the number of schools crossing 1000 in the last decade. Prime Bank Limited have been sponsoring the tournament for the last two years, though only 508 schools took part this year. \n   "Previously a boy from a small town would have a hard time figuring out how to become a cricketer in Bangladesh. Now they have a local hero like Soumya Sarkar from Satkhira, Imrul Kayes from Meherpur, or Mehidy Hasan from Khulna"  \n Mufassinul Islam Topu, head coach of Satkhira district \n Since the BCB formed its own development programme, the school cricket tournament has been more about participation and less about talent-sourcing. But between 1982 and 1996, Nirman produced future Test cricketers like Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mahmud and Javed Omar. They were the cream of the crop, but an entire generation of professional cricketers came through this tournament. A Nirman XI played in the Dhaka league system for about a decade. It had foreign coaches and even an English cricketer - Alan Fordham - playing for the side in the 1989-90 season in the Dhaka Premier League. \n Contemporary cricketers like Mohammad Sharif, Sarkar and Nazmul also made their way to the national side after having started in the school tournament. \n****\n In a Bangladesh Premier League match in December last year, 17-year old debutant offspinner Afif Hossain took 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, against Chittagong Vikings. When journalists scrambled to get more information on this previously unknown player, it was found that Afif was an opening batsman who could also chip in as an allrounder. \n Coaches in Bangladesh say there are many like him coming through the system. Zakir Hasan, who played in the 2016 U-19 World Cup, is a designated wicketkeeper, but one coach said he was a better general fielder than a wicketkeeper. He also opens the batting and is comfortable against pace bowling. \n It has taken more than 15 years for Bangladesh to develop into a team that opposition sides truly respect. The passion for the game across the country, represented by the talent waiting in the wings, is proof that administrations must be patient when asking a country to develop their cricket. Bangladesh may not be an overnight success story, but they are slowly becoming a long-term one. \n'

S'The world may know the hero that Supergirl becomes under Superman\xe2\x80\x99s wing\xe2\x80\xa6 but what if she was raised as Jim Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s daughter \xe2\x80\x93 and the future Batgirl\xe2\x80\x99s sister? We\xe2\x80\x99re about to find out, thanks to Gotham City Garage, an American wasteland inhabited by DC\xe2\x80\x99s younger generation of heroes surviving on motorcycles and rebellion, delivered in Digital First comic book form. It may have been a DC Collectible of Wonder Woman gone Full Throttle that sparked the series into existence, but it\xe2\x80\x99s Supergirl at the heart of the story. And in this outlaw vision of the DC Universe, it\xe2\x80\x99s Kara Gordon who emerges as the world\xe2\x80\x99s first superhero.\nWhen the first details of Gotham City Garage\xe2\x80\x98s world were released, the fact that Supergirl a.k.a Kara Danvers now shared her last name with the police commissioner of Gotham City was a detail that stuck out. And when we got the chance to discuss the series with writers Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly, they told us of the new identity for Supergi\xe2\x80\x93 sorry, Kara Gordon, and how different (or not so different) a version emerging into a world without Superman might be.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still a coming of age story for both Kara Gordon and her sister, Barbara. A sibling duo fans could only previously have dreamed of, but one that sounds like it will do justice to the skills and agency of both. Albeit in a very, very different version of the DC Universe. Lanzing explains the new take:\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t give too much away because that\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a secret in our first couple issues, but what we can say is the two got raised as sisters. Kara Gordon is the daughter of Jim Gordon who is himself still police commissioner of the LEXES city state. So while Barbara went and worked for The Bat, Kara was just a tech, she has a normal job working a totally normal nine to five.\nShe literally programs the little mind control machines that are in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s brains. She does tech support for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind control device. But she has always felt like an outsider; always felt like there was something different about her. She has that feling that I think any young person has growing up into a more corporate society, when they realize once I become a cog in this machine, is that all I am? And Barbara has a place that is fulfilling for her, but Kara doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. And when Kara realizes that there is more to life than this, that\xe2\x80\x99s the meat of our whole first issue. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to seek out something different.\nThe duo aren\xe2\x80\x99t revealing too many details about the \xe2\x80\x9cDark Age\xe2\x80\x9d that killed all of the superheroes in the older generation, or whether GCG\xe2\x80\x98s take on Batman may have insight into Superman\xe2\x80\x99s apparent death. What DC did reveal was the first look at Kara Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s design for the series, showing that Kara makes her home among the outlaws of the wasteland sooner rather than later.\nLanzing and Kelly explained that since neither Superman nor the Superman symbol have any meaning in Kara\xe2\x80\x99s world, she adopts the image because she simply likes it. Spray painting it on her jacket (and apparently adorning her pants with some Kryptonian characters?), Kara will be as different, and yet familiar to fans as her costume. Kelly explains the distinction:\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a certain fundamental aspect of these characters that\xe2\x80\x99s never going to change. Kara Gordon, whether her name is Kara Gordon or Kara Danvers, is always going to be a hero in her core. But how she gets there is going to be different depending on the circumstances in her world.\nDuring the Dark Age, during this big event, the heroes of the world \xe2\x80\x93 the Justice Society, the heroes that we know \xe2\x80\x93 they got wiped out. So in a lot of the cases the women who were their sidekicks had to actualize without these men in their lives. So without those men to be the heroes that can be looked up to, they were forced to become their own heroes. As for the bikes of it all, well they live in the freescape \xe2\x80\x93 there are not a lot of ways to get around. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make each female hero have to step up and become the hero we otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known.\nWe know that same treatment will extend to at least one infamous femme fatale in DC\xe2\x80\x99s Universe, with this new take on Harley Quinn making Joker HER sidekick, but the freedom to forge her own path may be most felt in the story of Supergirl.\nFinally, for fans hoping that Kara wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the only superhuman or superwoman walking the Earth, Lanzing revealed that the woman whose biker design started it all will appear. And when she does\xe2\x80\xa6 Kara\xe2\x80\x99s world will change all over again:\nKara Gordon is the first Kryptonian hero the world has ever seen. In our book, Wonder Woman is a myth. She is a word on the wind. This symbol of hope that most people don\xe2\x80\x99t even think is really a thing anymore. So when she shows up, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be amazing.\nFans of Supergirl can see for themselves how a childhood in Jim Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s home and city would shape the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s identity when Gotham City Garage begins in August. Oh, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry: based on the black leather biker version of Barbara, it would seem Batgirl follows her sister into the lawless wasteland before too long.\nGothan City Garage #1 will arrive August 16, 2017, with a new chapter released biweekly through October 2017 and weekly thereafter, with print issues available in October.\n'

S'Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\n In January 1966, an Air India plane crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing 177 people. (Photo: Representational/File)\nGrenoble: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said Friday.\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before," he said. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\n'

Followed by sun. Followed by relaxation. Indeed, this beautiful Caribbean nation\xe2\x80\x94which occupies the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola, and shares a border with Haiti\xe2\x80\x94has risen in popularity over the past decade thanks to its numerous all-inclusive resorts. Many people choose to book a flight right into Punta Cana, a town with over 20 miles of beachfront and numerous hotels offering everything from golf to spas to world-class dining.\nBut there are other sides to the Dominican Republic, too. Up north, in the province of Puerto Plata, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the laid-back beach town of Cabarete. Popular with outdoor enthusiasts and sports lovers, Cabarete is known for its standout kitesurfing, kayaking, kiteboarding, and surfing. About an hour to the east lies Playa Grande, a mile-long crescent-shaped beach that borders the beautiful Amanera, a resort that made Travel + Leisure\xe2\x80\x99s It List of the best new hotels of the year.

S'Star writer Vijayendra Prasad is now the most sought after director in the entire India. He has been preparing scripts for some mind blowing projects. This naive writer has opened up on working with the mighty director Sankar.\nIn a recent interaction with some media person, Vijayendra Prasad has revealed his future projects in Hindi. Apart from providing story and screenplay for Krish\xe2\x80\x99s Manikarnika, he is writing stories for two sequels. One is the sequel of super hit flick Naayak which is the official Hindi remake of Tamil blockbuster Mudhalvan (Oke Okkadu). Other is Rowdy Rathode\xe2\x80\x99s sequel starring Akshay Kumar. When he was questioned if he would provide the story for Sankar\xe2\x80\x99s future project, Vijayendra Prasad stunned the interviewer with his answer. He declared that he would not give a chance to Sankar to approach him for a story but he would rather prepare a story for Sankar and ask him to direct in a pleasing manner.\nVijayendra Prasad rated Sankar as the top director of India in the present generation. Talking about his son Rajamouli\xe2\x80\x99s next, he still maintained silence by saying that the story discussions are still going on.\n'

S'An author, who shuffles between Ottawa and Mumbai, invites you to walk with him on the city\'s fascinating sidewalks in a new book\nHarsha Dehejia looks at paintings by street artists on the Kala Ghoda stretch leading to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. Pic/Sayyed Sameer Abedi\nSitting under a tree on a footpath that connects Jehangir Art Gallery with CSMVS, an astrologer reads the kundalis and palms of those keen to know their future. Nearby, a quack sells jadi buti (herbal medicines) sourced from the jungles of India. "Sometimes, will digging up medicines, a snake or scorpion jumps at me," he regales Harsha V Dehejia, as the latter strikes up a conversation with him.\nA hawker at Ranade Road in Dadar. \xe2\x80\x9cEven art comes alive on a footpath,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dehejia. Pic/Datta Kumbhar\nThese anecdotes that Dehejia, 79, indulges in while strolling down the heritage precinct of Kala Ghoda are part of a 30-minute DVD that accompanies the second edition of his book, Walk With Me On Mumbai Footpaths (Wilco), launched recently.\nIn the DVD, you\'ll also find tete-a-tetes with Amin Sayani and Shobhaa De. "Mumbai\'s footpaths have a life of their own. Many people have started their careers and lives on these footpaths and gone on to become billionaires and movie stars," says De in the video.\nLook closer at Pedder Road: On an afternoon stroll on the street in 1980s, Dehejia spotted a cobbler solving a crossword puzzle and down the road, a man sleeping in a bathtub. Pics courtesy/Harsha Dehejia\nBlast from the past\nBorn and bred in Malabar Hill, Dehejia\'s fascination with footpaths traces back to his college days when he would walk down from Flora Fountain to elphinstone College. That\'s where he first met the aforementioned astrologer and quack. "I would spend a lot of a time at a street bookstore near Central Telegraph Office. I would also spot artists sketching on the pavements. Today, even 50 years later, you still find these treasures on footpaths. If you talk to those who work or live on them, you\'ll realise that their courage in trying to make a living is exemplary," says Dehejia, who has a double doctorate, one in medicine and another in ancient Indian culture. Previously, he has authored books on Krishna.\nIn 1970, he shifted base to Ottawa (Canada) in 1970 where is a faculty member at Carleton University, and also runs a radio show. "However, I hold a strong connect with Mumbai, visiting it at least once a year."\nWhat\'s in the book?\nA condensed version of the previous edition (2011), the book features over 100 photographs, which capture interesting people, and activities that take place on the city\'s footpaths on a daily basis. In one, a typist sits with his instrument drafting a letter near GPO, while a man naps in a bathtub-turned-bed on Pedder Road in another. The frames also showcase clay pots filled with water placed at a footpath in Chembur, a student preparing for an exam under a street lamp in Worli and kids using a pavement to play gully cricket in Borivali.\n"Mumbai\'s footpaths are full of life, brotherhood, colours, enterprise and commerce, and religion. You\'ll spot many roadside shrines, which may be illegal from the municipal sense, but offer solace to those living and walking on the footpaths. You\'ll often see passersby stop at the shrine to offer a prayer. However, to discover their true beauty, you need to rid yourself of the notion that they are chaotic and dirty, and meet them with an open heart."\nMany frames date back to 1980s, when Dehejia would pick up his camera and roam around the streets of Mumbai. "Then, in 2007, I was at a coffee shop, showing these photographs to [late historian] Sharada Dwivedi, who suggested that I bring out a book. That\'s how the project began," he recalls. The book also features photographs contributed by his friends and photographers, Rafiq elias, Chirodeep Chaudhroi and Sailesh Mule among others, along with illustrations by cartoonist Hemant Morparia.\nDid you know?\nAccording to Dehejia, the street opposite Wilson College at Chowpatty is the only one in Mumbai named after a footpath\n'

S' Buildings built in that style still exist on R.P. Road, Jhirra and Begum Bazar \nMumbai has recently been recognised as a city with the second largest number of Art Deco buildings in the world, second only to Miami. \nWhat many people in the city are not aware of is that Hyderabad has an equally large number of buildings designed in the Art Deco style. \nThe architectural style was popular in the 30s and 40s of the last century with many cinema halls, offices and even homes being designed in the idiom.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few weeks ago, on a whim we walked the streets of R.P. Road and Jhirra area in Secunderabad and we saw a huge number of buildings that were part of the Art Deco movement with their delicate jali work in concrete, curved balconies, staircases and covered ceilings. Every time we walk those streets, we discover something new,\xe2\x80\x9d says P. Pravin, an architect, who is planning to map the Art Deco buildings in the city with Harsha Devulapalli, a researcher in Columbia University\xe2\x80\x99s Urban Design Lab. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Moazzam building is an Art Deco structure that has lost prominence. The Monda Market clock tower is another Art Deco masterpiece. All the beauties on R.P. Road are a sight. A number of cinema halls like Deepak, Shanti and Saptagiri were also part of the Art Deco movement. Unfortunately, I keep hearing the plans of their demolition,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Devulapalli.\nThe transition from Colonial, Vernacular and Gothic building styles to a modern idiom was gradual in the city. It can be traced back to Karl Malte von Heinz, the Austro-German architect who lived in India and designed some of the iconic buildings in Delhi, Hyderabad and Bombay. One of the buildings he built in Hyderabad was the Kohinoor at Banjara Hills which has now given way for a shopping mall.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Art Deco movement was very big in the 1930s and 40s in the city and many people belonging to the mercantile class got their houses and offices designed in the style. Clusters of them still exist on R.P. Road, Jhirra and Begum Bazar areas. Unfortunately, now many of them are run down, have water seepage problem and vegetal growth. Many of the houses have been let out to tenants and there are other issues hampering the mapping work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anuradha Reddy of Intach, who is co-ordinating the effort.\n'

S'Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n Grenoble :  \nBody parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources have said.\n Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n "I had never found any significant human remains before", he told AFP on Saturday. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n "These remains are probably not from the same person", said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diableretsmassif in the Swiss Alps.\n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\nFirst Published: Saturday, July 29, 2017 11:03 AM\n Download the News Nation Mobile App and stay connected with top stories from India and around the world.

S' This is the second of a three-part series, "Resilience in the of the Eye of the Storm," on how Bangladesh has become a leader in coastal resilience. \n With a population of 160 million, Bangladesh is situated at the epicenter of some of the deadliest cyclones the world has ever experienced. Catastrophic events are the norm rather than the exception. A severe tropical cyclone can strike every 3 years and 25% of the land floods annually.\n The network of the mighty Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna rivers makes its meandering journey through the delta into the Bay of Bengal forming the coast of Bangladesh.\n The jagged coastline of Bangladesh spans hundreds of miles and is subject to multiple challenges: 62% of the coastal land has an elevation of up to 3 meters and 83% is up to 5 meters above sea level. These low-lying areas are highly vulnerable to natural hazards.\n Earlier this year, I got a chance to see first-hand the challenges that this demanding landscape had brought onto the communities of a remote coastal village. What struck me most when speaking to members of this coastal community was their courage and resilience. Aware that a calamity can hit anytime, they struggle to protect their livelihoods affected by saltwater intrusion, and their own lives which are increasingly at risk due to rising sea levels, and exposure to more frequent and devastating storms and cyclones.\n By 2050, the coastal population is projected to grow to 61 million people, whose livelihoods will increasingly be at risk due to the impact of climate change.\n Triggered by climate change, seawater inundation could become a major problem for traditional agriculture. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (2014), climate-related declines in food productivity will impact livelihoods and exports and increase poverty. In Bangladesh, it is estimated that these factors would cause a net increase in poverty of 15% by 2030.\n To mitigate against such risks, the government has been investing in strengthening the resilience of the coastal zone. Over the years, Bangladesh has become an example of how protective coastal infrastructure, together with social mobilization and community-based early warning systems, is helping to build resilience.\n Initiatives began in the 1960s when the coastal embankment system \xe2\x80\x93 known as polders \xe2\x80\x93 was first set up. This was done to protect communities and farmlands from flooding and saltwater intrusion associated with higher tide levels. Since then, the government has supported coastal populations by expanding areas protected in polders.\n The World Bank helped the government through successive programs, such as Emergency 2007 Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project (ECRRP) and Coastal Embankment Improvement Project, phase 1 (CEIP I) to repair and rehablitate embankments, and rebuild the accompanying drainage infrastructure. Design standards have now incorporated storm surges and climate changes scenarios which were not part of the initial design of the coastal embankments. \n Implementing such investments is far from easy. The remote locations and the geographic dispersal of the work across a vast and poorly connected landscape - along with the resulting difficulty of coordination, equipment mobilization, labor, and management - all reflect the enormity of the challenge ahead.\n So far, these investments have helped protect the lives and assets of those living within polder boundaries. The community will also benefit from better crop yields, which will increase food security and create jobs.\n Yet, the job is far from done. Many more polders and drainage infrastructure need to be rehabilitated and millions more coastal residents need to be protected. Most importantly, strenghtening coastal resilience must be done in an inclusive and sustainable manner.\n Bangladesh serves as a global example of how people are adapting to local hazards and climate change, in some of the most vulnerable and remote places on earth. As a signatory to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, Bangladesh has committed to investing in risk reduction, strengthening resilience, and building back better. \n As I looked over the crest of the embankment towards the paddy fields, I thought that it may not be too long before the next storm hits. But then, the community\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods will be ready and better protected.\n ECRRP, CEIP Phase I, and MDSP  are projects financed by the World Bank\xe2\x80\x94with grant support from the  Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery  (GFDRR), the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund, and the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience\xe2\x80\x94aim to increase the resiliency of vulnerable communities to future disasters and achieve the twin goals of boosting shared prosperity and eradicating extreme poverty.

S'With the help of the Interpol and the Internet Watch Foundation, the Centre has managed to block more than 3,500 websites peddling child pornography in the last four months. \nPicture for representation\nThe Narendra Modi government has joined forces with international bodies like the Interpol and Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to end the menace of child pornography and online abuse of kids in India. With their help, a total of 3,522 such sites have been blocked in the past four months, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday.\nThe apex court had on February 24 noted that there is a surge in photographs and videos on the internet showing kids being sexually exploited and a sharp rise in the number of child pornographic sites while it asked the Centre to act immediately.\n"The Interpol maintains a \'worst of list\' prepared by the Internet Watch Foundation. They have shared it with the CBI and the government is now ordering the blocking through select internet service providers. Last blocking was done in June 2017 and around 3,522 websites have been blocked," said the Centre\'s affidavit filed by additional solicitor general Pinky Anand.\nAccording to experts, the advent of digital cameras and camcorders has fuelled an explosion in such material available online.\nMail Today reported in December that the Centre had roped in international police agency Interpol to fight child pornography. The government said an inter-ministerial committee has been formed for curbing online child sex abuse material. \nIt recommended that till such time a centralised mechanism is built in India to dynamically monitor websites and URLs containing online child sex abuse material (CSAM), the relevant internet service providers should disable or remove such content dynamically based on IWF resources.\nIt said "the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has issued an order to Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) and Department of Telecommunications to disable or remove access to child porn sites by adopting IWF list to prevent distribution and transmission of online CSAM into India. The order is to be implemented by relevant ISPs in India".\nNO CENTRALISED MECHANISM IN INDIA\nElaborating on why international help was sought, the affidavit said most of the child sex abuse material is being hosted outside India and the websites/URLs to such content are dynamic in nature and frequently changing, making it difficult to block such content. \n"No centralised mechanism exists in India to monitor online CSAM", it said. Experts say the advent of digital cameras and camcorders has fuelled an explosion in such material available online.\nIn 2015, there were 96 reports in India of children being sexually exploited in internet imagery, a rise of 140 per cent from the previous year, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data.\nThe SC was hearing PILs filed by Indore-based advocate Kamlesh Vaswani and Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association seeking a direction to the government to adopt various measures for the effectiveness of blocking child pornography on Internet.\nInterpol is a major source of getting access to websites containing child sexual abuse. The agency maintains a regular update of the "worst" of such sites. \nInterpol was tasked by the UN General Assembly in 2009 to maintain and disseminate to the national central bureaus a worldwide list of URLs, which contains these websites that publish the most severe child abuse material.\nOrdering a crackdown against child porn, the SC had said that one needs to draw a distinct line between art and obscenity, and child pornography cannot be justified in the name of freedom of speech and expression.\nNot just child porn. The SC had asked the Centre to find out "ways and means" to block all kinds of pornography on the internet, saying obscenity, which is a crime under Indian law "cannot be allowed to be perpetuated".\nSignificantly, the court is also exploring possibility of banning watching of pornographic materials in any form at public places.\nThe SC\'s instructions came despite stiff objection from the Centre, which said it only favoured banning child pornography sites and not "going beyond" considering a citizen\'s right to privacy and did not want to be seen as "moral policing". \nBut the court directed the government to "develop a mechanism" for blocking all porn sites with the help of Information Technology experts and service providers.\n'

S'Heavy rainfall and water released from the Jawai Dam have flooded parts of Jalore and neighbouring areas in Rajasthan, officials said today. \n More than 70,000 cusec of water were released from the dam - the largest in western Rajasthan - yesterday evening. \n Heavy downpour also affected normal life in the adjoining Pali and Sirohi districts, where many villages are on high alert and relief and rescue operations are carrying on. \n Three gates of the dam were opened on Thursday and eight more were opened last night, after the level of water rose above 60 feet. \n "Of the total 13 gates, 11 were opened last night to discharge water. Seven gates were closed in the morning and four are still open," said Vinod Kumar Malhotra, sub- divisional magistrate (SDM) of Sumerpur town in Pali district. \n The water level in the dam was 59 feet at present. \n "Many villages in Jalore are flooded, and some roads have been washed away. Relief work is underway," L N Soni, the Collector of Jalore, said. \n Soni said the district administrations in Pali and Jalore had alerted villagers before the gates were opened. \n "People in several hundred villages in Pali, Sirohi and Jalore had been affected by the flood-like situation," the district collector said. \n In many villages, people were being rescued from their rooftops by the Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), he added. \n "Rescue operations are being carried out," Hemant Gera, Secretary of state Disaster Management and Relief department said. \n Various parts of Rajasthan have been experiencing heavy rainfall. \n Chittoragarh recorded a maximum of 129 millimetres till this morning, followed by Rawatbhata, which received 104.9 mm of rain, followed by Mount Abu, which recorded 101 mm of rain. \nBhilwara, Ajmer, Dabok, Kota and Bundi received 65.2, 54.6, 49, 21 and 20 mm of rain respectively, while many other areas recorded below 20 mm rains during this period.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'Executive Summary\nAlthough 86% of American employees have no access to paid parental leave, at elite firms access is growing. The paid-parental-leave arms race is red hot because employers see a unique opportunity to nab talent and headlines by one-upping their competitors. But employers often shoot themselves in the foot by designing old-fashioned leave policies that undercut their recruitment and retention goals and may expose them to public relations backlash and legal liability. The most common misstep is making paid leave contingent on employees identifying as \xe2\x80\x9cprimary caregivers.\xe2\x80\x9d When it comes to leave for new parents, you need just two simple categories: disability leave for women who are physically unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and parental leave available equally to all employees regardless of gender or caregiver status.\nAn employee handbook update doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually merit a press release and glossy promotional video \xe2\x80\x94 except when there\xe2\x80\x99s a benefits arms race on. The paid-parental-leave arms race is red-hot because employers see a unique opportunity to nab talent and headlines by one-upping their competitors. Although 86% of American employees have no access to paid parental leave, at elite firms access is growing. Six weeks! 20 weeks! A full year! From 2015 to 2017, more than 75 large companies issued press releases touting new or expanded parental leave policies. Forward-thinking companies recognize that generous paid parental leave and other family-friendly policies provide reputational benefits, confer a competitive edge in recruitment, and increase employee productivity and retention.\nSad fact: Employers often shoot themselves in the foot by designing old-fashioned leave policies that undercut their recruitment and retention goals and may expose them to public relations backlash and legal liability. The most common misstep is making paid leave contingent on employees identifying as \xe2\x80\x9cprimary caregivers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPrimary-caregiver policies are holdovers from the days when maternity leave was available to birth mothers only, with partners and adoptive parents left out in the cold. Such policies reflect the assumption that families will have one primary caregiver, supported by a partner with few, or no, caregiving responsibilities. It\xe2\x80\x99s the old-fashioned homemaker/breadwinner model clothed in a tissue-thin veneer of gender neutrality.\nOut of 75 new and expanded leave policies profiled in a recent report by CLASP and the National Partnership for Women and Families, more than 34% required employees to attest that they were the primary caregiver for their child in order to obtain the maximum leave benefit. Several of the policies profiled throw even the pretense of gender neutrality out the window. One policy states expressly that pregnant women are assumed to be the primary caregiver. Another states that the maximum leave benefit is available only to birth mothers and primary caregivers in cases of adoption and surrogacy only (sorry, biological fathers!). A third puts its thumb on the scale more subtly by defining primary caregiver as the parent with primary-caregiver responsibility immediately after birth.\nEven a policy that looks neutral on paper can be applied in a manner that is anything but. Imagine this scenario: A new father tells his boss that he wants to designate himself as the baby\xe2\x80\x99s primary caregiver and take 12 weeks off. The boss is affronted: \xe2\x80\x9cI only took a few days off after my kids were born, and they turned out great. Twelve weeks is a long time \xe2\x80\x94 what will you do that whole time? Your wife will be home, won\xe2\x80\x99t she? We really need you at work right now!\xe2\x80\x9d Policies and practices like these are sex discrimination lawsuits waiting to happen.\nThe legal risks of primary-caregiver policies are not purely imaginative. JP Morgan Chase is currently under fire for its primary-caregiver policy, which the ACLU contends discriminates against fathers. JP Morgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s paid leave policy, which provides 16 paid weeks to primary caregivers and two weeks to secondary caregivers, is not unusual. Unequal leave policies for primary and secondary caregivers are widespread, a fact that has not escaped the ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s notice. To reduce legal risk, companies should eliminate primary-and secondary-caregiver categories from their leave policies.\nWhen it comes to leave for new parents, you need just two simple categories: disability leave for women who are physically unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and parental leave that\xe2\x80\x99s equally available to all employees, regardless of gender or caregiver status.\nLegal risk aside, primary-caregiver policies risk alienating the very workers they are designed to attract and retain: Millennials and women. Millennials, who will make up 75% of the American workforce within 10 years, place a high value on paid parental leave and workplace flexibility. Paid leave is not merely a women\xe2\x80\x99s issue for this generation: 78% of Millennials are part of a two-career couple, and it is the growing expectation of Millennial workers that both partners will work and parent. They find the homemaker/breadwinner model of family life unappealing, and so are likely to be put off by primary-caregiver policies. We know one Millennial, a systems engineer at a Fortune 500 company, who recently told her fianc\xc3\xa9, a fellow engineer, that they would not be having children until he committed to taking equal parental leave. Her fianc\xc3\xa9 admittedly had not thought that far ahead prior to their conversation, but is now fully on board with the plan. A leave policy that allows for just one primary caregiver could be a deal breaker for partnered Millennial employees who are committed to joint career advancement and equality at home.\nPrimary-caregiver policies are also counterproductive to employer efforts to recruit and retain women, who leave industries like tech at twice the rate of their male counterparts. Research shows that the more parental leave fathers take, the more likely mothers are to return to work full-time. Gender-neutral leave policies allow families to take parental leave equitably and are the better bet for employee retention.\nA recent report on paid family leave by the New America Foundation reports that women who take paid leave are far more likely to return to the workforce and work longer hours, on average, one to three years later. Companies that have expanded their paid leave offerings have seen the attrition of new mothers drop by as much as 50%. Forcing working women to accept the old-fashioned primary-caregiver role as a condition to taking leave, however, fuels family dynamics that ultimately hurt women \xe2\x80\x94 and their employers. Primary-caregiver policies pressure couples into breadwinner/homemaker roles instead of diving childcare responsibilities equally \xe2\x80\x94 the exact opposite of what employers should be doing to decrease attrition.\nPaid leave is a powerful tool for recruiting and retaining top talent \xe2\x80\x94 if it sends a strong signal that a company values its employees and is committed to equity and diversity in the workplace. Employers can avoid undercutting this powerful message by making sure that their paid leave policy applies equally to all new parents \xe2\x80\x94 mothers and fathers, biological and adoptive, LGBT, salaried and hourly \xe2\x80\x94 without requiring that employees first prove themselves to be primary caregivers. Many companies are ditching primary-caregiver policies in favor of gender-neutral policies and are expanding paid leave benefits to hourly workers, and for good reason: When you enter the paid-leave arms race, you want to win it.\n'

S'Prohibition is the desperate provincial politician\'s penultimate port of call. His last resort, of course, is the Bharatiya Janata Party. And so it was with Nitish Kumar. From being Indian secularism\'s homegrown mukhda, he became Hindutva\'s secular mukhota. Other people wear masks to look like Modi; Nitish devolved into Narendra while wearing his own face. I can see Amit Shah and the prime minister competing for the right to inhabit the shell of the neta-once-known-as-Nitish; however much you enjoy being the bearded heavy, the chance to hang out in virtuous, stubbly, secularist drag must be irresistible.\nWhere does it leave those of us who saw the electoral face-off between the BJP and the Mahagathbandhan in 2015 as the second battle of Buxar, only this time with a happy ending? In the original battle of 1764, an alien force, the East India Company, defeated three flawed desis, Shah Alam II, Shuja-ud-daula and Mir Qasim. In this contemporary replay, the result was reversed. The right side (or so we thought) won: that alien hydra, the sangh parivar, was routed by dodgy but human sons of the soil.\nLalu Prasad, we hoped, would be redeemed by Nitish\'s incorruptible seriousness. In return the political body odour that had rubbed off on Nitish after an age in the company of bigots would be deodorized by Lalu\'s thuggish but robustly inclusive company. At the time it didn\'t really matter who was on our side, so long as the all-conquering juggernaut was stopped. And it was. Briefly. Unluckily, our contemporary Mir Qasim turned out to be Mir Jafar in disguise. We know the historical Mir Jafar did well out of turning his coat: he died in office as the last Nawab of Bengal. It\'s what happened next that\'s worrying: aliens ruled us for the next two hundred years.\nThe mistake enthusiastic progressives made in 2015 was not in imagining that Nitish Kumar was committed to the secular cause; he was. Their mistake lay in not recognizing that Nitish\'s secular cause was himself. Say what you like about Narendra Modi, his cause is larger than he is. Hindutva defines him and he is happy to be so defined. In contrast, all of Nitish\'s causes are channels that irrigate his integrity: his personal incorruptibility is his political programme. Who is to say that isn\'t a secular project in a fervently corrupt country?\nIronically, this warrior licensed by Mandal has a classically brahminical obsessive compulsive disorder: a mania for cleansing. If Damien Hirst were commissioned to immortalize Nitish Kumar in one of his tank installations, he would have to suspend him in an antiseptic jelly. Prohibition, for example, was Nitish\'s way of purging Bihar of the devil drink. Cynical commentators described his support for demonetization as an early bid to make up to Modi after the 2015 election. There might be something to this but demonetization is also the sort of measure likely to enthuse Nitish Kumar.\nIn Nitish\'s mind, demonetizing the economy is like de-licensing drink: a necessary purging that\'ll magically cure the nation (no matter if it half-kills it first). It helps that he knows that the idea of public cleansing resonates with the electorate. In the public realm, it can be sold as an epic churning, as a samudra manthan. At the personal level, it\'s comprehensible as colonic irrigation. This is governance by enema and isabgol, high politics as purgatory.\nThis is why Nitish oscillates between the BJP and its enemies: sometimes he needs to purge himself of a communal taint, at other times he has to void himself of corruption. It depends on whose company he has been keeping because in Indian politics a good man must sleep rough. He would prefer to ally with honest secularists but there aren\'t any left because as pundits of every stripe will tell you, the Congress made corruption a secular cause. Who can blame Nitish, then, for choosing the honest bigot over the shady secularist? There\'s a sincerity to the lynch mob, a simple directness, that the corrupt and dissembling pluralist lacks.\nUnlike Modi and Shah, Nitish doesn\'t distrust Muslims. Nitish Kumar isn\'t Yogi Adityanath. He doesn\'t wear orange and his soul is socialist. He is, after all, one of the many ideological heirs of Ram Manohar Lohia, the great political geneticist who crossed Society with Sanctimony and bred an indigenous socialism. It\'s one of the great puzzles of Indian politics that ostentatiously ascetic Lohiaites - George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar - found their orbits around Hindutva\'s star, while Lohiaites with a more relaxed understanding of probity didn\'t.\nOn the 15th of May this year, newspapers quoted Nitish Kumar publicly ruling out any possibility of him heading a grand coalition against the BJP in the general elections of 2019. "Three years ago," he said, "who was aware that Modiji would be the Prime Minister of India? But it happened because he was capable of that and people of our country voted him to power. I know, I do not have that capacity. I am the leader of a small party and I have no national ambitions."\nWho knew, then, that he was re-applying for his position as chief minister by setting out the terms of his surrender? Still, even as we admire Nitish\'s brazen dexterity, that seamless vacation and re-occupation of the chief minister\'s chair, it\'s useful to understand that this time he didn\'t change horses midstream, he was bridled. The BJP settled into the saddle, spurs, whip and all, and the price of Bihar\'s pasture is that Nitish and his party will be ridden by feral cowboys.\nWhy did Nitish Kumar break with the BJP only to rejoin it, cap in hand? There\'s a clue in that May 15th statement: he didn\'t expect the BJP to get an absolute majority and thought, perhaps, that by winning a handful of Lok Sabha seats, he might hold the balance of power after the general elections. When neither came to pass and as the National Democratic Alliance won state after state after Modi\'s enthronement, he was forced into the arms of his old enemy, Lalu Prasad, to guard his turf against Shah\'s juggernaut. It was a famous victory but personally a pyrrhic one; the Rashtriya Janata Dal won more seats than the Janata Dal (United) did and he was lumbered with Lalu\'s son as deputy chief minister, a dauphin, who, sooner rather than later, would claim the top job.\nVery quickly the Mahagathbandhan\'s 2015 success became less a declaration of independence for Nitish and more a proof of his electoral viability, evidence that he had something to offer to a dominant national party like the BJP. There was still the remote alternative possibility that he might escape provincial politics and the spectre of Lalu by becoming the leader of an all-India Opposition, but that hope died with the BJP\'s bludgeoning triumph in UP. With 2019 seemingly a foregone conclusion, there was nothing to look forward to outside the NDA\'s fold, except grief from Lalu in 2020 when the next Bihar elections were due and a steady erosion of his brand, his reputation for fastidious honesty.\nSo he jumped ship because the BJP had demonstrated that Hindutva was high-octane electoral fuel. Cadre and voters were fired up by a hectoring nationalism in a way that they weren\'t by liberal ideas feebly mouthed by dilettantes and dynasts. For Nitish, this wasn\'t a communal choice; a small provincial party didn\'t have the luxury of choosing principle over the prevailing wind.\nGiven the state of Opposition politics, what price liberal excommunications and anathemas? Should Nitish feel the need, some years down the road, to flush the toxins of Hindutva out of his system, won\'t he just whistle up a motley bunch of progressives to welcome him home with little cries of joy, happy to be liberal props for another public bout of ritual cleansing? This is a reasonable question but the answer must be no.\nThis won\'t happen again, not mainly because progressives will have learnt their lesson and incubated a new, less opportunistic, politics but because Nitish Kumar has been branded and corralled. Politically, his nine lives are done; the nimbleness of the great survivor segues even as we watch into the shambling fealty of the undead. Those dark glasses will likely become a fixture now because anyone who gets to look into Nitish Kumar\'s eyes from here on will see Amit Shah looking out.\n'

S'Using Natural Ingredients For Skin Detoxification From Everyday Dirt & Dust'

S"Other than everyday cleansing, toning and moisturizing, the skin also needs detoxification. Detoxification is an additional beauty approach on the skin such that all its dirt and dust content is extracted and washed off.\nEvery day when we wash or clean our face and body, the topical layer of dirt and dust gets cleared. With skin detoxification, a deep cleaning is done that clears off the existing layers of pollutants on the skin cells and tissues.\nWe have listed a few recommended natural ingredients that you can use to do skin detoxification right at home.\n Use these natural ingredients to detoxify your skin every alternate week and in a month's time, you will see a big difference in the skin texture and complexion. Take a look.\nJojoba Oil\nTo detoxify your skin with jojoba oil, first, moisturize your skin with a spoon of jojoba oil. Wait for five minutes till the oil sets in your skin cells and pores. Use a neat cotton pad to wipe off the jojoba oil from your skin.\nCurd\nThe second ingredient in the list is curd which is very simple to get. You can use curd for skin detoxification on an everyday basis. Always use hung curd, and massage it all over your face and skin for at least 15 minutes and then wash off. Do not compromise on the amount of curd, as less of it will make it tough to massage all over.\nTomato and Sugar\nThe tomato and sugar work like a scrub for the skin that clears all clogged skin pores and cells. Cut half a tomato, take one slice and a bowl of granular sugar. Dab the sugar on the tomato and scrub your skin with this. On one hand, the tomato juice will moisturize and soften your skin and on the other, the sugar will exfoliate.\nSugar and Lemon\nAmong the natural detoxifiers of the skin, another scrub recipe is sugar and lemon. Squeeze lemon juice first in a bowl. Add granular sugar to it such that both are consistently mixed. Now using your hands, scrub it especially on the blackheads and whiteheads. Please note, do not scrub on the skin with pimples, acne or rash.\nYeast and Lemon\nThis is a skin detoxifying pack in which you have to combine two ingredients - yeast and lemon. In a tablespoon of yeast, mix three to five tablespoons of lemon juice. Apply and wait for it to dry and then wash off using lukewarm water. You will instantly see the detoxification result on your skin.\nBasil Toner\nIn the skin detoxification process, you can also use a toner. The good part about toner is, after preparing, these can be preserved in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Coming to basil toner, the preparation is very simple, you have to blend fresh basil leaves in the blender and then, use a strainer to collect the fresh toner. For complete skin detoxification, soak a cotton pad in the basil toner and then, massage it all over your skin and face.\nCucumber Toner\nFor this one blend cucumber pieces, strain and collect the toner. This can also be preserved in the refrigerator. The best part about cucumber toner is, it has versatile uses, that is, the same can be applied on the under-eye area to remove dark skin as well. Spraying cucumber toner every day before makeup also acts as a light primer. So, once you make the cucumber toner, there is no way you can waste it.\nAlmond, Sugar, Cream And Olive Oil\nIn this skin detoxifier, you will require two kinds of sugar - white and brown in the same ratio. To the sugar mix, add crushed almond and mix the three ingredients. Lastly, make it into a paste by adding some olive oil to it. This cannot be preserved for future use and should be used as fresh as possible. Also, after massaging this on the skin, allow it dry for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n"

S'A chemical in the Saturn\'s largest moon, Titan, has been discovered by NASA scientists. The chemical is capable of forming stable, flexible structures similar to cell membranes even under the harsh conditions.\n Acrylonitrile, also known as vinyl cyanide, is a chemical found on Earth which is useful for manufacturing plastics.\n Chemical fingerprint of acrylonitrile in Titan data collected by the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile was identified by the NASA researchers.\nLarge quantities of chemical were found by researchers on Titan, most likely in the stratosphere, which is the hazy part of the amosphere. the moon gets its brownish-orange colour from the stratosphere.\n"We found convincing evidence that acrylonitrile is present in Titan\'s atmosphere, and we think a significant supply of this raw material reaches the surface," said Maureen Palmer, researcher at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n Earth\'s plants and animals\' cells would not hold up well on Titan because of surface temperatures average minus -179 degrees Celsius and lakes filled with liquid methane.\nAcrylonitrile molecules could come together as a sheet of material similar to a cell membrane.\n "The ability to form a stable membrane to separate the internal environment from the external one is important because it provides a means to contain chemicals long enough to allow them to interact," said Michael Mumma, director of the Goddard Center for Astrobiology.\n "If membrane-like structures could be formed by vinyl cyanide, it would be an important step on the pathway to life on Saturn\'s moon Titan," he added in a paper published in the journal Science Advances.\nSaturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.\nFirst Published: Sunday, Jul 30, 2017 10:39 PM\n'

S'India has cautioned against the use of terrorism as a \xe2\x80\x9ccard\xe2\x80\x9d by some nations, underlining that it is an international threat that should not be allowed to serve national strategy.\nIndia\xe2\x80\x99s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, addressing a General Assembly session on UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, said while nations deal with the threats posed by terrorism, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must resist the temptation of buying individual peace for ourselves by striking deals that divert terrorists elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to intensify our efforts in persuading states to refrain from using terrorism as a card in the games that nations play. While non-state actors such as terrorists think global, we representatives of States alas, are thinking only nationally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said yesterday.\nMr Akbaruddin also warned against the dangers of discrimination among terrorists \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cgood or bad or yours and mine,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasising that terrorism is an international threat that should not be allowed to serve national strategy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to move beyond discouraging state sponsorship of terrorism and take the next step of building effective inter-state cooperative mechanisms to combat it. If cooperation is to thrive, Inter-Governmental organisations such as the UN need to be strengthened to deal with the substance of these threats,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nMr Akbaruddin added that the list of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s collective limitations in dealing with the threats posed by terrorists is too long and self-evident to be recalled in its entirety.\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagination and integration remain two of our major shortcomings as individual nations and collectively as the United Nations. These have caused much distress at crucial times.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe stressed on the need for \xe2\x80\x9chonest introspection\xe2\x80\x9d to pressing concerns such as from where do the terrorists get their training and financing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile addressing our limitations, we must do an honest introspection. There are important issues today before the international community that beg answers. Where do potential terrorists go for training? How does their financing work? What are we doing to disrupt the eco-systems that promote terror startups? Do we know the answers and yet choose to look away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nIndia also voiced concern over the international community\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to terrorism in some geographies being different from others. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are currently witnessing the impact of the Middle East on Europe, a development that was waiting to happen and yet not anticipated! In South Asia, we are witnessing the international community\xe2\x80\x99s efforts of combating terrorism being affected by a fatigue of a long-drawn war in Afghanistan,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\nMr Akbaruddin described nuclear terrorism, radiological terrorism and cyber terrorism as \xe2\x80\x9capocalyptic threats\xe2\x80\x9d that have emerged as \xe2\x80\x9cruthless\xe2\x80\x9d non-state actors evolve their ideology and adapt strategies to strike deeper roots and explore different avenues to threaten innocent populations of established States.\nHe reiterated the need for an early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, saying it will reflect the unwavering common commitment to cooperate in combating terrorism.\nHe expressed hope that the creation of the Office of Counter Terrorism will encourage an \xe2\x80\x98all of UN\xe2\x80\x99 approach while addressing the scourge of terrorism.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that some aspects of this approach may appear overly ambitious given the turf battles common at such fora. However, we must not set ourselves a low bar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n'

S"Staff Reporter,\nTROPICAL NEUROLOGY WEEK\nFour cases of Zika Virus infection have been reported in the country so far, the Government informed the RajyaSabha on July 25 this year. Three laboratory confirmed cases, including that of a pregnant woman, were reported from Bapunagar area of Ahmedabad district in Gujarat. The fourth case was from Krishnagiri district of Tamilnadu. But Indians should not feel panic, they have to be careful.\nWorld Health Organisation on February 1, 2016 has declared Zika virus as Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC. The illness itself is mild and by and large does not need major medical intervention. However, the neurological consequences are devastating, informs Dr Raad Shakir, President of World Federation of Neurology. \n'\nThe biggest danger from the Zika virus is to pregnant women and their foetuses. Zika infections in pregnant women can lead to congenital defects in their newborns such as microcephaly, in which the brain of the infant is small and underdeveloped. Long term disabilities with convulsions associated with severe psychomotor retardation are the expected consequences. These children will need lifelong neurological care. In addition to microcephaly, other neurological complications like Hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcification and other clinical and radiological brain anomalies are also seen, mentioned Dr Amilton Barreira, Professor of Neurology, Sao Paulo University, Brazil and Secretary General of Tropical Neurology Group of World Federation of Neurology. Brazil was worst hit during the recent epidemic with report of 1.7 lakh cases. About 3500 children born to Zika positive mothers were observed to have microcephaly in Brazil within span of 4 months from October 2015 to January 2016.\nZika is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a day time active AedesAegypti mosquito , and can also be sexually transmitted by men to their sexual partners. Dengue, Chikungunya and Japanese Encephalitis have created havoc in the country in recent years. Zika virus is also from same Flavivirus group and transmitted by same mosquito.\nThe virus was first isolated in1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda, near lake victoria. In 2014 the virus spread eastward across the Pacific Ocean to French Polynesia, then to Easter Iland and in 2015 to Mexico, Central America,the Caribbean,and South America, where Zika outbreak has reached pandemic levels. Those infected with the virus may have mild fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain or headache. The illness is usually mild and the symptoms normally last for 2-7 days. 80 % people infected with virus do not have any complaints.\nZika infections have also been linked to increased incidences of Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 syndrome, a nervous system disordercausing weakness in limbs. Some patients also have difficulty in breathing and swallowing . 25 % patients require support of ventilator to tide over acute illness and can die if they don't get proper treatment.. The treatment of the condition is use of IV Immunoglobulin or Plasma exchange. This treatment is very costly and therefore national governments,WHO, the UN ,and other aid agencies should coordinate to support patients in resource limited poor and developing countries, mentions Dr Raad Shakir.\nCurrently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine against this virus. Hence, prevention is key with control of mosquito populations and prevention of mosquito bites says Dr. Chandrashekhar Meshram, President of Tropical Neurology Group of World Federation of Neurology.\n"

S' A new NASA app will allow folks across the United States to become citizen scientists and collect data for an interactive map.\n The NASA-sponsored Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program launched the app to allow enthusiastic spectators to document their solar eclipse observations wherever they may be along path of the Aug. 21 total eclipse.\n This nationwide citizen-science experiment is easy to become a part of, and, as highlighted in the new GLOBE Observer (NASA GO) Eclipse App instructional video, requires you to have only a smartphone and a thermometer as you experience a partial or total eclipse. [The Best ISO-Certified Gear to See the 2017 Solar Eclipse]\n "When the Earth goes dark for a few minutes during a total solar eclipse, animals, plants and environmental conditions react. In the path of the eclipse, temperatures and clouds can change quickly," said the NASA video\'s narrator. \nA still from a new NASA video describing how a participant can use the free Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) smartphone app to record local temperatures, which drop during a total or partial solar eclipse.\n Since all of North America will experience at least a partial eclipse on Aug. 21, NASA encourages everyone to get involved in scientific observations during this rare experience.\n "No matter where you are in North America, whether it\'s cloudy, clear or rainy, NASA wants as many people to help with this citizen science project," Kristen Weaver, deputy coordinator for the project, said in a statement.\n NASA will certainly benefit from the plethora of data it is hoping to receive from citizen scientists across the continent. However, this initiative is also a way for NASA to inspire concern and participation in an international scientific endeavor, according to GLOBE. The idea is to democratize scientific observation by helping observers to understand their surroundings and to excite folks about what they are capable of.\n By mobilizing people to empirically analyze the world around them on Aug. 21, Weaver said, "We want to inspire a million eclipse viewers to become eclipse scientists."\n Once participants download the free GLOBE Observer app and register themselves, the app will guide them to record their observations. The information is then placed by the app onto an interactive map that people can view to see how individual contributions have added to the collective project.\nA still from a new video for the free NASA GLOBAL Observer app. The continental United States, as well as Canada and Mexico, will experience a partial or total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. Observers within all ranges of the eclipse path are invited to measure temperatures in their vicinity and then upload the information to the new NASA GLOBE Observer (NASA GO) app.\n Editor\'s note: Space.com has teamed up with Simulation Curriculum to offer this awesome Eclipse Safari app to help you enjoy your eclipse experience. The free app is available for Apple and Android, and you can view it on the web. \n'

S'Salmonella 101: What you need to know\n (CNN)Twenty-four people in 16 states were infected with a strain of salmonella from March through June in an outbreak linked to microbiology laboratories, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday. Six people were hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.\nThe CDC released an investigation notice about the outbreak of the Salmonella typhimurium strain, which was also linked to infections in microbiology labs in 2011 and 2014. \nThe infections occurred in clinical, commercial, college and university microbiology laboratories in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington. Those affected ranged in age from less than a year to 57 years old.\nSalmonella bacteria can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Though most people recover without treatment, severe cases can require antibiotics or hospitalization. Those with impaired immune systems, as well as the elderly and infants, are at greater risk of severe illness from a salmonella infection. The CDC estimates that 380 people die and a million become ill from salmonella each year.\nIn response to previous lab-related outbreaks, the CDC released a set of guidelines for students, employees and faculty members to use when working in microbiology laboratories. It includes not bringing home items used in the lab; following proper biosafety training; wearing gloves, a lab coat or other protective garments; actively washing hands; and avoiding touching your face or body while in the lab.\nSeveral people infected in the latest outbreak reported risky behaviors, such as not wearing gloves, not washing hands and using writing utensils or notebooks outside the laboratory. \nJoin the conversation\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\nThose working in laboratories should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of salmonella infection and see a health care provider if they believe they may be infected, the CDC says. It is also important to note that not only laboratory workers can get sick; people who live with them are also vulnerable.\n'

Taiwan's weather bureau warned of torrential rain in the eastern and southern counties, with the tropical storm expected to dump as much as 900 millimetres of water in some areas.\nSchools and work were cancelled for two outlying islands, while several eastern counties were expected to follow suit in the afternoon. Most trains running along the east coast were also suspended today. Air travel was disrupted, with domestic flights to the east coast and outlying islands cancelled.\nMore than 36,000 soldiers are on standby to help with disaster relief.\nAlthough Nesat is Taiwan's first typhoon this year, the island was pounded by heavy rains last month. At least one person died in June floods in the north of the country, after 600 millimetres of rain fell in under 11 hours in some areas.\nTaiwan's government has stepped up preventive measures against tropical storms since typhoon Morakot left more than 400 people dead in its wake in 2009.\n"

S'How to Make Pound Cake Without a Recipe'

S'http://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/how-to-make-pound-cake-without-recipe-article'
p1001

S'All you need is a kitchen scale, a simple ratio, and the willingness to let go of tyrannical recipes (for at least an hour or two).\nIn that completely confident way that only small children can achieve, I once thought that pound cake got its name from the fact that it was the heaviest kind of cake to carry. That, of course, is not that case.\nA slice of pound cake indeed weigh more i\nn the hand than a slice of, say, genoise. But I now know that pound cake gets it name from the ratio of its ingredients: one pound butter, one pound sugar, one pound flour, one pound eggs.\nAnd I also know that, actually, the ingredients need not be in pounds. As long as everything is equal parts by weight, you\'ll still get that wonderfully dense, buttery, not-too-sweet cake. That\'s why in France they call it a "quatre quarts" (four-fourths) cake.\nThe ratio and the technique for how to make pound cake are easy to remember. Two tools make it actually possible: a scale and an electric mixer. You can\'t make pound cake without a recipe without a scale, but that scale and the bowl of your stand mixer (or the one bowl you\'ll use with your handheld mixer) are almost the only things you\'ll need to wash. It doesn\'t have to be a fancy digital scale\xe2\x80\x94any kitchen scale will do\xe2\x80\x94and if you don\'t already have a scale in your kitchen it\'s a worthwhile investment for so many reasons, baking sans recipe included.\n1. Figure Out How Much Cake to Make\nSo you know you have to have equal weight of each ingredient, but how much should you start with? Good question. First off, too much cake is never a bad thing, and pound cake freezes well, so don\'t worry too much about making too much cake. Starting with a half pound of each ingredient will feed 8, while a pound will get you to at least 14 servings. That half pound size fits well in a 9-inch loaf pan or an 8-inch round. Or you can mix together however much pound cake batter you want, and then figure out what size cake pan (or two!) it\'ll fit in. If you want to get scientific, a volume chart might help.\nHowever much you\'re using, make sure your eggs and your butter are at room temperature before you begin mixing.\n    Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Anna Stockwell  \n1/2 pound of butter and 1/2 pound of sugar ready to go. Now all we need are some eggs, flour, cardamom, vanilla, and sliced plums.\n2. Cream Together Equal Parts Butter and Sugar\nThis is where that electric mixer really shows its worth. Start with room temperature butter and beat it with the mixer until smooth. Now add an equal weight of sugar, and beat it on high until the mixture is pale and fluffy, 5 minutes or more. The mixture gets paler and fluffier as more air bubbles are beaten into it, which will act as the leavening for your pound cake. So don\'t skimp on this step if you want your cake to rise.\nNote: You don\'t actually have to use butter here if you don\'t want to. You can use a mixture of butter and oil, or you can use all oil. Olive oil is lovely if you want your cake to taste like olive oil; ditto coconut oil. Measure your oil by weight just as you would your butter, but know that using oil instead of butter will mean that you\'re giving up that classic pound cake butter flavor.\n3. Gradually Mix In Equal Part Eggs\nHow do you measure eggs by weight? Not in their shell. Set a bowl on your scale, tare it, and then crack eggs into the bowl until you get a weight that matches the weight you\'re building your ratio off of. If one more egg sets you over the weight limit, whisk it all together and remove and discard beaten egg until you reach the target weight.\nTurn your mixer on to low, and gradually add the eggs, one or two at a time, beating throughly after each addition.\n4. Add Some Flavor\nOnce all the eggs are incorporated you can add any flavoring elements to the batter you like. A splash of vanilla is classic, or you could go for almond extract instead. Add a pinch of salt no matter what, then perhaps a pinch of one or two of your favorite baking spices. I love cardamom in pound cake. Any citrus zest can work too, as well as citrus juice. Or try a splash of brandy or amaretto. Or go for instant coffee powder.\nGive it another beating, then have a taste and see what you think. Mix in more flavoring if you think it needs more.\n    Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Anna Stockwell  \nHere\'s how to make pound cake with olive oil instead of butter. We added lemon zest and juice added for flavor and poppy seeds mixed in at the end.\n5. Stir In an Equal Part Flour\nOnce you start adding the flour you don\'t want to do too much mixing, so it\'s important to get all that flavor tinkering done with before you add the flour. Gradually stir in the flour on the lowest possible setting of your mixer just until it\'s incorporated.\n6. Add Mix-Ins, If You Like\nBefore you transfer your batter to your cake pan, you have the option to fold some things into it if you want, like some chopped fruit or nuts or seeds or chocolate chips. I love sliced plums in a vanilla-cardamom pound cake and chocolate chips in a coffee pound cake. My lemon-olive oil pound cake is even better with poppy seeds in it. But you don\'t have to add any mix-ins if you don\'t want to!\n7. Bake the Pound Cake\nGrease your cake pan generously with butter, then dump your batter into it and smooth the top.\nBake your cake in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, which will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending on the size of your cake. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool before turning the cake out.\nThe one on the right is coffee-flavored and drizzled with melted chocolate, while that plum-studded cardamom-flavored number is simply finished with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.\n8. Top and Serve the Cake\nYou don\'t need to top a pound cake\xe2\x80\x94but you can! Make a syrup (maybe with some booze in it?) and pour it all over the cake to make it damper and sweeter. Or go with a classic powdered sugar glaze. Or drizzle straight up melted chocolate all over the place. Or keep things simple with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, a pile of fresh berries, and/or some whipped cream. The hefty pound cake can take it all.\n'

Rs 5,000 in cash were taken from the safe. \n When the started moving down to the first floor in search of more valuables, inmates raised an alarm. The burglars aborted their bid and fled the spot with the booty. \n  Based on a complaint of the retired railway staff Hari Krishnan, 62, the Ayanavaram police registered a case and launched a hunt for the suspects. Hari Krishnan stayed at one of the rooms on the first floor, while his mother Annammal, 92, continued to stay on the third floor after the demise of her husband Ramasamy a decade ago. \n  During inquiry, Hari Krishnan told police that the two burglars were wearing masks to cover up their faces. Police suspected that the burglars may have known to the family and that was the reason, they have used masks. Police personnel have collected CCTV footages from some of the nearby apartments and shops to trace the suspects. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S"A police officer controls the traffic in front of a tree uprooted by strong winds caused by Typhoon Nesat in Taipei, Taiwan on July 30, 2017. (AP Photo)\n TAIPEI (Taiwan): Taiwan's first typhoon of the year left 81 people injured and coastal towns flooded as the island braced for a second tropical storm on Sunday. \n Howling winds toppled motor scooters and hit people with flying glass, the Central Emergency Operations Center said. In Yilan county on the northeast coast, one person was blown down, another was struck by a wind-driven object and a third was injured when a utility truck flipped. \n  Typhoon Nesat made landfall on the northeast coast of Taiwan Saturday evening with maximum sustained winds of 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 173kph (107 mph), according to the national weather bureau. \n All but two of the injuries were light, an operations center staff person said. \n The typhoon also left shops and streets in agricultural Pingtung county knee deep in muddy water after dumping about 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) of rain. \n More than 10,000 people, largely from Taiwan's south, were evacuated before the typhoon and 1,612 were still in shelters Sunday morning. \n Nesat caused the cancellation of 145 international flights and cut power to nearly half a million households. \n The typhoon passed through Taiwan and reached Fujian province in southeastern China by 7am Sunday as a less severe tropical storm, officials said. \n Close to 70,000 people have been evacuated so far and dozens of trains and flights suspended in Fuzhou, the provincial capital, Fujian's water resources department said. \n Taiwan, meanwhile, is on alert again as a second tropical storm was due to make landfall Sunday night. \n Taiwan, China, Japan and the Philippines regularly see typhoons from June through November. The deadliest in Taiwan since 2000 was Typhoon Morakot, which set off landslides that left about 680 people dead in 2009. \n"

S'xegxef / Pixabay\nNo longer just a trend, influencer marketing campaigns are now an essential part of overall marketing strategies for many companies and brands.\nEven if you\xe2\x80\x99re not familiar with the specifics of influencer marketing, you\xe2\x80\x99ve most likely been a consumer of influencer marketing campaigns. Ever liked an Instagram post from your favorite blogger or social media celeb with an #ad or #spon hashtag? If so, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the power of influencer marketing, a strategy through which brands and companies leverage the existing relationships that influencers have with their engaged, captive followings. Influencers typically are paid a fee for their endorsement, which is embedded within their non-sponsored content.\nAs influencer marketing becomes ubiquitous, however, another realization has crystallized: it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to identify and pay influencers for single-post campaigns on just one platform. Not all influencers are created equal, and the best way to ensure successful campaigns is to develop relationships with both paid and organic partners who can employ a multi-platform approach, all while using influencer strategies to augment your own internal multi-channel campaigns.\nCoordinating influencer campaigns can be time-consuming, and the campaigns themselves can be costly, depending on the fees you pay to partners. Here are three ways to ensure that your influencer marketing strategies pay off.\nIdentify influencers who connect with your brand\xe2\x80\x99s core values and who will engage on multiple platforms multiple times.\nVetting your influencers is a hugely important part of any campaign, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a numbers game. Sure, you can look at a potential influencer\xe2\x80\x99s number of followers to get an idea of their social media presence and clout, but your analysis should go beyond that. Influencers who have a natural affinity with your brand and its core values can create more compelling content than someone with a million or more followers but less personal interest in the product. Similarly, as studies have shown that potential consumers often only convert to traffic or customers after seeing a product multiple times, you want to identify whether influencers are meaningfully engaged with followers on multiple platforms. Can they create content that\xe2\x80\x99s authentic and more than just a one-off? Before you sign paid contracts for influencers, make sure they are skillfully creating content on multiple channels, and that your brand\xe2\x80\x99s values sync with theirs.\n Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to utilize organic influencer marketing in addition to paid influencer marketing.\nYour brand might get the most exposure, numerically speaking, from a celebrity that has a large social following, but partnering with an ambassador can be even more beneficial for your brand and a lot friendlier to your budget. Ambassadors are in it for the perks and their love of the brand, not the pay, which means that their content can really capture the heart and soul of your product and company. Additionally, an influencer program that relies on ambassadors is a great way to integrate a specialized referral program. By providing an avenue for content created by your brand\xe2\x80\x99s biggest fans, you build a well-oiled marketing machine that runs on dedication and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require the same level of vetting as other types of influencer marketing.\n Recommended for You \n Use influencer campaigns to bolster traditional multi-channel marketing.\nAccording to a recent survey, 78 percent of marketers queried said that determining return-on-investment for influencer campaigns will be a top challenge in 2017. While influencer marketing has eclipsed its trendy beginnings, it\xe2\x80\x99s still no replacement for integrated campaigns that drive brand awareness, website traffic, and product sales. Internal marketing campaigns are easier to measure and analyze, and consumers expect reputable brands to have a considerable online presence of their own. Influencers can enhance marketing and diversify a brand\xe2\x80\x99s target audience, but companies should use influencer campaigns to elevate their existing marketing, not rely on influencers exclusively.\nInfluencer Marketing is a Powerful Tool\nInfluencer marketing presents unique challenges and opportunities for brands. By cultivating a network of engaged influencers and ambassadors who can support your existing marketing campaigns, you position your brand for success in today\xe2\x80\x99s influencer-driven marketplace.\n'

S'Thiruvananthapuram,(IANS) The Kerala unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has called for a statewide shutdown on Sunday in protest against the killing of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activist allegedly by Communist Party of India (CPI-M) loyalists.\nThe 34-year-old RSS worker, who was hacked on Saturday night in the state capital, breathed his last at a private hospital. The deceased has been identified as E. Rajesh, who was a \xe2\x80\x9cKaryavahak\xe2\x80\x9d attached to the RSS unit at Sreekariyam near here.\nState BJP President Kummanem Rajasekheran, who visited the hospital, told reporters that this was a result of state-sponsored violence.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe CPI-M led government has become a mute witness to the violence going on in the state capital district. Even our state party headquarters was attacked. But we exercised restraint.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now, we are left with no other option but to call for a statewide shutdown tomorrow (Sunday) to protest the killing (of Rajesh). The state government has not even called for a peace talk to resolve issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Rajasekheran said.\nAccording to the BJP, Rajesh was hacked by four suspected youth wing activists of the CPI-M people, who came on two motorcycles.\nHe suffered serious injuries in his face, hands and legs, and according to the BJP, his left hand was severed and thrown away.\nThe killing comes a day after a group of CPI-M workers led by local Councillor I.P. Binu smashed six vehicles parked in the state committee office of the BJP.\nAfter the attack at the BJP headquarters, the residence of the son of CPI-M state Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was stoned.\nFor the past two weeks, an uneasy calm has been prevailing in the capital district, with the activists of the BJP and the CPI-M attacking each other every now and then.\nThiruvananthapuram district CPI-M Secretary Anavoor Nagappan in a statement issued here on Saturday night said that the CPI-M had no role in this incident.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were some local issues in the area and in this incident, the CPI-M has no role,\xe2\x80\x9d Nagappan\xe2\x80\x99s statement read.\n'

S' THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With reports of plans being made to launch the Mizoram state lottery in Kerala without the consent of the state government, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac has asked the police and tax officials to confiscate the lotteries if they are being sold in the state. \n Terming it as illegal and in violation of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, Isaac warned that Kerala state lottery agents found selling such lotteries will lose their registration. \n  Central government rules mandate that if lotteries from another state in introduced in Kerala, the government of that state will have to inform the Kerala government in writing. Also, such lotteries can be sold in Kerala only as per the directions under the Act, he said. \n "The Mizoram government hasn\'t informed us about the plan. It is learnt that Santiago Martin is behind the move and the Mizoram government is not involved," said Isaac. \n A lottery cannot be sold offering a prize money of 53% of the total sales, and that too after paying 28% tax. Hence, the Mizoram lottery should be seen as a fraud and their aim is to either not pay the tax or not to give away the prizes. This was the method they adopted last time they came into the state, he said. \n "The state government cannot ban other state lotteries. But the Centre has promised us to take action if such lotteries are being sold without following rules. Hence, it has been decided to write to the Mizoram government first and to the Centre later, informing about the violations," he added. \n As per the Act, the government of the state selling lotteries in another state (in this case, Kerala) should inform the host state about the marketing arrangements being made and provide details of the persons or firms involved in selling, distribution and printing of such lotteries. \n These should be physically verified by the officials of both the governments. \n The details of the unsold lotteries should also be provided. Also, the entire proceeds of the sale by the distributors or agents should first be credited to the treasury account of the organizing state government. \n "It is clear that the intention in this case is to cheat people. Hence, the police have been told to nab those found selling the illegal lotteries," said Isaac. \n'

(Twitter) \nIndu Sarkar, the movie which was released this Friday, caught in the CBFC war. Besides facing the CBFC blows, the film had also welcomed the wrath of the Congress party who protested against the release of the film. The film was released amidst controversies and besides being in the limelight since the release of its trailer the film opened with only 5% occupancy rate. The movie which is based on India during emergency had a lot of expectations surrounding it but given the mixed reviews it has received, the film has quite not stood upto the expectation of the people.\nMadhur Bhandarkar, who made movies like Page 3 and Fashion could not exactly deliver what he was expected to. The quite lost its essence to the fact that it compelled its viewers to believe that the whole idea is fictitious. People who went with the expectation of reliving the horrors of the emergency were disappointed to find the meat skinned to an extent that no meat was left to it. Besides a decent performance by the cast and a commendable job by Kirti Kulhari as Indu Sarkar, the film fails to hold it together.\nWatching premier of #InduSarkar.

S' Kolkata: Three more flood-related deaths were reported in West Bengal, taking the toll to 31, even as Indian Air Force helicopters dropped food and medicines in marooned areas and rescued nine people in West Midnapore district. \n Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the situation had improved but could worsen again if more water was released from the dams.\n "Three more persons have died in the last 24 hours. The toll since July 21 (when the heavy rains started) is 31," a state government official said but did not give the details as to where and how the fatalities occurred.\n Around 2,067 relief camps were opened in the 11 flood-hit districts where 165 villages spread across 104 blocks had been inundated due to heavy monsoon rains and release of water from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dams since last weekend.\n "The (flood) situation has got better but the problem will again rise if more water is released. The quantum of water released was more than the amount during the 1978 floods," Banerjee said while leaving the state secretariat Nabanna.\n Asked about the stranded people in Pratappur village of West Midnapore district\'s Ghatal block, she said: "Many persons were rescued from Ghatal and we are trying."\n A Defence Ministry spokesperson said nine people, including three women and five children, were rescued from the area by air force helicopters that took off from the Barrackpore air base.\n "Nine persons were winched up and food and medicines dropped," the spokesperson said.\n The state government official said the situation had improved in the affected districts due to the rainfall receding and the DVC releasing less water.\n Meanwhile, the DVC withdrew the yellow flood warning message for Panchet dam in neighbouring Jharkhand.\n'

S'The Italian says reports a deal has been agreed with the Premier League champions for the Nerazzurri winger are false\nReports Antonio Candreva is set to join Chelsea are "absolutely not" true, says Inter head coach Luciano Spalletti.\nCandreva started as Inter claimed the International Champions Cup title in Singapore with a 2-1 win against Chelsea, thanks to Stevan Jovetic and Ivan Perisic goals.\nThe Italy international has been linked with a switch to the Premier League champions after a single season at San Siro, but Spalletti insisted no deal has been done.\n"Absolutely not," Spalletti said when asked if Candreva was set to join Chelsea. "A lot of things have happened during the summer but we intend to keep Candreva.\n"If we have to sell him it will be difficult because we are short of wingers. We will need to discuss it internally before making any decisions."\nPerisic has also been the subject of strong transfer speculation, with Manchester United reportedly at the front of the queue for the Croatia international.\nThe midfielder hit 11 Serie A goals last season but Spalletti highlighted that Inter still only finished seventh in the Serie A table despite his excellent contribution.\n"The last year Perisic played with Inter he was important to the team," Spalletti said. "But with Perisic we did not win anything. It is important the team wins, not one individual."\nVictory over Chelsea made it three ICC wins out of three for Inter and Spalletti was satisfied with his side\'s preparations for the new campaign.\n"It\'s difficult for the team and playing against Chelsea and Bayern is not easy," the Italian said. "We had some anxiety, but the response was good, with attacking and defending. I\'m impressed with the performance of the team.\n"On the positive side I was surprised by our professionalism. Last season was difficult with concentration issues but we have made a lot of progress. I must also say there were careless mistakes in the last half an hour of the game.\n"The reason could also be that we have played five games in the last two weeks, the last one two days ago, so there are different reasons for the team\'s lack of attention after 60 minutes. Overall I am happy and we are working in the right direction.\n"We played very well until 60 minutes then Chelsea started attacking more. We made some minor mistakes but I\'m pleased with the performance of the team."\n'

S'From Satyavati and Shikhandi to Menaka and Surpanakha, lesser-known characters of India\xe2\x80\x99s ancient texts are being brought out of the shadows today by authors who are reinterpreting their stories in imaginative ways\n  Published by HarperCollins, the book is the first in a series of 12 books called Girls of Mahabharata, with each book retelling stories of different women from the epic. \nSmitha Verma\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a book that you would immediately associate with Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan. The young author, who shot to fame with her blog, The Compulsive Confessor, is known for books that are far removed from mythology. So her latest, The One who Swam with the Fishes, which released in June, came as a surprise to many. The book reimagines the life of Satyavati, the queen of Shantanu, the Kuru king of Hastinapur, and mother of Mahabharata\xe2\x80\x99s author Vyasa. With this book, Madhavan has joined the long list of writers who have succumbed to the latest trend of writing about lesser-known characters from India\xe2\x80\x99s ancient texts. Talking about her decision to turn to mythology for her new book, Madhavan says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been always interested in writing about strong female characters. Having written five books already on different subjects, I thought of exploring mythology this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPublished by HarperCollins, the book is the first in a series of 12 books called Girls of Mahabharata, with each book retelling stories of different women from the epic. In her next, The One who had Two Lives, Madhavan will focus on Shikhandi, narrating the tale of the transgender who played a significant role in the Mahabharata.Mythological fiction is nothing new in India. Over the years, many writers have explored and made a success of the genre\xe2\x80\x94one of the earliest trendsetters was, in fact, Ashok Banker, who wrote a reimagined series of eight books on the Ramayana in 2003. But soon, the market met its saturation and a need was felt to bring in something new. What followed was writers picking and focusing on the fringe characters of India\xe2\x80\x99s ancient epics, reimagining their stories like never before.\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Madhavan. Many other writers are picking up characters who may not have gotten their due in the ancient texts. Writer Kavita Kane, for instance, created ripples in 2013 with her debut book, Karna\xe2\x80\x99s Wife: The Outcast Queen, which told the story of Karna through the eyes of his wife Uruvi. Last year, Kane came out with Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Princess, the story of Surpanakha, Ravan\xe2\x80\x99s infamous sister. Kane\xe2\x80\x99s other books in the genre include Menaka\xe2\x80\x99s Choice (about the apsara Menaka) and Sita\xe2\x80\x99s Sister (about Urmila, Sita\xe2\x80\x99s sister and the neglected wife of Lakshman). Talking about her debut book, Kane says, \xe2\x80\x9cKarna is the classic tragic hero, but I was more keen to tell his story through the eyes of his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d The book is in its 14th edition now, with a Marathi translation expected soon.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetelling from mythology is not new. Kalidas\xe2\x80\x99 Shakuntala is very different from the original Shakuntala by Vyasa. It\xe2\x80\x99s the different perspective that changes the narrative, even though the plot remains the same.\xe2\x80\x9d Kane explains. Talking about her next literary venture, the author says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t divulge the name of my next book yet, but it\xe2\x80\x99s on an intriguing lady from the Mahabharata.\xe2\x80\x9d There are many more in the offing. Penguin Random House is coming up with Vyasa by Sankha Banerjee and Sibaji Bandyopadhyay. Rupa Publications has lined up Ravana-Leela by Radha Viswanath, while HarperCollins will come out with Sharath Komarraju\xe2\x80\x99s Queens of Hastinapur later this year. Komarraju\xe2\x80\x99s second title in the Hastinapur series, Rise of Hastinapur, came out early this year. In the recent past, there have been books like Vamsee Juluri\xe2\x80\x99s The Kishkindha Chronicles. The trilogy from Westland chronicles the life of Hanuman and his people. The first book of the trilogy, Saraswati\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligence, was published in January. Apart from Westland, another publishing house that is working extensively in the genre is Rupa Publications, which has titles like Kamadeva: The God of Desire, Shakti: The Divine Feminine (both by Anuja Chandramouli), Tunnel of Varanavat (about a Kuru warrior from the Mahabharata, written by Gautam Chikermane) and The Curse of Brahma (by Jagmohan Bhanver).\nElaborating on the reasons for the popularity of the genre, Madhavan says, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are getting more and more curious about their history, culture and mythology. This generation is interested in reading about what happened many centuries back,\xe2\x80\x9d says the 35-year-old author, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are stories that have a good mix of fantasy along with a strong storyline, which appeals to younger readers.\xe2\x80\x9d Madhavan has a point. Mythology is everywhere today, be it movies, television, computer games, visual arts, traditional literature or graphic novels. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a new generation of readers that\xe2\x80\x99s keen on mythological fiction that is far removed from contemporary reality, which makes it fascinating,\xe2\x80\x9d says Thomas Abraham, managing editor, Hachette India, adding that their bestseller is Krishna Udayasankar\xe2\x80\x99s The Aryavarta Chronicles, a reimagining of Krishna\xe2\x80\x99s story, the first book of which sold 30,000 copies. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing about mythology is that there are so many ancillary characters whose stories have enough substance and scope for full-length novels.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA point reiterated by most publishers. \xe2\x80\x9cIn India, we are fortunate to have a horde of mythological stories from which a writer can draw out new tales,\xe2\x80\x9d says Udayan Mitra, publisher-literary, HarperCollins India. He argues that the genre has the liberty to be more freewheeling, opening up new possibilities for the writer, as well as the reader. \xe2\x80\x9cAncient myths can be told in new, subjective and individualistic ways from today\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. There are tremendous possibilities and these can make for very interesting new stories,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mitra.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise then that people with diverse backgrounds\xe2\x80\x94politicians, academics, journalists, management gurus, etc\xe2\x80\x94are exploring the genre. Former chief minister of Karnataka Veerappa Moily, for instance, released his book, The Flaming Tresses of Draupadi, in April. Then there is Utkarsh Patel. The professor of comparative mythology at Mumbai University is the author of Shakuntala: The Woman Wronged and Satyavati, both published by Rupa Publications. Writer Kavita Kane is a former journalist, Jagmohan Bhanver is a leadership coach, while Saiswaroopa Iyer (author of Abhaya, a tale set in the times of the Mahabharata) is a former investment professional.\nBut the person who really brought the spotlight on the genre in India was author Amish. \xe2\x80\x9cThough Ashok Banker pioneered this sort of fantasy-style writing with his Ramayana series in 2003, it was with Amish\xe2\x80\x99s Shiva trilogy (2010) that mythology as a genre really broke out in India\xe2\x80\xa6 the Shiva trilogy exploded the category,\xe2\x80\x9d says Abraham. Amish has now shifted his focus to the Ramayana. His latest is Sita: Warrior of Mithila, which is the second book in the Ram Chandra series. In the pipeline is a book that will focus on Parshu Ram, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Another popular author in this genre is Devdutt Pattanaik. The mythologist, who has written bestsellers like The Pregnant King and Shikhandi and Other Tales They Don\xe2\x80\x99t Tell You, has close to 30 books in his repertoire.\nThe tremendous success of historical fiction in India can also be attributed to the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a genre people are already familiar with, say experts. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have noticed that the majority of the audience of these books is young adults. Overall, though, the books appeal to all age groups,\xe2\x80\x9d says Swagat Sengupta, chief executive officer, Apeejay Oxford Bookstores, an Indian bookstore chain, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen approximately 14% growth over last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\nContemporary reinterpretations of ancient mythological stories reflect the attitudes of the current culture, says Kapish Mehra, managing director, Rupa Publications. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number of manuscripts I receive in this genre has shot up drastically in the past two-three years,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. So how do writers choose their protagonists from the vast sea of stories available to them? Patel, who has written books on Satyavati and Shakuntala in the past, says he chose those characters because he found them intriguing. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt that there was a story waiting to be told. Many of us have been brought up on Kalidasa\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Mahabharata, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the original. Many readers don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Shakuntala was one of the first female characters from Vyasa\xe2\x80\x99s Mahabharata and that she was very different from the docile portrayal of Kalidasa,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Shakuntala: The Woman Wronged, Patel\xe2\x80\x99s book on Shakuntala, was published in September 2015 and went in for a reprint within six months. While reinterpreting, however, creative liberties have to be taken with care, says Patel, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIn these changing times, one does worry about what one writes. Often a certain word has to be changed to suit the present fragile sensibilities of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'By Andreas Cremer\nBERLIN, July 29 (Reuters) - Volkswagen\'s planned sale of motorcycle brand Ducati and transmissions maker Renk has currently no majority backing on the carmaker\'s supervisory board, with opponents to asset sales feeling invigorated by the group\'s strong results.\nEurope\'s largest automaker has tasked banks to evaluate options for Ducati and Renk including divesting the two divisions as it aims to streamline operations to help fund a post-dieselgate strategic overhaul.\nVolkswagen (VW) has been reviewing its portfolio of assets and brands since announcing in June 2016 a multibillion-euro shift to electric cars and new mobility services as part of its so-called Strategy 2025.\nBut VW\'s labour leaders, occupying half the seats on the 20-member supervisory board which decides on asset sales, resist a sale of Ducati and Renk without compelling financial reasons.\n"The employee representatives on Volkswagen\'s supervisory board will neither approve a sale of Ducati, nor one of Renk or MAN Diesel & Turbo," a spokesman for VW group\'s works council told Reuters late on Saturday.\n"Everyone who can read the VW half-year results should know: We don\'t need money and our subsidiaries are not up for grabs by bargain hunters."\nSix-month operating profit at VW group jumped 19 percent to 8.9 billion euros ($10.46 billion), the carmaker said on Thursday, as cost cuts and R&D improvements at the core namesake brand earned VW a respite from the billions of euros in costs for fines, vehicle refits and compensation related to its dieselgate scandal.\nThough Ducati is owned by VW\'s luxury brand Audi, the VW group\'s supervisory board has to approve a possible sale. Audi declined comment.\nThe billionaire Porsche and Piech families, controlling 52 percent of voting shares in VW and holding four supervisory board seats, do not support selling Ducati or Renk, two sources at VW group said.\nA spokesman for Porsche SE, the family\'s holding company, declined comment.\nWith 20 percent of voting rights in VW, Lower Saxony, where the carmaker employs more than 100,000 staff at six plants, can veto decisions such as factory closures.\nHolding two board seats, Lower Saxony traditionally teams up with VW\'s worker representatives for the sake of protecting jobs and projects. A spokeswoman declined comment when asked whether the state government would back a sale of Ducati or other assets.\n"The management board has not even asked the supervisory board of Volkswagen where such sales have to be ratified for its approval," the works council spokesman said. "Therefore we advise all supposedly interested parties: Save your time to check any books. A sale will not happen."\nFive bidders are shortlisted to buy Ducati, including Italy\'s Benetton family, with offers received valuing the brand at 1.3 billion-1.5 billion euros, a source said on Saturday.\nA third source at VW said that given strong union opposition, VW is now reviewing its plan to sell Ducati as it doesn\'t want to risk working with labour on implementing a hard-fought turnaround plan for the VW brand, seen as crucial by investors.\nVW finance chief Frank Witter, speaking on Thursday\'s earnings call, declined any comment on "speculation" surrounding VW\'s asset sales plans.

S'Drinking green tea may help combat memory impairment, insulin resistance and obesity, a study has claimed.\nThe study involving mice, suggests that EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), the most abundant catechin and biologically active component in green tea, could alleviate high-fat and high-fructose (HFFD)-induced insulin resistance and cognitive impairment.\nInsulin resistance occurs when insulin levels are sufficiently high over a prolonged period of time causing the body\'s own sensitivity to the hormone.\n"Green tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and is grown in at least 30 countries," said Xuebo Liu, a researcher at Northwest A&F University in China.\n"The ancient habit of drinking green tea may be a more acceptable alternative to medicine when it comes to combating obesity, insulin resistance, and memory impairment," said Liu.\nLiu and colleagues divided three-month-old male mice into three groups based on diet: a control group fed a standard diet, a group fed an HFFD diet, and a group fed an HFFD diet and two grammes of EGCG per litre of drinking water.\nFor 16 weeks, researchers monitored the mice and found that those fed HFFD had a higher final body weight than the control mice, and a significantly higher final body weight than the mice fed both HFFD and EGCG (HFFD+EGCG group).\nIn performing a Morris water maze test, researchers found that mice in the HFFD group took longer to find the platform compared to mice in the control group.\nThe HFFD+EGCG group had a significantly lower escape latency and escape distance than the HFFD group on each test day.\nWhen the hidden platform was removed to perform a probe trial, HFFD-treated mice spent less time in the target quadrant when compared with control mice, with fewer platform crossings.\nThe HFFD+EGCG group exhibited a significant increase in the average time spent in the target quadrant and had greater numbers of platform crossings, showing that EGCG could improve HFFD-induced memory impairment, researchers said.\n'

PTI file\nGrenoble, July 29\nBody parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources have said.\n(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had never found any significant human remains before,\xe2\x80\x9d he told AFP on Friday. This time, however, he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\nAnother Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\xe2\x80\x99s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese remains are probably not from the same person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say\xe2\x80\x9d.\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. \xe2\x80\x94 AFP\n'

S" Moms dish on their favorite maternity fitness clothes that helped them keep up their pregnancy workouts. \nYour life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop when you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant, and neither should your workouts. Once you get over the initial exhausted, morning-sickness hump and roll into the high-energy second trimester, there are tons of excellent reasons to hit the gym or pool. The US Department of Health & Human Services recommends getting in 150 minutes every week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity during pregnancy. What counts as moderate intensity? If your heart rate is up, you\xe2\x80\x99re sweating but can still talk normally (you just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sing if you tried), you\xe2\x80\x99re in the right zone. And mega benefits\xe2\x80\x94such as reduced risk of gestational diabetes, cesareans and preeclampsia, not to mention improved fitness and psychological well-being\xe2\x80\x94make maternity fitness a no-brainer. Of course, you want to be comfortable and still look good (hey, we hear you). No sweat! Here are our picks for best maternity workout clothes from fitness experts and moms alike.\nDo I Really Need Maternity Workout Clothes?\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re like most expectant moms, much of your pregnancy is spent buying things for baby\xe2\x80\x94furniture for baby\xe2\x80\x99s nursery, clothes, diapers, often even a new home. So it\xe2\x80\x99s common to not want to spend extra cash on maternity workout clothes you\xe2\x80\x99ll wear for a only few months. And sure, in the first trimester, you can easily get away with rolling waist bands under your belly and stretching out tees you have. But eventually, usually around week 20, that belly is going to start showing and such measures become wildly uncomfortable.\nPlus, to the surprise of many new moms, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a few months of wear. \xe2\x80\x9cIn hindsight, had I known I\xe2\x80\x99d wear maternity workout clothes after delivery, I\xe2\x80\x99d have spent more,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olivia Koszuta, a Denver mom of a 3-month-old baby girl who took Spin class twice weekly throughout her pregnancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still wearing Old Navy maternity leggings at three months out! Pants just don\xe2\x80\x99t fit normally for a while. It\xe2\x80\x99ll probably take another three months for my belly to go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEvery pregnancy is different. It\xe2\x80\x99s most important to assess the changes your body is experiencing. Then pick up the maternity workout clothes that ease any discomfort hampering your sweat sessions\xe2\x80\x94whether that\xe2\x80\x99s sports bras and bathing suits with less restrictive support, stretchier tees and tanks for growing bellies or leggings with over-the-belly waists.\nAs you change and grow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll quickly appreciate the value of maternity workout clothes, which are \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to support and flatter an expectant mom\xe2\x80\x99s bump,\xe2\x80\x9d says Melanie Darnell, an Los Angeles maternity fitness trainer and mom of three who founded Fitmomma Bootcamp. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get the extra support and length you need. Plus, feeling comfortable in your maternity workout clothes can be the confidence boost you need to get to the gym.\xe2\x80\x9d Koszuta agrees: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was so nice hearing the girls in Spin class say I looked cute in my fitness gear,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\nAnd good news: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to buy a ton of items or spend a fortune on maternity workout clothes\xe2\x80\x94just a few key items will do the trick. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of the types of exercise clothes you may want to consider, plus a few favorite items.\nMaternity Sports Bras\nOne major body change many pregnant women experience (and many of our partners readily notice) is a rapidly growing bust. It\xe2\x80\x99s often one of the first changes to cause discomfort, resulting in that familiar red ring that surfaces below the breasts when you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing a bra that\xe2\x80\x99s too small. Which makes pregnancy sports bras an essential component of your maternity workout clothes.\nAs early as six weeks into pregnancy, breasts can start growing larger. They\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to balloon throughout pregnancy\xe2\x80\x94in fact, many women go up one to two cup sizes. If you\xe2\x80\x99re well endowed to begin with, pregnancy workouts can quickly become uncomfortable if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t adjusted to a new bra.\nOne of the first moves for Calli De La Haye, a certified prenatal yoga instructor who co-founded Kalimukti Yoga, was to ditch all underwire designs and switch to a more comfy, forgiving style.\nSome mom-favorite maternity sports bras include:\n Photo: Courtesy of H&M MAMA \nOne of De La Haye\xe2\x80\x99s list of must-haves: H&M MAMA 2-pack Sleep Nursing Bras ($30), which feature a soft jersey and lined cups.\n Photo: Courtesy of H&M MAMA \nH&M MAMA 2-pack Soft Nursing Bras ($30) are made from a soft microfiber and include a wide elastic below the breasts.\n Photo: Courtesy of Victoria's Secret \nKoszuta\xe2\x80\x99s favorite? The Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret The Player By Victoria Sport Sport Bra ($15). \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re stretchy and comfy, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if it overstretched because I got a great price: two for $20,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n Photo: Courtesy of Belabumbum \nThe Belabumbum Sport Mesh Nursing Bra ($51) provides support and coverage as your chest grows during pregnancy and easy access for nursing\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s super-cute.\n Photo: Courtesy of Cake Lingerie \nThe Cake Maternity Zest Flexi Wire High Impact Maternity & Nursing Sports Bra ($80) minimizes bounce, reduces friction and wicks away moisture\xe2\x80\x94and it was Darnell\xe2\x80\x99s top pick.\nMaternity Workout Tops\nAs you\xe2\x80\x99re gathering up the best maternity workout clothes for your pregnancy, keep your eyes peeled for some good maternity workout tops. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a shirt long enough to go over your belly and beyond, made in comfortable, stretchy fabric. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want tanks and tees that provide the flexibility for you to grow through your trimesters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Teri Lang Patterson, a certified fitness instructor in South Dakota and new mom.\nGreat go-to maternity workout tank tops are:\n Photo: Courtesy of Old Navy \nOne of Patterson\xe2\x80\x99s favorites is the Old Navy Maternity Go-Dry Crossback Keyhole Tank ($20), which features shirred sides for a more flattering fit.\n Photo: Courtesy of Motherhood \nThe Motherhood Maternity Side Ruched Scoop Neck Maternity Tank Top ($15) is another solid option. (When my mom sent this to me during my pregnancy, it quickly became my go-to grab for daily walks.)\n Photo: Courtesy of Gaya \nAnother great option to add to your collection of maternity workout clothes? The Gaya Double The Fun Maternity Tank ($25), which comfortably covers the hips.\nOr check out these maternity workout shirts:\n Photo: Courtesy of Athleta \nAthleta\xe2\x80\x99s Finish Fast Tees ($44 to $55) are so stretchable, Koszuta stuck with these, which happened to be her prepregnancy faves.\n Photo: Courtesy of Mumberry \nThe Mumberry Vigor Maternity Shirt with Mumband Pregnancy Belt Support ($48) offers built-in back and belly support and super-stretchy softness.\n Photo: Courtesy of FitBump \nLooking for performance detailing in fun bold colors? Consider the FitBump Thalia Top ($52).\nMaternity Workout Pants and Other Bottoms\nIn terms of maternity workout pants and bottoms of any kind, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about having an easily expandable, comfy waist that won\xe2\x80\x99t distract you from your workout. The moms we spoke with all like the over-the-belly style. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can get maternity pants with elastic around the belly, but you get to a point where even those slide off,\xe2\x80\x9d Koszuta says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t happen with leggings that pull over your belly.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking for a good pair of maternity yoga pants? Trust us, the over-the-belly style will serve you well here too.\nSome of the best maternity workout leggings include:\n Photo: Courtesy of Ingrid & Isabel \nIngrid & Isabel Active Mesh Detail Capri ft. Crossover Panel legging ($88) sports a graphic gray-black design that\xe2\x80\x99s cut to cover the belly but keeps your back cool and gently supported.\n Photo: Courtesy of Old Navy \nThe moms we spoke with, as well as some instructors, swear by Old Navy Maternity Leggings ($15 to $30), which come in different weights and basic dark colors. Julie Goldin, a New York City mom of a 5-month-old baby girl, picked them up when she started showing at seven months. \xe2\x80\x9cHighly recommended and affordable,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n Photo: Courtesy of Motherhood \nMore of a pattern girl? Motherhood Maternity Secret Fit Belly Maternity Performance Leggings ($35) are comfy and come in a fun floral.\nNeed a pair of maternity workout capris?\n Photo: Courtesy of Old Navy \nPatterson\xe2\x80\x99s must-have is the Old Navy Full-Panel Compression Capris ($29). \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re made with dry-wicking material for cooling comfort and give compression throughout the legs to help with any excess fluids. Plus, the roll bands allow for full coverage or can roll down to fit under the growing belly,\xe2\x80\x9d Patterson says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know your body generates more heat than usual during pregnancy, and your maternity workout clothes need to breathe, support and grow with your bump.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget about maternity workout shorts\xe2\x80\x94especially for those hotter months.\n Photo: Courtesy of Old Navy \nWhether you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to work out in the gym or go for a run, the key to reliable maternity workout shorts is to have a nice full panel. Old Navy Maternity Full-Panel Go-Dry Cool Run Shorts ($20) offer exactly that in black or hot pink.\nMaternity Belly Belt\nMore than 60 percent of pregnant women experience lower-back pain during pregnancy, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. To help ease the strain, many maternity fitness instructors recommend wearing belly support bands with your maternity workout clothes\xe2\x80\x94and all the time! \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so important to support your growing belly,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sara Haley, a prenatal exercise specialist in Santa Monica, California, who is currently pregnant with her third baby. \xe2\x80\x9cBelly belts help take discomfort off the lower back and give core support to help with diastasis recti (separation of abdominal muscles) and pelvic-floor issues. They also give coverage to the belly if you\xe2\x80\x99re someone who likes or needs a little extra coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Photo: Courtesy of Belly Bandit \nHaley recommends the Belly Bandit Upsie Belly Pregnancy SupportBands ($70).\nMaternity Swimwear\nAnother exercise choice to ease lower-back pain during pregnancy is swimming. But gearing up can be a challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to keep teaching my water aerobics class while pregnant,\xe2\x80\x9d says Patterson, who taught into her 41st week. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was hard was finding supportive swimwear for fitness. The top neck needs to be high enough to accommodate a growing chest and many maternity swimsuits don\xe2\x80\x99t have a support feature under the breasts, which is essential.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Photo: Courtesy of Prego Swimwear \nAfter an exhaustive search, Patterson found one she liked from Prego Swimwear Maternity Sport Tank One Piece Swimsuit ($74).\n Photo: Courtesy of Eq Swimwear \nAnother solid choice? The EQ Banded Maternity Swimsuit ($86). It\xe2\x80\x99s got a horizontal band to support an expanding bust, and the slightly gathered fabric under the bust area leaves room for growth without sacrificing support.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth popping into a few stores to see what brands and price points you like best. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to break the bank stuffing your closets with maternity workout clothes, but a few key pieces can make a dramatic difference in how comfortable you are during your workouts\xe2\x80\x94and how great you feel after them. And we\xe2\x80\x99d say anything that gets you to the gym a bit more often is a sound investment.\nTop Photo Model Credit: Christina Caruso / @christinacarusostyle\n"

S'Photo: Tastyart Ltd Rob White / Getty Images\n It\'s not uncommon to slice into an avocado and be surprised to find a small or nonexistent pit \xe2\x80\x93 but that doesn\'t mean the flesh isn\'t safe to eat. \nImagine carving into a perfectly ripe avocado and expecting the warm, familiar feeling of pushing your blade right against the rock-solid pit \xe2\x80\x93 only to slip through and come clean through the entire avocado. \nAfter a few curse words and a band-aid or two, your heart settles back into place and you find yourself wondering\xe2\x80\xa6is this thing safe to eat?\nWell, my fellow avocado aficionados, I\'m here to set the record straight: if you find yourself staring down a pitless avocado, you\'ve just won the lottery because it IS safe to eat.\nDon\'t take my word for it. Dr. Jonathan Crane, a research specialist in the Department of Horticultural Studies at the University of Florida and a designated tropical fruit specialist at UF\'s Tropical Research & Education Center, says you should feel lucky if you find a pitless avocado. \n"No, there\'s absolutely nothing wrong with those avocados," Crane says. "This does happen very rarely, but you should be happy if you encounter this, if you ask me." \nHow rare, exactly? About one in every 100 avocados that find their way into your supermarket, Crane says, and this statistic grows higher if farmers who produce avocado crops choose to not cross-pollinate their fruits. \nHe shares that avocados are "genetically pre-disposed" to not bear regular-sized pits, or in some cases grow without pits at all, if they are purposefully not cross-pollinated. The producers who market their avocados as a "pitless" variation have chosen to forego cross-pollination, and thus a consumer can expect to usually find a smaller pit or no pit at all in that crop of avocados. \nCrane admits that there are many different varieties of avocados that consumers may come across that have smaller pits than an everyday Haas avocado, for example. \nIf you come across a variation of avocado that contains a remarkably smaller pit seed than what you\'re used to, Crane says, this is also due to a scientific term known as metaxenia. \n"Metaxenia has to do with pollen\'s influence on the physical attributes of the fruit," Crane says. "It can have influence over the size, seed shape, or quirky features of any given fruit \xe2\x80\x93 such as the sugar apple, for example." \nBut even within the most popular breeds of avocados, which are normally cross-pollinated and thus retain the pit seed size chefs and cooks are familiar with, you can find pitless variations as well as tiny seeds that you\'d cut right through. That\'s because marketing teams don\'t often promote a clear distinction between a Haas avocado and a very close cousin, says Crane. But that small genetic difference, or how the farmer chose to raise the crop, can make all the difference. \nBottom line? Don\'t ever throw out an avocado that might have a smaller pit or is completely pitless. Count your lucky stars that you\'re able to enjoy this genetic miracle that has gifted you ample creamy and delectable green flesh to feast on. And best of luck finding the next one at your local supermarket.\n'

S'Nataraja Temple:\nNataraja Temple is the main temple of Chidambaram, which is dedicated to the Nataraja or the dancing posture of Lord Shiva. This temple is located in the heart of the town and has undergone numerous renovations under the reign of Chola and Pallava kings. In 1213 AD, Aragalur Udaya Iraratevan Ponparappinan rebuilt some of the parts of this temple.\n The Nataraja Temple is known for its attractive gopurams, carvings, five mandapams and inscriptions. Built during the 10th century by Chola Kings, this temple is known for huge walls, four tall shikharas in four directions and a big Sivagangai tank. The four tall shikharas are decorated with 108 carved dance postures of Natya Shastra.There are five main principle sabhas in this temple, which are known as Chit Sabha, Kanaka Sabha, Deva Sabha, Nritya Sabha and Raja Sabha. The main idol of Lord Shiva or Nataraja resides in the Chit Sabha.\nPitchavaram Backwaters:\nPitchavaram Backwaters is a popular picnic spot, which is around 16 km from Chidambaram. The 11,000 hectares of backwater exploration is set against the backdrop of 3000 acres of mangrove forests. There are several channels and creeks at this backwater that are suitable for boating and other water sports.\nSome of the rare species that can be seen in the mangrove forests include Herons, Spoonbills, Rhizophara and others.

S' Stem cells hold the key to the aging process, according to new research. \nAs humans, we persist in being baffled by the steady aging of our bodies, which sometimes seems to occur at a faster rate than we might expect.\nConsequently, we often do our best to try to stall or "cheat" the aging process using a wide range of "remedies," from improving our diets to undergoing plastic surgery.\nResearchers are now looking into how stem cells found in a region of our brain called the hypothalamus might play a key role in how swiftly we age.\nDr. Dongsheng Cai, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in New York City, NY, alongside a team of specialists, has found that adding fresh stem cells to the hypothalamus might be the way to go if we want to delay old age.\nThe results of this study are published in the current issue of Nature.\n\'Stem cell numbers naturally decline\'\nPrevious research conducted at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine had already shown that the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in controlling aging.\nDr. Cai and his team have now been able to locate the specific cells that are responsible for the aging process: neural stem cells also involved in neurogenesis - that is, the creation of new brain neurons.\nThe researchers noted that the number of brain stem cells in the hypothalamus steadily decreases with time, and this impacts the speed at which the aging process unfolds. However, they add that their study has shown that this process can be counteracted.\n"Our research shows that the number of hypothalamic neural stem cells naturally declines over the life of the animal, and this decline accelerates aging. But we also found that [...] [b]y replenishing these stem cells or the molecules they produce, it\'s possible to slow and even reverse various aspects of aging throughout the body."\nIn their study, the researchers used mice to test the role of neural stem cells. They noticed that the number of stem cells in the animals\' hypothalamus started to decline at around 10 months old, which, according to the scientists, is long before aging becomes apparent.\n"By old age - about 2 years of age in mice - most of those [stem] cells were gone," notes Dr. Cai.\nSupplementary stem cells slow aging\nThe next step in the study was to test for causation, rather than just correlation, between decreasing numbers of neural stem cells and the onset of aging.\nTo do this, they selectively disrupted the relevant stem cells in middle-aged mice. They observed that, in these mice, aging took place much faster than in the control specimens, whose neural stem cells were left alone.\n"This disruption greatly accelerated aging compared with control mice, and those animals with disrupted stem cells died earlier than normal," says Dr. Cai.\nFinally, the researchers wanted to find out whether adding a "fresh supply" of stem cells to the hypothalamus could reverse the aging process.\nThey inserted new stem cells both into the hypothalami of the mice whose stem cells had been disrupted, and into those of normal, healthy middle-aged mice.\nDr. Cai and his colleagues found that this action was productive: in all the mice, the aging process was either slowed down, or different aspects of aging were counteracted altogether.\nWhat happens, the researchers note, is that the stem cells release microRNAs (miRNAs), which are a type of molecule involved in the regulation of gene expression.\nThe miRNAs are contained by exosomes, which are extracellular particles that the stem cells release into the fluid found inside and around the brain and the spinal cord, or cerebrospinal fluid.\nWhat the researchers specifically injected into the mice were exosomes containing miRNA that had been collected from hypothalamic stem cells. The extracted exosomes were released into the mice\'s cerebrospinal fluid and allowed to act.\nDr. Cai and his colleagues measured the effect of the stem cell "supplements" by analyzing tissue collected from the mice, as well as monitoring improvements in the specimens\' muscular endurance, cognitive abilities, and social behavior, among others.\nThe scientists explain that further research will include establishing which particular miRNAs and other particles released by neural stem cells are specifically involved in the "rejuvenating" process.\nThe researchers are hopeful that these studies may, in time, lead to much more efficient ways of slowing or even halting the effects of aging.\n'

S"Sonakshi Sinha is spending her vacations abroad and we are so jealous of her travel looks. The gorgeous actress is also very stylish and we know that for a fact.\nShe is also a travel buff and has recently been uploading her images from the long tour she has been on just after IIFA Awards 2017 ended.\nHer travel styles will definitely give you styling goals for the immediate next trip you are planning or are yet to plan.\nIn Hollywood\nSonakshi posted her latest picture from the Universal Studios in Hollywood where she too like every tourist posed in front of the studio banner.\nShe wore an olive green trench dress and she looked lovely. She combined the look with a cool pair of white sneakers, black shades and a black shoulder bag.\nIn San Francisco\nSonakshi posted a picture from San Francisco two days back and there too she actually killed it while posing in front of the Bay Bridge.\nShe was wearing a plain black tee along with a pair of blue denims and black boots. She had a grey cardigan tied on around her waist. She completed the look with a cap, shades and black boots.\nSurfing New York Streets\nSonakshi posted her image from last Saturday where she was roaming around the New York streets, looking super hot in a black pair of separates. She wore an oversized Kaftan top with a pair of over-sized pants. With the attire, she wore a simple pendant, black boots and her pair of black shades.\nThe look was totally a killer one.\nBeing 'Nature's Child'\nSonakshi's picture from beside a pond in New Jersey reflected the natural beauty in her. She wore a floral printed dress and beige strapped flats, looking gorgeous than ever.\nThe style book totally stunned us and threw light on how perfectly she has styled herself.\nAt Central Park\nSonakshi showered her ravishness as she posed at the Central Park in New York, wearing one of her best travel looks. She wore a simple pink trench jacket and a pair of embroidered jeans. She managed to look classy as ever, posing with her stances beside a lake at the park.\nBy The River\nJust after the IIFA Awards 2017, Sonakshi had started her tour and this was her first vacation picture beside the Hudson river in New York. She posed by the river, stunning as always.\nShe wore a floral printed spaghetti dress with a pair of rounded and half-rimmed shades. She looked too gorgeous, especially down under the sunset.\n"

Empty cache\nOne of the workarounds for this problem is emptying the cache of the system app Google Play Services. You can do the same by heading to the Settings of your Android smartphone and then tap on \xe2\x80\x98Applications\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98App Management\xe2\x80\x99 (the name might differ device to device but you should be able to understand which option is for applications).\nNow once you are in the app manager, you will see a couple of \xe2\x80\x98Tabs\xe2\x80\x99 at the top of the page such as All, Installed, Running and so on. You need to click on \xe2\x80\x98All\xe2\x80\x99 and then find the \xe2\x80\x98Google Play Services\xe2\x80\x99 app (normally, the apps are listed alphabetically, so you can simply scroll down to \xe2\x80\x98G\xe2\x80\x99 and locate the \xe2\x80\x98Google Play Services\xe2\x80\x99 and tap on it. You will find the option to \xe2\x80\x98Clear Cache\xe2\x80\x99 for the app. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the \xe2\x80\x98Clear Cache\xe2\x80\x99 option, there should be \xe2\x80\x98Storage\xe2\x80\x99 option, tap on it, and here you will find the \xe2\x80\x98Clear Cache\xe2\x80\x99. Now flush the cache, restart your Android phone, and say Goodbye to Google Play Services has stopped error.\nUnfortunately, sometimes clearing cache is not enough to kill this problem, so we have listed four more ways to fix the Google Play Services. If the issues still appearing on your device, please check out the other steps.\n2. Reset the app preferences\nIf your Google Play services error did not fix by clearing the cache, we suggest you reset the app preferences. For doing so, go to Application Manager the same way as you did in above step. Now try to locate the \xe2\x80\x98Reset the App Preferences\xe2\x80\x99 option. It could be at the top right, bottom, or anywhere on the page depending on the phone you are using. In my case, I am performing this step on LeEco phone and \xe2\x80\x98Reset the app preferences\xe2\x80\x99 is placed at the bottom\xe2\x80\x99. I assume that you have found the \xe2\x80\x98Reset app preferences\xe2\x80\x99, so now tap on it and you are done here. Now just restart your Android phone and see if the crappy message \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunately, google play services has stopped\xe2\x80\x9d still appears.\n3. Add your Google Account Once Again\nSo it appears the above two fixes didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out for your \xe2\x80\x98Google Play Services Has Stopped\xe2\x80\x99 error. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we still have three more fixes in our bucket.\nTo proceed with the third fix, go to the settings of your Android smartphone and look for \xe2\x80\x98Accounts\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Account Management\xe2\x80\x99. Tap on it and you will get a list of accounts that you have created on your device such as Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and so on. Tap on Google.\nAfter completing the above step, now click on the 3 dots symbol on the top right corner of your device. You should see \xe2\x80\x98Remove account\xe2\x80\x99 in the drop down options. Click on it so that your Google account is deleted.\nOnce this is done, you are going to add your account once again to your device. For this, you should go to Settings and then tap on Accounts. Here you tap on Add Account and select Google Account. You will now be on a screen with a wizard that asks you to enter your Gmail, email address, so follow the prompts to complete adding your Gmail account to your device once again. This step should certainly fix the \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle Play Services Has Stopped\xe2\x80\x9d error on your phone.\n4. Reinstall Google Play Services\nGoogle Play Services is a fundamental part of your Android device. So you cannot uninstall it completely. However, you have the option to deactivate the Android Device Manager and then reinstall all updates to make sure that you are back on the most recent version of the Google Play Services. This is how you go about doing it:\n(a). To deactivate Google Play Services, you must go to settings and then tap on device administrators and tap on Deactivate Android Device Manager.\n(b). Now uninstall Google Play Services by going into Settings and looking for Application Manager. Inside the Application Manager, you must tap on all and look for Google Play Services. You will now get the option to uninstall updates.\n(c). Now try using any app that will require Google Play Services. The app will automatically identify the absence of Play Services and prompt you to reinstall it.\n(d). Once it is reinstalled to the latest version, you can activate Android Device Manager by going to Settings > Security > Device Administrators.\n(e). Once it has been activated, you must reboot your device so that all changes are in effect. The \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunately, google play services has stopped\xe2\x80\x9d error should not return after the reboot.\n5. Clear the Google Services Framework cache\nYour Google Play Services relies on the Google Services Framework to run properly. Google Services Framework is a system app which stores information and ensures that your phone is synced with the Google servers for regular exchange of data. If something goes wrong here, your Google Play Services may not work as intended. To put things right you must do the following:\nGo to Settings and then tap on Application Manager. Now go to the section where all the applications are displayed and look for Google Services Framework. Tap on it and select Force Stop. Then tap on Clear Cache button (best cache cleaner apps) to flush the cache stored for this system app. Now reboot your device to make sure that the changes are registered to your device. This should help you get rid of the google play services has stopped error from recurring in the future.\nWith the help of these five solutions, you should be able to fix the \xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, Google Play Services Has Stopped\xe2\x80\x99 error on your Android smartphone. However, if none of this works, you may want to consider a trip to a professional who can check what is wrong and solve it. If this article helps you fix your Google Play Services error, give a thumbs up by sharing it on Facebook and Twitter.\n'

S'BMW announced on Twitter that it will reveal a car at Pebble Beach this year. It will be shown on August 17, and BMW says that "the road will never be the same" because of it. BMW frequently shows one-off concepts at Pebble Beach, such as its retro Turbomeister 2002 Hommage from last year. But that statement about changing the road in some way leads us to believe it could be connected to a production car, if it\'s not an actual production car itself.\nFind out what is hiding in the dark on August 17th at Pebble Beach. pic.twitter.com/1SZp8w4VXR\n \xe2\x80\x94 BMW (@BMW) July 28, 2017 \n The only other details we get about the vehicle are from the teaser sketch included in the tweet. The car is quite obviously a droptop of sorts, and it appears to have cowls behind the seats, indicating it could be a two-seat speedster. The lengthy nose also suggests this is a front-engined car. BMW does have its Z4 successor in development, and we have yet to see any kind of preview of that car aside from spy shots. However, we think the car suggested by this drawing is too long to be the relatively compact, Toyota-based BMW.\n The size would be fitting for a speedster version of BMW\'s upcoming 8 Series flagship coupe. BMW is also getting close to releasing the big two-door, as evidenced by its recent coupe concept, and near-production-ready prototypes we\'ve seen in spy photos. Now the two-seat layout might seem to contradict this, but for a concept, it would be easy to add the extra bodywork and cowl to cover up the area seats would have filled. If it reaches production, a convertible 8 Series probably would retain its rear seats, similar to the 6 Series cabriolet. We look forward to seeing the fully revealed car in a couple of weeks.\n Related Video: \n'

S'By Deena Beasley\n(Reuters) - Available data supports the safety of Dynavax Technologies Corp\'s experimental hepatitis B vaccine when administered to adults, a panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday.\nMuch of the panel discussion focused on the need for Dynavax to carefully track patient outcomes due to concerns about safety of the vaccine, which has been rejected twice before by the regulatory agency.\nThe advisory committee voted 12 to 1, including one emailed vote and three abstentions, that data supports the safety of the vaccine, Heplisav-B, for adults 18 years and older. A prior panel voted 13 to 1 that clinical trial data supports the vaccine\'s effectiveness, Dynavax said.\nFDA staffers, in a review released earlier this week, said the experimental hepatitis B vaccine is effective, but that there were more deaths and serious heart problems in patients given the vaccine than in those who took a rival product. \nThe FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.\nIf the FDA approves the vaccine, peak sales could reach $650 million a year, according to Katherine Xu, an analyst at William Blair. She said Heplisav could become the standard of care since it has an easier dosing schedule than GlaxoSmithKline Plc\'s Engerix-B.\nIn its past rejections of Heplisav-B, the FDA cited unresolved safety concerns. The second rejection, in November, sent Dynavax\'s shares plunging roughly 70 percent to a year low of $3.20. They have since bounced back, closing at $9.25 on Thursday.\nThe new review of Heplisav-B comes before the FDA at an opportune time. Recent legislation requires the agency to find ways of speeding new products to the market and President Donald Trump has described the agency\'s approval process as "slow and burdensome."\nHeplisav-B is designed to enhance the body\'s immune response to the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, cancer and death. There is no cure. The virus is spread through sexual contact, sharing of needles, accidental needle sticks, and from mother to child during pregnancy.\nThe FDA is expected to make its decision next month.\n (Additional reporting by Toni Clarke; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Bernard Orr)\n'

S'Task Group Taji has begun training Iraqi Security Forces in night combat as it reshapes their training to help them foil Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s new tactics.\nThe combined New Zealand-Australian defence force in Iraq is adding new training techniques to help local soldiers keep a hold on gains made against Islamic State.\n Major General Tim Gall, Commander Joint Forces New Zealand, said the force was "night combat training" to counter the "non-conventional tactics" of the jihadists as they sought to retain the few pockets of Iraq still under Isis control.\n "So on the tactical level, we need to adjust the training to help Iraqi troops maintain security in areas liberated from Isis and deal with the changing nature of the fight against the Islamic militants," Gall said.\n Training continued at the huge military base in Iraq, Camp Taji, and at other secure alternative locations across Iraq, he said.\nIn June, 2016, when then-Prime Minister John Key announced the Government had agreed to extend the stay of Kiwi soldiers in Iraq by another 18 months, he promised to keep troops "behind the wire". This meant keeping them within Camp Taji, or other secure training locations. \nThe New Zealand-Australian task force has trained around 25,000 Iraqi troops and Federal Police since its training mission began in May 2015.\nAt the time, the Opposition described the use of other locations as the "beginning of mission creep". \nWhen asked if Saturday\'s announcement meant soldiers would be going beyond the wire, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) confirmed the "alternative locations" were those already in use.\n"Earlier this year we started training at other locations, so this is no extension of the mission at all," a spokesman said.\nTask Group Taji is made up of about 100 New Zealand soldiers and 300 Australian Defence Force personnel.\nThe NZDF\'s Senior National Officer in Camp Taji said the first group of 35 Iraqi soldiers had started the six-day night combat course, which was developed by five NZDF trainers.\nThe trainees were combat veterans keen to upskill, he said. "The enhanced ability to operate under cover of darkness will help them defeat Isis."\nThe course covered patrolling and movement by night, including conducting ambushes, he said. It would finish with the trainees carrying out a night ambush.\nAustralian Army Major James Tarpley, Officer Commanding of Task Group Taji\'s Advise and Assist team, said this type of training was vital to help the Iraqi Army keep Isis on the back foot.\nIn July, the military celebrated the liberation of Mosul from Isis after nearly nine months of urban warfare, three years after the Sunni Islamist group took the city. Much of the country\'s second-largest city was left in ruins and thousands of people were killed, with nearly a million more displaced.\nHowever, the group still controlled a handful of Iraqi towns and cities. \nTask Group Taji, made up of about 100 New Zealand soldiers and 300 Australian Defence Force personnel, has trained about 25,000 Iraqi troops and Federal Police since its mission began in May 2015, according to the NZDF.\n'

Tiwari identified the accused as Anil, 24, Amit Prajapati, 28, Raja Bihari, 23, and Karim Khan, 25, -- all residents of Najafgarh Delhi.\nTiwari said that Khan was arrested from Najafgarh area in the early hours of Thursday while the rest were arrested from Najafgarh on Saturday.\n"Accounts of eye witnesses and mobile tower tracking led to the arrest of Karim Khan within four-five hours of the murder. His interrogation helped us in arresting the other accused," Tiwari told IANS.\nOn Wednesday, the accused, who were drunk, asked a waiter at the eatery to point a cooler at the eatery in their direction.\nMayank objected to this, at which one of the accused forcefully pointed the cooler towards their table and leading to a scuffle between the two.\nThough Singh who was sitting at the cash box tried to rescue his son, one of the men took out a pistol and fired at Mayank and Shyam was shot later.\nShyam died on the spot while his son succumbed to injuries at a private hospital in Dwarka.\nPolice said that Anil had five cases registered against him, while the other three accused were school dropouts and worked as bike mechanics.\n'

S'If your clothes are bursting at the seams and you are short of breath all the time, it is time for urgent change in lifestyle. Getting in shape can be a lot easier than actually imagined. It is a three pronged effort \xe2\x80\x93 gentle workouts, change in diet and lifestyle changes. An exercise bike would be the best way to kick off your program to turn healthy and stay away from a hospital emergency.\nPeddle your way to loose pants and breathing that is not labored\nRegular training is the ideal way to burn the fat efficiently. A gradual increase in speed and sessions with little breaks will help you make the workout more interesting and feasible. Having a go, till complete exhaustion in the first session will end up taking you away from the exercise bike away for long. Make gradual improvements till you experience the results for yourself.

The TABATA workout is a good and scientific way of combating fat. Involving multiple sessions, beginning with a warm up of five minutes, it involves eight repetitions of twenty seconds high intensity, high speed pedalling, with intervals of ten seconds, it is touted to be the flame thrower at fat, swallowing up calories.\nHitting the fat with HIIT\nMost of the workouts on an exercise bike will fetch results, provided sufficient time is spent atop the seat and not beside it. The key is to get faster results and HIIT is another great workout to get the best results. Involving a lengthy warm up and two round of five repetitions, the session concludes with a cooling off. Designed to have maximum impact on fat, the sessions take up around thirty to forty minutes. It is worth to spend this period of time every day as an investment in a healthy future, with the added benefits of looking and feeling good.\nAbout the Company\n Gymsportz.sg is one of the leading exercise equipment online suppliers in Singapore.

S'Tesla has produced 50 of the Model 3 so far, including 20 for testing purposes.\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Friday the Model 3 had over half a million advance reservations as he handed over the first 30 to employee buyers, setting the stage for the biggest test yet of the company\'s strategy to become a profitable, mass market electric car maker.\nOutside Tesla\'s Fremont, California factory in US, Musk showed off the $35,000 (NZ$46,590) base vehicle with a range of 350 kilometres on a charge that marks a departure from the company\'s earlier luxury electric cars.\nMusk took to the stage driving a red Model 3, and said Tesla has produced 50 of the vehicles so far, including 20 for testing purposes.\nHours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be "quite a challenge" to build the car during the early days of production.\n"We\'re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell," Musk told journalists.\nThe over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits.\nAny new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said.\nA longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 500 km on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a 15-inch touchstream display to the right of the driver.\nTesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production.\nWere Tesla to produce and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States.\nProduction delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla\'s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year.\nMusk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems.\nTesla has burned through over $2 billion in cash so far this year ahead of the launch.\nA troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations.\nTesla\'s share price has surged 54 percent since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla\'s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\nUntil now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman CEO who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account.\nNow loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the United States.\nThe Model 3 is part of Musk\'s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi-trailer trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems. \n'

S'New Delhi: A new consumer protection bill that is likely to be tabled during parliament`s ongoing monsoon session is seen as the next big game-changer for the common man, replacing as it will legislation that has been in force since 1986 when the economic landscape and consumer awareness were in their infancy.\nAmong a slew of measures, the bill proposes to establish an investigating, prosecuting, reviewing and recommending body -- the Central Consumer Protection Authority, on the lines of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), headed by a Commissioner -- to launch inquiries, either suo motu or on a complaint or direction from the government, into violations of consumer rights and to launch prosecution in an appropriate court.\nThe bill introduces the much-needed concept of affixing liability on a manufacturer or producer and even a product seller in certain specified circumstances for any personal injury, death or property damage caused to a consumer resulting from defects in manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging, or labelling of any product.\nOne of the interesting new additions to minimise frivolous litigation is the requirement to deposit 50 percent of the total amount that the defendant has been asked to pay in terms of the appealable order in case he intends to prefer an appeal to an Appellate Commission.\nThe penalty for filing a frivolous complaint has also been proposed to be enhanced from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 to minimise baseless and false complaints.\nIn keeping with the changing times, the Bill defines e-commerce while at the same time empowering the Centre to make rules for preventing unfair trade practices in online trade. It also brings new forms of trade under the purview of the act to safeguard the interests of consumers further.\nOnce the new law comes into force, the liability of manufacturers and service providers, online and offline, will not be primarily limited to any consumer who buys goods or avails service but towards all consumers. This leads towards the class action suits introduction in the country in which all affected consumers will derive benefits.\nThe three-tier structure for adjudicating consumer disputes still remains in the form of district, state and national commissions but with enhanced values at each level looking at the current market realities.\n"We believe that the consumer is the most important stakeholder in the supply chain and bringing higher value to the consumer is sine quo non for survival in a competitive business environment... It is, therefore, important that such consumer protection laws are within the constitutional framework while providing effective, quick and realistic remedies to the consumers," FICCI Secretary General A. Didar Singh told IANS.\n"The consumer protection bill is sought to bring substantial modifications to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to address emergence of global supply chains, rapid development of e-commerce and to tackle misleading advertisements, telemarketing, multi-level marketing and direct selling," he added.\nBejon Misra, a consumer policy expert and founder, Consumer Online Foundation, told IANS: "The three-decade-old Consumer Protection Act in its present form is an inefficient piece of legislation not keeping pace with the new market dynamics, multi-layered delivery chains, innovative and many times misleading advertising and marketing machinery."\n"In the changing market place with e-commerce and financial products having made heavy inroads, the outdated Consumer Protection Act of 1988 serves little or no purpose in protecting consumers. Blatant misleading advertisements are selling norms today. Thus the only way to protect consumers from falling prey is to introduce authoritative powers, strengthening of consumer commissions, class action suits, penalties and host of other measures as exist in the draft amendment bill," Ashim Sanyal, COO of NGO Consumer VOICE, told IANS.\nThe bill, originally drafted in 2015 and tabled in the Lok Sabha last year, was subsequently sent to the Standing Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs. It now awaits cabinet approval. Even though it figures in the Lok Sabha`s list of business for the monsoon session, this can happen only after the cabinet`s nod.\n'

S'Washington: Good news for those who wish to lose weight, as a team has identified two new types of cells in the brain that can potently regulate appetite and offer new drugs to treat obesity. According to Rockefeller University researchers in New York, the two types of cells, located in a part of the brainstem called the dorsal raphe nucleus, are potential targets for new drugs to treat obesity by controlling the hunger signals that drive the search for and consumption of food.\nThe results indicated that neurons in the part of the brain played a role in feeding behaviour. They also offer a possible solution to a problem that has dogged previous efforts to address obesity at the neuronal level. "The recent data suggest that modulation of the activity of specific neurons with drugs could bypass leptin resistance and provide a new means for reducing body weight," said another researcher Jeffrey Friedman.\nFirst study author Alexander Nectow and his colleagues zeroed in on the dorsal raphe nucleus, or DRN, when whole-brain imaging made with iDISCO, an advanced technique developed at Rockefeller, revealed that this part of the brain becomes activated in hungry mice.\nSubsequent imaging of other mice that were fed more than their normal amount of food, until they were full, revealed a different pattern of DRN activity. "One is that the cells are just along for the ride--they are getting activated by hunger but they\'re not actually driving the food intake process. The other possibility is that they are in fact part of the sense and respond mechanism to hunger--and in this case, we suspected the latter," Nectow added.\nThe researchers also studied the effect of switching off hunger neurons in obese mice. Another researcher Marc Schneeberger Pane stated that prolonged inhibition of these neurons could dramatically reduce body weight.\nThe findings open up new avenues of research into exactly how the brain controls eating, and suggest that drugs designed to activate or inhibit neurons in the DRN could be effective in treating obesity and preventing its related disorders, such as diabetes and hypertension. The study appears in journal Cell.\n'

S' Singer Akriti Kakkar, who will be performing with her twin sisters Sukriti and Prakriti Kakkar at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) next month, says she is more like a mother to them.\n"I\'m very protective towards my sisters. They are nine years younger to me and I\'m like a mother to them," Akriti told IANS.\nPopular for songs like "Saturday Saturday", "Iski uski" and "Waada karo", Akriti says her relation with her sisters is healthy and there is no competition.\n"When each time we come out with a song, the discussion is healthy. There is always so much to learn from each other. We have different lives, but whenever we come together as siblings to perform or otherwise, there is every other feeling but rivalry or competition," she added.\nTo make their performance memorable at the IFFM, Akriti said: "Since the platform is such a prestigious one in awards, we have thought of depicting what Indian music is all about from the perspective of youth."\n"The performances will be basically in four different capsules, varying from unplugged to folk, commercial Bollywood, retro and little bit of fusion. It will depict what we all like and listen to."\nTalking about her journey in Bollywood so far, Akriti said she started singing at the age of five years and always planned to sing for Bollywood only.\n"After I completed my 12th standard, my dad took a promise from me that if I get a certain percentage in my exams, he would take me to Mumbai so that I could take up singing as my career... And that\'s what happened."\n"I started singing, and it was difficult time... Music directors Vishal-Shekhar gave me my first break in the movie \'Dus\' for singing \'Chham se wo aa jaye\'. I did a lot of songs with music trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and director-singer Himesh Reshammiya.\nShe says recognition for playback singers in Bollywood needs to get better.\n"I wish it was better, but it\'s getting better (recognition of playback artistes)... It is way better than how it was 10 years ago. It is all because of the social media revolution as it has became easier for the singers to tell people out there that it\'s their song."\nCommenting on independent music in today\'s time, Akriti said: "In times when pop music was flourishing, people used to like indie singers like Lucky Ali and Alisha Chinai. If similar amount of publicity is done on a non-film album these days, they will reach out to the people.\nAkriti also has plans for indie projects in the future.\n'

What\xe2\x80\x99s more, customers will be able to file complaints using the app and even reply to queries from the tax department. It is not clear whether e-filing would be possible via the app, but if done, it could prove quite handy as with a few clicks and taps, taxpayers would be able to file their returns.\nAlthough this is a good initiative, the government needs to work on delivery. For instance, the Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Provident Fund Organisation has had a website for a few years now, but its functioning has been erratic. The site has faced several crashes in the past. The MyTax app needs to emulate the success of Twitter Sewa or My Gov app if the tax department wants to ease the load of tax-filing. An Icrier report highlights the contribution of apps to GDP growth. It points out that a 10% increase in India\xe2\x80\x99s total internet traffic, delivers on an average a 3.3% increase in India\xe2\x80\x99s GDP, and a similar gain in mobile internet traffic increases country\xe2\x80\x99s growth by 1.3%. It is estimated that these services added $104 million to GDP in FY16 and are expected to add $537 million by 2020. If a similar platform is replicated for corporate tax applications as well, it would help India achieve a higher ranking for the ease of doing business\xe2\x80\x94the country currently ranks 172 out of 190 countries in terms of the ease of paying taxes.\n'

Diphtheria, a vaccine-preventable disease, has again surfaced in the State with three confirmed cases being reported from a residential school in Mysuru this week. \nFifteen other children, from Mahaboodhi Residential School at Mysuru, suspected to have contracted the disease, are also under treatment. \nTwo of these children were treated at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Bengaluru and have been discharged, said institute Director Asha Benekappa. \nAll the suspected cases from the residential school, located in Saraswathipuram in Mysuru, have been isolated and admitted to the Epidemic Diseases hospital in Mysuru. \nThey are from Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh, and they have either missed vaccination or have been partially vaccinated, according to the doctor.\nMysuru District Health Officer Basavaraj said all the children in the school, who showed symptoms, had been administered DPT dose and booster tablets. \nState figures\nAt the State-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Bengaluru, 16 confirmed cases have been reported from June till date this year. \nOf these, four children succumbed to the disease. From January this year till date, the institute has seen over 85 cases, said Dr. Asha Benekappa.\nHowever, State Deputy Director (Immunisation) A. Ramachandra Bairy told The Hindu the State reported 15 confirmed and 45 suspected cases from January this year. Dr. Bairy said while most of the affected are partially immunised or have missed vaccination, a few fell prey to it due to malnutrition. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is of concern is that people are not taking precautions though the disease is largely preventable. Pentavalent vaccine, which is part of the universal immunisation programme, can be taken free at government hospitals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Bairy.\nOut of ignorance\nDr. Asha Benekappa said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe vaccine has to be taken at six weeks, 10th and 14th weeks, which is later followed up with booster dose at 18 months, five years and 10 years. While some are ignorant about the schedule, others are not motivated.\xe2\x80\x9d She said there is a need for a massive campaign to check spread of the disease.\n'

S'In what is likely the most serious data breach of its kind, Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s entire vehicle and license register was uploaded to cloud servers and emailed in plain text to marketers. More horrifying is the fact that register contains information on police and military vehicles as well as information on individuals in witness protection programs.\nSwedish media reported the breach, with some stating that the Swedish Transport Authority handed over \xe2\x80\x9cthe keys to the kingdom\xe2\x80\x9d to, well, everyone. The database even includes information on the weight capacity of all the roads and bridges in Sweden. This is a serious security risk.\nAccording to The Hacker News, the names, photos and addresses of all members of the air force, the police, special forces and members of Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s witness relocation program have been leaked. The \xe2\x80\x9cType, model, weight, and any defects in all government and military vehicles, including their operator,\xe2\x80\x9d was also leaked, adds the report.\nThe Local reports that the breach can be traced to Maria \xc3\x85gren, Director General of the Transport Agency, who was fired for \xe2\x80\x9cundisclosed reasons\xe2\x80\x9d in January this year. She was later fined 70,000 kronor (around Rs 5.5 lac) for being \xe2\x80\x9ccareless with secret information,\xe2\x80\x9d which was the point at which media discovered and reported the data breach.\nIn a bid to cut down on expenditure, the Transport Authority, at Maria \xc3\x85gren\xe2\x80\x99s behest, apparently outsourced the management of the vehicle and license register to IBM in April 2015. The Authority was reportedly facing a severe cash crunch and was pressed for time; as a result, the contract was handed over to IBM without a proper security audit.\nWhile the Swedish government has no issue with outsourcing IT security and data, it expects that a thorough security audit be done. In this case, an unknown number of Eastern European security professionals \xe2\x80\x93 including some in the Czech Republic -- who did not have the proper clearance apparently handed the data.\nThe data was also uploaded to IBM\xe2\x80\x99s cloud servers without a security audit of said servers. To top it off, The Hacker News reports that the Transport Authority itself mailed the entire database in plain text to marketers.\nSensitive databases are normally encrypted. In the event of a data breach, a hacker would still have to decrypt the database to extract useful data. For a properly secured database, this task should be virtually impossible. The fact that the database was emailed in plain text means that all the information contained in the database is readily accessible to anyone with access to the database.\nSweden\xe2\x80\x99s security police unit S\xc3\xa4po is currently handling the investigation. The breach occurred in 2015, but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t discovered until 2016. Reports suggest that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be contained till later this year.\nThe extent of the Swedish data breach reveals the importance of securing all-encompassing databases like Aadhaar and even brings into questioning the necessity of maintaining a centralised database of this nature.\nIt takes just one misstep to compromise the privacy of an entire nation.\n'

S'Goop goddess Gwyneth Paltrow is all about shelling out occasionally impractical lifestyle advice, but there is definitely merit to her latest craze that will have you rethinking the way you sleep. So, just what is clean sleeping? Here\'s what to know about this Goop-approved trend. While the name implies it might mean taking a shower and hopping into a bed of fresh sheets, clean sleeping is actually the practice of prioritizing sleep above everything else, which makes sense. \nGetting enough sleep is kind of like gassing up your car. You can\'t drive very far once the tank hits empty, and eventually your car will stall and leave you stranded on the side of the road. Think of your body like a car, and sleep like that premium gas you usually forgo in favor of the cheap stuff.\n"Sleep plays such a powerful role in determining your appetite and energy levels that I believe it should be your first priority \xe2\x80\x94 even before you think about your diet," Paltrow and Goop editors explained in the Daily Mail, adding that poor sleep can lead to a number of health problems, including inflammation and poor immunity. It can also potentially mess with your memory.\nIs sleep the key to everything? \nHow To Practice Clean Sleeping\nVivien Killilea/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nPaltrow\'s new book, Goop Clean Beauty, touts the magic of clean sleeping. Personally, in my 20s I worked three jobs, went to school full time, and went out most nights. When I hit my 30s I was no longer able to function on little-to-no sleep without looking like I\'d been hit by a bus, and acting like a toddler who\'d missed a nap. That\'s because our bodies need sleep in order to repair and rejuvenate, according to Dr. Laura Lefkowitz, leading nutritional scientist and hormone adviser.\nPaltrow has an entire regimen she recommends, but you can just take what makes sense to you and leave the rest. Here are her steps to clean sleeping your way to a better life.\n1. Get 9-10 Hours Of Shut Eye Every Night\nMost experts agree with this. Arianna Huffington has even declared sleep the next feminist issue. And, while the National Sleep Foundation recommends seven to nine hours of sleep for adults a night, most women don\'t get that.\n2. Go To Bed At The Same Time Every Night\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Paltrow recommends going to bed at the same time every night, preferably by 10 p.m. Wow, that sure sounds early. A study reported in the Daily Mail  said that going to bed at the same time each night helps your body filter out stress hormones and stabilizes your circadian (internal) body clock.\n"Exposure to consecutive days of sleep loss can impair cardiovascular function and these negative effects might be enhanced when changes in feeding and/or sleep-wake habits lead to a circadian disruption," study author Dr. Daniela Grimaldi said in the Daily Mail.\nDr. Sujay Kansagra, director of Duke University\xe2\x80\x99s Pediatric Neurology Sleep Medicine Program, told the Huffington Post that going to bed at the same time every night makes sense, but that you should choose a time that works for you versus stressing over light\'s out by 10 p.m. because, seriously.\n      Giphy \n3. Power Down Your Devices Before Bed\nYou probably already know this, but the light emitted from your phone, computer, and tablet promote wakefulness. In order to successfully drift off to dreamland, you might want to consider giving yourself a screen curfew. Since sleep is supposed to be relaxing and rejuvenating, consider activities before bed that promote this feeling. A bath, or reading a good book are both good ideas.\n4. Curb Your Afternoon Caffeine \nWhile you might be tempted to mainline coffee throughout the day Lorelai Gilmore style, having caffeine after 2 p.m. can mess with your sleep, Luisa Brenton reported on Collective Evolution. If you must have coffee, go for decaf. I won\'t tell anyone, I promise. And, I\'ll be sipping the decaf, too.\n5. Meditate \nThe Huffington Post reported that Paltrow recommends practicing Yoga Nidra, a kind of yogic meditation designed to help you develop a sense of wholeness, according to Yoga International. If this isn\'t your jam, experts agree that any meditation is beneficial. Consider this cognitive shuffling meditation to help turn off your brain before you drift off to dreamland. \n      Giphy \n6. Relax\nPaltrow recommends relaxing with a trigger-point head and foot rub, according to the Huffington Post. However, Dr. Kansagra said that anything that makes you feel relaxed will do the trick. \nShe also recommended taking magnesium, but Dr. Kansagra warned that this can actually cause problems for people who don\'t really need it. "Giving magnesium to otherwise healthy individuals can lead to diarrhea, which can certainly worsen sleep. Most sleep physicians would not routinely recommend magnesium supplementation," he told the Huffington Post.\nThe Clean Sleeping Verdict? \n      Giphy \nIt\'s probably worth mentioning that Paltrow also recommends sleeping with an $80 copper pillowcase, which is said to help fight wrinkles and stave off bacteria, but experts call BS on this one. Dr. Joseph Krainin, the chief medical adviser for SoClean, a company that sells equipment for sanitizing sleep apnea machines, told the Huffington Post that while comfy bedding is ideal, it\'s not a major factor in increased sleep benefits. \nIf you have $80 to burn on pillowcases, then by all means, go for it. If you don\'t, not using this fancy pillowcase is not going to affect your sleep.\nIn general, this clean sleeping ritual is pretty much all common sense, and it\'s nothing that doctors and sleep experts haven\'t been saying for ages. But, if having it packaged and promoted by Goop and Paltrow makes something as vital as sleep suddenly hip and trendy, then kudos to Paltrow for getting people to take their medicine without a spoonful of sugar.\n'

S" Dhaka, July 29 - The exact number of tigers living in the Bangladesh part of the Sundarbans will be determined by 2019, officials conducting a census in the country's lone natural tiger habitat have said. \n THE Bangladesh Forest Department is conducting the census in collaboration with WildTeam, an NGO working for tiger conservation, in Satkhira, Khulna, Sharankhola and Chandpai ranges of the Sundarbans using the camera trapping method, the Dhaka Tribune reported on Friday.\n The census, under the Bengal Tiger Conservation Activity project, began in November 2016 to determine the exact number of tigers in the world's largest mangrove forest, of which around 60 per cent lies in Bangladesh.\n The most recent census concluded in 2015 recorded only 106 tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans, down from 440 in 2004.\n The census will determine if the number has been constant, fallen or has risen.\n The data collection for the census has been completed in Satkhira range. It will be extended to the Khulna, Sharankhola and Chandpai ranges by 2019.\n According to officials, primary monitoring and count in Satkhira began on December 1 and ended on March 15. A total of 45 officials divided into six teams conducted the survey.\n We set up 804 cameras at 402 stations in the range to collect data of tiger movement and density in the area, said Sayed Ali, divisional forest officer at the Sundarbans West Zone.\n Using photos taken by the cameras, the population in Satkhira range will be determined by analysing the stripes on the tigers -- each tiger has its own unique set of stripes.\n We will get the accurate number of tigers in Satkhira by September, Sayed said.\n Besides the camera trapping method, the team has also surveyed tiger activity in the canals.\n Amir Hossain Chowdhury, director of the census project, said: The photos are being analysed using the latest technologies. Once the analysis is done, we will get an idea about the population density and footprints of tigers in Satkhira.\n It might take two more years to complete the survey in the entire Sundarbans and find the exact number of tigers in the forest, Amir said.\n The Forest Department has undertaken the project following the declaration at the International Tiger Forum which took place in St Petersburg in 2010.\n According to the Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division, the previous census began in November 2013 and ended in 2015, also using a camera trapping method.\n At that time, the census covered just the areas with high population density, which amounted to only 26 per cent of the 6,017 square km of the mangrove forest inside Bangladesh.\n Thirty officials conducted the census using photos collected by 90 cameras, and recorded only 106 tigers living in the Sundarbans.\n The population was 453 in 1982 and 440 in 2004, according to the Forest Department.\n The department attributed the massive drop in numbers in just a decade to illegal poaching of wildlife and increasing human-tiger conflict.\n At least 49 tigers were killed and 232 people killed in tiger-human conflict between 2001 and 2014, the official said.\n The Royal Bengal Tiger has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2010.\n --IANS\n py/vm \n"

S'Middle school students captured this spectacular photo of the Grand Canyon from space using the internet-operated Sally Ride EarthKAM on the International Space Station on April 3, 2017. NASA showcased the image on May 30.\n The spectacular Grand Canyon reigns below wispy clouds in a new jaw-dropping view from the International Space Station (ISS).\n This image was captured by the student-controlled Sally Ride EarthKAM camera on the ISS. The camera is named after the late NASA astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, who initiated the development of a predecessor program, called KidSat. (Ride died in 2012 of pancreatic cancer.) [Amazing Photos of U.S. National Parks from Space]\n "The Sally Ride Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students (Sally Ride EarthKAM) program provides a unique educational opportunity for thousands of students multiple times a year," NASA officials wrote in an image description. "EarthKAM is an international award-winning education program, allowing students to photograph and analyze our planet from the perspective of the International Space Station." \n To operate EarthKAM, students use a web-based interface to remotely control a digital camera on the space station. That allows them to photograph the coastlines, mountain ranges and other interesting geographical features of Earth, NASA officials said.\n EarthKAM has been in operation since the first mission to the space station, Expedition 1, in 2000. It is used for about four missions per year. The next program, Mission 58, begins this fall. Middle school teachers and students who are interested in participating in the program can apply via the EarthKAM website. \n The Grand Canyon awes tourists with its immense size. It is about 277 miles (446 kilometers) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, according to the U.S. National Park Service. \n'

S' Before more food lands in the trash, get schooled on the several simple ways you and your family can toss less.\nPeter Dazeley \xc2\xa9(c) Peter Dazeley\n Take On Trash \nWe Americans buy more food than we can eat. Then we waste it \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of it. Cutting back on wasted food can start with minor changes to how you buy, and can extend to what you buy, where you buy and how you cook.\nSean Malyon \xc2\xa9(c) Sean Malyon\n Take Inventory \nYou knew this was coming. The spacious cabinets and palatial refrigerators in many kitchens could house a small family. Things get lost in the back there. Three times a year, take everything out of there, and use up the stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s still good, like the fun flavored yogurt you still remember buying.\nMartin Poole \xc2\xa9(c) Martin Poole\n Follow FIFO (First In, First Out) \nUse the ingredients you bought first, before opening new stuff. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way professional kitchens keep food spoilage down and help keep buying in check. This practice also helps force you to take inventory.\n Refine Your Storage \nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t find your food, you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat it. Spice stairs, turntables and refrigerator boxes keep you informed. Take realistic stock of what you have, and invest in a few storage organizers.\n Narrow Your Menu \nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever found a weird jar of fermented black beans from the 1990s in your condiment area, you know what I mean. Choose to explore only one or two cuisines at a time so you can use up the supporting ingredients. When you decide to learn how to cook Chinese food, for example, you have to buy things that are not already in your pantry, like dark soy sauce, fermented black beans and five-spice powder. If you concentrate on making several Chinese dishes over the next few months, you won\'t be stuck with leftover staples.\n Check "Sell By" and "Use By" Dates \nSome dates are about spoilage, and some are just suggestions. \xe2\x80\x9cSell by\xe2\x80\x9d dates are for the store, and you shouldn\'t be eating food past those dates. But \xe2\x80\x9cbest if used by\xe2\x80\x9d dates are about peak quality and flavor; what the manufacturer suggests will give you the optimal eating experience. These dates are often very conservative, and most foods are perfectly tasty and safe for a good while after them.\nJames Braund \xc2\xa9(c) James Braund\n Write a Shopping List \nThis may sound ridiculously obvious, but people who write lists and plan meals are more likely to buy the right ingredients, make fewer impulse buys and use up more of the food they bring home. Type out a list on your phone or scribble one on an old-fashioned piece of paper. \n Buy Less \nMore obviousness, but it\xe2\x80\x99s harder than it sounds, because stores do everything they can to encourage you to buy more. Jumbo packages of things are sometimes a bargain, but not if you are throwing some of it out because it went stale (or because two-thirds of the way through the vat, you got tired of eating it).\n Ask Your Big Batch for Some Space \nThe Sunday chili you made is more likely to entice you if you have a little distance from it. Rather than working your way through it this week, freeze some in dinner-size portions for next month.\n Embrace the Freezer Case \nThere is nothing wrong with frozen peas. Many frozen fruits and vegetables taste very good, because freezing technology can arrest their natural decline. And many fish and shrimp are frozen when caught and then thawed for sale, so you may as well skip the middleman and thaw them yourself. Freezing prevents waste by allowing farms to store some of their product. And it prevents more waste later at home, because you can use just the amount you need for a meal, without worrying about the leftovers going bad.\n Learn How to Cook \n(Disclosure: We spend most of our time trying to inspire people to cook.) The better you know how to cook, the more nimbly you can substitute one ingredient for another, which in turn will help you use up the oils, spices and staples you have on hand. Hooray for lentils instead of black beans! Cheers for the chicken whose bones have been picked completely clean, and the final few grains of rice that will be plumped in your next soup!\n'

S' BEHRAMPORE/BANKURA/ARAMBAG/MIDNAPORE: The state is yet to declare the current spate of inundation across five districts as flood, but Nabanna officials on Wednesday admitted that 10 people have lost their lives so far as heavy rains lashed the state since Friday. Besides, over 10 lakh have been affected as water gushed into villages and towns. Two went missing in Howrah as 168 villages went under water after the Damodar barrage breached at Samantapara, Batla and Monsukha. \n With thousands housed in 50 relief camps, Goghat and Chandrakona witnessed protests with victims alleging authorities were not providing relief materials to the camps. Bankura was the worst-affected. \n The government on Wednesday announced that dry food and water pouches were being supplied to relief camps along with 6,73,000 tarpaulin sheets to house the displaced. Besides, over 3 lakh dhotis, 1.7 lakh lungis and 2.49 lakh sarees have also been dispatched. With the situation raising concerns over price rise of vegetables in city markets, ministers and officials of the agriculture and agricultural marketing departments reviewed stocks of different items with the state. \n Murshidabad, Hooghly, Kolkata and West Burdwan accounted for two deaths each while West Midnapore and Nadia reported one death each. In Murshidabad, a teenager and a housewife died on Wednesday. Ronit Ghosh (13), a Class VIII student, was returning home at Bhorowan from school when he slipped into a ditch and drowned. Marjina Bibi (42) of Bagdanga died after the roof of her house collapsed. \n Chief minister Mamata Banerjee once again blamed the Centre for the flood-like situation. \xe2\x80\x9cSince 2012, I have been telling the Centre to get the DVC barrages dredged. But nothing has been done. The capacity of these barrages has declined. So, whenever there is heavy rain, water has to be released from Jharkhand, causing floods in Bengal,\xe2\x80\x9d the CM said. Later, she reviewed the situation at a meeting in Nabanna. DVC released 2 lakh cusecs of water till 3pm on Wednesday. \n   The state\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to declare floods is perhaps driven by the fact that it spent Rs 3,500 crore on flood and drought relief in 2015 all by itself with no funding from the Centre.  \n'

S'Even the cutest animals can be pests.\nA sweet little fuzzy affront to everything that New Zealand holds dear\nEvery year on Easter in the Otago region of New Zealand, people gather to shoot thousands of bunnies. A police officer is on hand, not to arrest the hunters but rather to spur them on. This is the annual Easter bunny hunt, and by the time the day is done there will be literal piles of rabbit carcasses.\nIn bunny lore, this is a ritualistic massacre. In human terms, it\xe2\x80\x99s a culling. New Zealand is overrun with rabbits, and those adorable bun-buns you may have seen perched atop sheep are no exception.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not used to thinking of something as cute as bunny rabbits as being severe pests. Deer, maybe, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not the kind of creature you want to snuggle up to. Everyone wants to hold a sweet lil bunny. Not in New Zealand, though. Rabbits are, like most mammals on the island, very real threats to the ecosystem. So are possums, deer, rats, hedgehogs, ferrets, goats, cats, and stoats, which are possibly the cutest rodents in existence. Given the threat they pose, the New Zealand government has vowed to wipe them from the islands by 2050, which feels far away until you realize how hard it must be to track down every last rat in existence. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to spread poison all over a field and get almost all of them, but what about when it\xe2\x80\x99s just a few?\nStoats look like something straight out of Beatrix Potter, except that half the pictures of them are with dead birds in their mouths\nEradication might seem a tad extreme to you, a lover of all things adorable. You almost certainly live in a country where mammals have always been a crucial part of the ecosystem. New Zealand isn\xe2\x80\x99t like that. Heck, human beings didn\xe2\x80\x99t even arrive there until around 1300, and European settlers didn\xe2\x80\x99t come barging in until the mid-1600s. The first people, Eastern Polynesians who would become the Maori, brought a kind of rat and domesticated dogs with them. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until Europeans brought all manner of other mammals that the ecosystem really took a hit.\nSee, New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem didn\xe2\x80\x99t evolve with any of these animals. Before humans showed, it was a land of birds, reptiles, and insects. Bats are only endemic mammals outside of the ocean. It\xe2\x80\x99s an island nation far enough away from any other landmass that mammals simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to it. If it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swim or fly there, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there before people arrived.\nA lot of the invasive species came over before we really understood how much damage a foreign creature could cause. The early settlers probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize what they were doing by releasing all those rabbits onto this brand new island. Possums were meant for food and fur. Deer got introduced as game animals. But when the bunny population grew out of hand, they maybe should have thought twice about introducing more invasive species to handle the problem. If there are too many of a species that has no natural predator, bringing in an animal that itself has no natural predators to eat the first species is probably going to end badly. And it did. The official policy of introducing weasels, ferrets, and stoats to control the rabbit population was not only an ineffective way of getting rid of the bun-buns, it just gave the government three more invasive species that multiplied rapidly.\nStoats are the number one threat to the famous kiwi bird. Between stoats and the other bird-hunting mammals, 51 species of bird have disappeared from the islands. There are half as many vertebrate species in New Zealand today as there were when humans first arrived. Invasive mammals eat insects and birds that previously had no predators and thus have no defense against their new hunters. Hedgehogs eat bird eggs. Ferrets eat the chicks. And those that stick to herbivorous diets wreak havoc on the plants themselves. Feral goats chomp and tamp down fields of native plants that used to sway free.\nTens of thousands of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s species of flora and fauna exist nowhere else on Earth. And the bunnies are part of the problem. Adorably riding on sheep or not, they gotta go. And if you won\xe2\x80\x99t take that from some American writer, take it from these Kiwis and their incredible accents:\nDown with the bunnies. Up with the Kiwis.\n'

S"Staff correspondent, NewsCrunch\nBody parts belonging to victims of Air India clashes over fifty years ago were discovered from the French Alps.\nAn Air India Boeing 707 from New Delhi to New York clashed at the Mont Blanc region in France in 1966. Another one from the same carrier had met the same fate in 1950. The 1966 clash killed 117 people, and 48 people died in the older one.\nAll the passengers and crew died from the crashes, but no body parts were ever discovered before in the vast freezing swathes of ice in the area.\nThe discovery was made on Thursday by Daniel Roche, reports The Hindustan Times. He is fascinated by aircraft accidents and have looked around the Bossons area for years looking for remains from the accident. Thursday was the first time he struck gold.\nThe discovery consists of an arm and a leg. It most probably belongs to the 1966 crash since one of that plane's four jet engines were also found in the area. The remains, however, could be from two different victims.\nRoche alerted the French authorities in the Chamonix valley, and the remains were carried by a helicopter to be examined by experts.\nThis is the second time in ten days when bodies lost for decades were discovered in the Alpine region.\nA 45 year old shoemaker and his wife, lost for the last 75 years, were discovered in the Swiss Alps in pristine frozen condition.\n"

S'Drivers may have lost interest in the most fuel-efficient cars because of low gasolene prices, but don\'t kick hybrid vehicles to the curb just yet.\nIn fact, their future looks more certain than ever after Swedish automotive brand Volvo announced that it would stop launching conventional gasoline engine vehicles after 2019.\nVolvo said all of its new models would be electric cars, hybrids, or mild hybrids, which are gasolene vehicles partially powered by battery-driven motors.\nDespite plummeting sales for the world\'s most popular hybrid, the Toyota Prius, and a shaky market for electric cars, Volvo is moving ahead in a real-world example of how foreign regulations are exerting more influence on the US car market.\nThe industry is still hoping that President Trump will weaken US fuel economy standards amid low gasolene prices that have undermined the appeal of fuel-efficient vehicles. That in turn has driven up demand for crossovers, sport-utility vehicles, and pickup trucks.\nBut automakers operate on a global scale and like to develop models they can sell throughout the world to spread out costs and maximise revenue. With China and European regulators pressing for fuel-efficient vehicles to combat air pollution and climate change, automakers like Volvo may have no choice but to embrace hybrids until lower battery costs make pure electric vehicles more affordable.\nAnticipation of stricter emission standards in Europe "is one of the reasons we are making this announcement," Volvo global CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in a press conference.\nVolvo is owned by Chinese automaker Geely, which is under pressure to deliver more fuel-efficient models in its home market.\n\'out of step\'\n"This is where some of the talk about going backward on the fuel economy emission standards is out of step with the rest of the world," Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said.\nFor car buyers, it could lead to a cleaner environment, but it could also lead to higher prices to accommodate the extra technology. Samuelsson declined to discuss pricing.\nBut drivers won\'t necessarily have to compromise on drive quality.\n"Hybrid technology is now mature enough that it is smooth and fuel-efficient but also can be tuned for fun and that\'s what people need to remember," AutoPacific analyst Dave Sullivan said.\nEven so, electric cars and pure hybrid vehicles aren\'t resonating for Americans right now.\nPrius sales fell 18.3 per cent in the first half of 2017 to 55,100 units. Sales of the Ford C-MAX hybrid, last year\'s second most popular pure hybrid, plunged 37.3 per cent to 4,415 in the first six months of 2017.\nPart of the problem is that hybrids evoke a certain image in the minds of consumers.\n"Everybody has a stigma when they\'re stuck behind a Prius that\'s 10 miles under the speed limit that\'s what\'s kind of ruined the view of hybrids," Sullivan said.\nBut Volvo and other automakers are trying to remake that image. The automaker said its goal is to sell one million electric or hybrid cars by 2025 and to lower its carbon footprint.\nKia recently rolled out a small hybrid crossover called the Niro, while Hyundai introduced a model called the Ioniq that will be sold in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric versions.\nGeneral Motors was the first to deliver a mass-market, long-range electric car with the Chevrolet Bolt. And Ford recently announced plans to deliver hybrid versions of the F-series pickup truck and Mustang performance car.\nAutomakers are under pressure to meet efficiency targets, particularly in Europe, where diesel vehicles are falling out of favour following Volkswagen\'s emission scandal. That event raised concerns about nitrous oxide pollutants.\nSamuelsson said Volvo will no longer develop new diesel engines. A small engine with a mild-hybrid system is "a very attractive alternative" to meet regulatory requirements, he said.\nStill, he contended that globally, people are demanding electric vehicles.\n"Electric cars are seen as very attractive cars, and we have to listen to our customers," he said.\nDon\'t wave goodbye to gasolene just yet, though. Many of the hybrid models Volvo is developing won\'t get substantially greater gas mileage than conventional engine models.\n"There are some deceptive headlines - they are not going out of the gasolene engine business, at least not anytime soon," Krebs said.\n- TNS\n'

S'James Colby, VanEck Vectors Portfolio Manager and Senior Municipal Strategist, participated in Asset TV\'s recent Muni Bond Masterclass video panel, hosted by Asset TV\'s Gillian Kemmerer. Colby joined municipal bond industry experts Terry Hults of AllianceBernstein, Suzanne Finnegan of Build America Mutual, and John Miller of Nuveen.\nJim Colby\'s comments are excerpted below.\nGILLIAN KEMMERER: Welcome to Asset TV\'s Municipal Bonds Masterclass. Municipal bonds have dominated headlines in recent months with an influx of crossover buyers and pockets of credit concern impacting the fate of the sector. Investors are grappling with a legislative agenda that could make its mark on this space, but with no sense of the timeframe in which those changes may be enacted. What does the opportunity set look like right now and what do investors need to know? Today, I am joined by a panel of experts who will share their insights.\nMuni Market\'s Evolution in the Past Decade\nKEMMERER: Let\'s start with Jim Colby. How has the municipal market changed, either in terms of composition or opportunity set, over the past few years?\nJIM COLBY: Looking back at the last 10 years, I would say that the financial crisis [2008-2010] really opened up the marketplace to new concepts and new ideas. Municipal bonds have been a tried and true performer, and a core holding in many asset models. Now we have innovation, and I\'m not just talking about derivative structures. I\'m talking about true innovative structures in the marketplace which are pleasantly, I think, offsetting in terms of where opportunities exist not only on the yield curve and the credit spectrum, but for different types of investors. We have a range of different types of fund structures from closed-end funds to UITs [unit investment trusts], to now ETFs [exchange traded funds], which is the part of the market I represent. I think we now have a collection of asset opportunities that lends itself not just domestically, but here\'s the big change, even internationally. We see interest in the municipal bond space, specifically the Build America Bonds program, which was an offshoot of the financial crisis, that has opened up a whole new venue of potential investing opportunities in Europe, in Asia, and we see that continuing.\nKEMMERER: Are you saying that the opportunities in the muni bond market in terms of fund structure have really changed?\nCOLBY: Absolutely. I mean it\'s an opportunity because the disruption of the market to some degree has created a comparative value analysis, if you will. We are not just saying here is tax exempt income to the buyer. We\'re saying, compare what they are delivering compared to corporates. Compare what they are delivering to equities over a long period of time. And these comparisons have been very favorable to munis in the past decade.\nRecent Muni Market Performance\nKEMMERER: Let\'s look at performance specifically from Q4 of last year through the first half of 2017. We saw some interesting movements in munis in response to the election. Jim, how would you characterize the past couple of quarters of muni performance?\nCOLBY: Along with the election for the Republicans in November came a concern that tax reform was in play in a big way. What impact this would have on the municipal marketplace was very uncertain. I think this led to the outflows that occurred in the municipal space, through probably the mid part of December and through the end of the year. That uncertainty was in great part mitigated by the slowness that occurred in terms of Trump\'s administration putting forth measures that would get enacted in that timeframe that he had hoped for. So with the potential of tax reform impacting munis, I think that we returned to a more orderly municipal market in the first quarter.\nKEMMERER: Interesting. It seems that munis have reacted to the slow pace of legislative growth faster than other asset classes, which might still be riding a little tail end of that wave of the election.\nCOLBY: I would say that\'s a fair analysis.\nMuni Supply Demand Dynamics\nKEMMERER: Jim, coming to you, how do you look at the demand supply imbalance in munis right now?\nCOLBY: I think it\'s very favorable for our marketplace, and it is a dynamic that we have been pointing out to our clients, and that we\'ve written about, over the last three years. And the supply demand imbalance has occurred for slightly different reasons in each year. For example, in January, one of our leading strategists in the industry did predict an enormous wave of refinancing, contributing to nearly $500 billion in terms of new issuance this year. But then I had a conversation with him at the end of the first quarter, and asked him, "Well, what\'s happened?" He said, "No refinancing." With refunding volume down, that is a big part of the supply picture. At the same time, demand is strong; it keeps reappearing in the form of new investors looking at the marketplace and looking for "relative value opportunities". And also with the amount of roll off that\'s occurring - bond calls, coupon payments, bond maturities - this month, with June 30 and July 1, for example, going to be very significant dates, there is an enormous amount of cash coming back in to client accounts for reinvestment opportunity.\nMuni Opportunities Based on the Yield Curve\nKEMMERER: Let\'s discuss market technicals. How has the shape of the yield curve changed, and what are some of the best entry points?\nCOLBY: At VanEck, we have built portfolios that are positioned to provide client opportunity for different outcomes in the marketplace. We subscribe to two key thoughts. One concerns the intermediate part of the municipal curve which is supported not only by individual investors but by substantial institutions in this country \xe2\x80\x95 they could be insurance companies, big property and casualty companies, and banks in particular. In the 7-12 year intermediate part of the curve there is a great deal of issuance and that coincides with a greater demand from those institutions. And as John was just saying, high yield has been for quite some time, on a comparable basis to corporate high yield, well above its long-term mean in terms of the nominal yield deliverable. From a technical point of view, when you do the math to represent apples to apples, taxable equivalent returns for munis versus other asset classes, are still favorable. And that\'s what drives both the intermediate part of the curve opportunities as well as high yield.\nThe GO-Revenue Bond Debate\nKEMMERER: Jim, what are your thoughts on the general obligation versus revenue bond debate?\nCOLBY: We look at the muni universe in a slightly different fashion because our management process focuses on matching up our ETF portfolios against specific indices, and an index will reflect what\'s in the marketplace. And if it\'s, say, a 65/35 division between general obligation and revenue bonds and more granular than that of course, we\'re certainly trying to do two things. Number one, we\'re trying to reflect what the index reflects. Number two, we do care about what\'s happening with Detroit, with Puerto Rico, with Illinois in particular because, as we look at what might occur two weeks or two months from now, it will have a big impact upon the structure of the index. And the index doesn\'t pay out returns, but our portfolios do. If we are even slightly overweight in a sector in a revenue situation or a GO like the State of Illinois and it drops below investment grade status, then of course we have to adjust. We do a similar analysis to manage all our ETF portfolios, but with a bit of a wait and see approach given that we are not supposed to manage proactively.\nKEMMERER: Jim, let\'s talk about Illinois. When you look at the possibility that Illinois might get downgraded, what\'s the process you go through to look at your indices and the composition or your portfolios, and re-jigger them? Will Illinois automatically go into your high yield index?\nCOLBY: Given the makeup of our high yield index, we carry triple B-rated securities, as a condition of meeting New York Stock Exchange requirements as well as the SEC, in terms of fulfilling the need for what is liquid or represents liquidity in high yield. Illinois is also part of our investment grade index, the bottom rung. As I mentioned, we\'re looking at the relative weighting in the index of Illinois GOs, of its political subdivisions. And doing our best to match up to those weightings with a hopeful eye that something positive will materialize in Springfield. Right now it is anybody\'s guess, and I am an outsider looking at the big picture. For two years now we have seen no legislative compromise to create any certainty around what the outcome will be.\nState Pension Liability\nKEMMERER: Jim, unfunded pension liability is an absolutely enormous issue in the U.S. What\'s your outlook? And is any state getting it right in a way that other states can model?\nCOLBY: That\'s a question for some very focused analysts. States, including Connecticut, New Jersey, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and now Illinois, are all laboring under intense scrutiny in a way that they have not experienced in prior years. I can remember going back some 25 years or so and hearing about the unfunded pension liabilities in some of these states. At that time, it got very little focused attention because economically states were doing well in other areas. There were revenue streams that covered up some of those issues, or legislatively the executive branches had the ability to say, "Well, all right, we\'ll set that aside for another year, allocate the money into different resources." I do think, however, that it is a grave concern when we\'re growing at less than 2% CPI year over year. Yes, there\'s job creation, but it\'s not as economically productive as it might otherwise be, which translates into slower revenue growth, which means that the POPs \xe2\x80\x95 the Pension Obligation Performers \xe2\x80\x95 are going to struggle with a lack of ready available cash in order to do what they are supposed to do internally within their own states, as well as fund their pension requirements.\nKEMMERER: Jim, what are some of the opportunities that you see right now along the yield curve?\nCOLBY: Unquestionably, the intermediate part of the curve has almost never \xe2\x80\x95 and I know as soon as I say something like this that somebody will prove me wrong \xe2\x80\x95 flattened or inverted, which means that you\'re getting the benefit by being positioned in that part of the curve of opportunity, what we call roll down. The maturity of bonds that are 10 years right now, next January are going to be 9-year bonds. All things being equal, that means some incremental performance opportunity accrues to that part of the curve. For high yield, I do think that there are opportunities that are generally not recognizable to the average investor embedded in the different sectors. The long-term profile of high yield, low default rates in the muni market, higher recovery rates when defaults do occur than in the corporate sector. And the high taxable equivalent returns compared to other asset classes really are what recommends munis.\nKEMMERER: With munis, we have tax free income, liquidity, and security. Jim, last but not least, where do munis fit into a larger investment portfolio?\nCOLBY: ETFs are a product that are relatively new on the scene, nearly 10 years old probably this September. Investors should ask, what do I need to anchor stability in my portfolio? While munis, as we discussed are clearly a preferential option, the ETF structure provide a structure that is low cost and transparent. ETFs trades on the exchange so that at any time, any moment, you can go buy $100 worth of a stock instead of spending $5,000 to buy one particular municipal bond, which is the typical trading unit for these bonds.\nKEMMERER: Thank you all for taking time to paint this really interesting picture of the municipal market. From the Asset TV studios in New York, I am Gillian Kemmerer, and this was the Municipal Bonds Masterclass.\n IMPORTANT MUNI NATION\xc2\xae DISCLOSURE \nThis content is published in the United States for residents of specified countries.

S"Walter Benjamin prophesied that man\xe2\x80\x99s self-alienation would at one point rise to a degree where he would consume his own destruction as aesthetic pleasure. There is little doubt, that a majority of our Art is created by people who alienate themselves and in turn, trying to interpret what shape or colour this negotiation between life and its purpose should take.\nIn a sense, Art is in no way devoid of a story, however plain or flat it may seem to the eye. It can at times struggle to find a language. But the clearest sign that a language does exist can be found in its disagreement with another. A mix of artists, some masters and some lesser known, together under one roof exemplifies that we need not necessarily read Art through a homogenous, universal language. Akar Prakar\xe2\x80\x99s Synchrome \xe2\x80\x94 Masters is evidence, and it brings together some of the most well known Indian artists alongside some who should be.\nS H Raza's Vinyas. From Akar Prakar's Synchrome \xe2\x80\x94 Masters\nSynchrome works like an aesthetic ambush of force. It is perhaps a visual oration of Descartes\xe2\x80\x99 philosophy of each entity entitled to a unique agency. Here in this exhibition, there are plenty. Nikhil Biswas\xe2\x80\x99 On Defeat (1965), shows a lone chariot dwarfed by the instrumental forces of nature, of mountains, of figs and trees, the sheer resplendence of colour. Biswas\xe2\x80\x99 water colours attenuate the motion of the chariot by relaying all movement, with abandon, to nature. While the colours evoke freshness, perhaps the arrival of a lively, fertile season, the chariot becomes the anchor of our reading that must point to life\xe2\x80\x99s many ironies.\nDeparting from context, Bikash Bhattacharjee channels Salvador Dali in Woman (1961). Odd, fiercely rhetoric and some would say, distinctly unpleasing, Woman is a bizarre play on shape that purveys grotesqueness as an aesthetic in itself. This mangled, morbid figure can be our view into uncivil histories like the holocaust or a clever critique of the cosmopolitanism taking over the cities, and most evidently the human form. Coming from the '60s it is perhaps reflective of a modern shift, both in our culture and living.\nIn contrast Paritosh Sen\xe2\x80\x99s untitled painting from 1992 depicts a nude woman, relieved in the company of a cold shower, the hidden joys perhaps of letting go. There is general progress here, both in our response to the period and the cultural decay of the country. In Bhattacharjee\xe2\x80\x99s work there is a prima donnish exuberance that manifests as queer and horror. Almost 30 years on, in Sen\xe2\x80\x99s painting, all that is left is cold, naked, yet personal refuge.\nSynchrome brings together a host of the masters that we have come to adore, and are still trying to grasp. From Nandalal Bose\xe2\x80\x99s bold sketches to Souza\xe2\x80\x99s minimalist nudes, to the utterly mysterious Gaitonde, there is a splash across the landscape of both the heavy and trusted hand. To stretch things, literally, to another dimension there are also sculptures by the likes of Himmat Shah and Meera Mukherjee. Shah is unique in every sense of the word. His bronze statues have always been tethered to the idea of vertical journeys. Here it is similar and represents, perhaps, the chaos of that upward movement.\nMF Husain, Watercolour on paper\nFor viewers who connect with the manipulation of light and colour from everyday life, Ganesh Haloi and Gopal Ghose embody the seamless transition into frame of things that though ordinary, give humanity its waking pledge (defending nature) \xe2\x80\x94 by leaving it out. For those in search of the eccentric, the ink and brush works of Jagdish Swaminathan would be a start. Swaminathan dissects, as if from the inside, a grotesque bird or animal. Here he perhaps inverts the quasi-optimism of a distanced view to the microscopic study of organisms that reveals something else. Is this his view of hell? That things aren\xe2\x80\x99t what they seem from a distance. In contrast, perhaps, K G Subramanyan looks from considerable distance at an ailing woman, a picture of contemplation, perhaps re-evaluating her trust in her own faith. While Swaminathan remains abreast of context, Subramanyan talks with it.\n(L) Ganesh Pyne, Untitled. (R) Nikhil Biswas, On Defeat\nSynchrome does not arrive without its challenges. While figurative energy (bodies of people and animals) lurks throughout the exhibition, and can be easily related to, there are a fair number of knee-twisting intervals that demand your attention. While some artists accentuate our interest in everything inhuman, others find a way of dissecting it through language that can be demanding. SH Raza, who only passed away in 2016, for example, deals largely with states (emotional and mental), to which his paintings usually point, while in the hands of someone like Gaitonde, these states are continually under transaction and at the mercy of a larger flux. Then there is the direct, almost digital-era, critique of Dharmanarayan Dasgupta who paints through a societal scope, at each point underlining the brutality of our choices, that only manifest when we face consequences.\nIn all, Synchrome, is both challenging and engaging. It may frustrate at times, because it asks a lot of the mind\xe2\x80\x99s reset button. But there is a renewed sense of discovery at every turn. Even if you consider yourself lost after a point, you\xe2\x80\x99d have made it to the other side.\n"

S'University of the Commonwealth Caribbean (UCC) Graduation Ceremony, 2017 at the National Arena.\n The University of the Commonwealth Caribbean (UCC) has announced new initiatives to utilise information communication technology (ICT) to deliver courses and programmes.\n Speaking on July 23 at UCC\'s commencement ceremony, Dr Winston Adams, group executive chairman of the UCC Group, said the institution had recently entered into a partnership agreement with Ready TV.\n The partnership will provide broadcasting space to UCC on Ready TVs network, which currently provides coverage to Kingston and St Andrew, parts of St Ann, St Mary and Clarendon ahead of a gradual roll out across the island.\n "We will now acquire a cable channel, which will allow us the opportunity to utilise broadcasting space to provide a variety of educational features and programmes," Adams told the gathering which included more than 700 graduands.\n He informed that UCC had recently entered into partnerships with online-on-demand course providers Coursera and EdX.\n In addition, UCC is partnering with international providers of online, on-demand short professional courses including Udemy and Cisco International. On completion of these interactive video courses, successful participants receive a certificate of achievement from the relevant university.\n NEW PARTNERSHIPS\n "We believe these new partnerships could potentially further revolutionise our tertiary education sector in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean," Dr Adams said. He noted that over the years UCC, through online programmes, has made an outstanding impact on Caribbean students including graduands from Grenada and St Vincent & the Grenadines who attended the Commencement ceremony.\n In this regard, Dr Adams announced an expansion of the range of undergraduate online offerings from six to nine degrees effective Fall 2017. The total number of undergraduate and graduate degree programmes to be offered has been increased to approximately fifty. These include UCC\'s local graduate degrees the Commonwealth Executive Masters in Business Administration (CEMBA) and Masters in Public Administration (CEMPA) which are also being offered fully online.\n'

S'A kaleidoscopic vision of the city through nine stories by various writers and artists\n  Eighteen artists and writers from the city have collaborated to come out with a graphic novel that is a tribute of sorts to the city of Bengaluru. Through nine illustrated stories conceptualized by a mix of established artists as well those just breaking into the field, the anthology portrays a vision that melds past, present and future of the city in their signature styles. \n  Speaking about the novel, Jai Undurti, creative director of a graphic novel publishing house, says, "The novel is the second part of our Every City Is A Story series, in which we try to capture the essence of a region through graphic art. The idea for Bengaluru came after our first for Hyderabad in 2014 became a hit, and we invited various artists across the city to send in their ideas. While the e-book version of this novel was released in February earlier this year, owing to a lot of request for it to be an actual book, we\'ve also brought out the hard-copy version." \n  The stories range from a variety of topics. One imagines Bengaluru 20 years from now, while another looks back at the city that was. The other elements include a fictional occult \'origin\' story, ATM theft, and more. \n  Speaking about the experience, Sreejita Biswas, who goes by the name Solo and has written the story about a vigilante operating from the roofs of Bengaluru, says, "Ojo, my junior from college, and I have been working together for a while now, coming up with graphic comics every Sunday for our webzine, which have even been published in Japan. In that respect, this has been an extension of the work we have been doing. It has been quite interesting to have contributed to a novel that is a tribute to this beautiful city." \n  Artist Appupen, whose story is the first in the novel, says, "A book of this sort has never been done for Bengaluru before. I hope people do not consider this as just a comic book for light reading, and instead spend a little more time exploring the finer aspects of our drawing and stories. A lot of thought has been put into the stories in this book, and fully experiencing will make you appreciate both the artists and the city better." \n'

S"They will not be seen as contestants, but as hosts. \nBani J and Lopamudra Raut who were a part of Bigg Boss 10 were always roped into some sort of controversy in the Bigg Boss house. It is now said that the two ladies will be a part of Bigg Boss 11 but not as participants but hosts. Yes! You heard that right, rumour has it that these two will be seen hosting small segments with the eliminated housemates. Salman who was in Morocco shooting for Tiger Zinda Hai, is back in town and is all set to shoot for Bigg Boss 11's promo on July 30th.\nSpeaking of that, recently Bani J and her boyfriend Yuvraj Thakur were spotted holidaying away to glory. The two had gone for a short vacation and had a ball of a time away from the city's splash. Bani donned a swimwear or a bikini you may call it as, while she chose to take a dip in the pool. Bani and Yuvraj are perhaps one of the most talked about couples in the television industry. Their chemistry is palpable and in fact, Bani was seen wearing Yuvraj's shirt many-a-times when she was in Bigg Boss. There were a lot of rumors of their breakup that had started doing the rounds. What really added to the rumors was the cryptic post by Bani which hinted at a possible fight between the two. However, a few weeks ago, Bani took to Instagram to share a few clicks with Yuvraj where the duo was seen spending some quality time together. \nWell, we can't wait to find out the theme for Bigg Boss 11 and watch its promo.\n"

S'Anti-terrorism raids carried out across Sydney late on Saturday thwarted an alleged plot to bring down an aircraft, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Sunday. \nTurnbull said the "major counter-terrorism operation" was ongoing and extra security measures have been put in place at major airports after four people were arrested in the Sydney raids. \n"Upon the receipt of advice from our security and intelligence agencies, the government moved swiftly in order to protect the public while operations were underway and additional security measures were put in place at Sydney airport on Thursday," Turnbull said at an early morning press conference. \n"These and further measures have been extended to all major airports at domestic and international terminals," he added. \nTurnbull said people with plans to travel should do so with confidence, but allow extra time for security screening because of the extra security. \nAustralia, a close ally of the United States, has been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters, since 2014. \nAuthorities say they have thwarted a number of potential attacks since then, but there have been several "lone wolf" assaults, including a cafe siege in Sydney that left two hostages and the gunman dead. \nAbout 100 people have left Australia for Syria to fight alongside organizations such as Islamic State, Australia\'s immigration minister said last month.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S' Aurangabad: Staying true to the verse Atithi Devo Bhava ( The guest is equivalent to God) from ancient Indian scripture, the city police\'s tourist department helped a German national reach Almora after he ran out of cash. \n Forty-Five-year-old Holger Misar from Berlin in Germany arrived in the city on Wednesday to get a treatment from a homeopath based at Osmanpura, but he soon ran out of cash. The police suspect that Misar lost cash on his way to Aurangabad and did not have money to return to Almora, a small hill station in Uttarakhand, where he had landed earlier this month. \n  To make matters worse, Misar forgot his ATM card in Almora and did not own a mobile phone. \n The foreign national requested the homeopath to share his account number, so that he could transfer some money into it with the help of a friend and withdraw the same. Much to his dismay, the doctor turned down his plea citing that the government was being harsh on unaccounted transactions in bank accounts. \n The doctor though suggested Misar to take the help of police, following which he reached Kranti Chowk police station. Police inspector Anil Adhe said, "Due to the language barrier, our men were unable to understand his issue. We then passed on the message to the control room and within minutes, the tourist police arrived at our station." \n During the interaction, the sleuths found that the tourist had run out of cash and was in need of a bank account wherein he could get some money transferred. \n Head constable Daniel Fernandes, who is the coordinator of the city polices tourism unit told TOI, "We took him to the office of the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, where we were asked to get in touch with a private tour operator." \n The tourist received another setback, when the manager at the tour operator\'s office citing vigil by the income tax department, refused to lend him the account number. \n The cops explored a few other options, but when nothing worked in their favour, Daniel with the help of his colleagues pooled some money and offered it to Misar. The tourist, after accepting the money, took the bank account number of the policeman and emailed the same to his lawyer friend in Almora from a cyber cafe. The police officials received money within the next few hours. \n Before boarding a train, he took the tourism police\'s diary and wrote, "Today to my great surprise and delight, have come in touch with the tourist police of Aurangabad, who helped me very quickly and resolved my issue completely. I am very happy about this. I could not have even imagined the existence of such service in India." \n Misar\'s lawyer friend from Almora, Shekhar Lakhchoure said, "Holger is under treatment from a Aurangabad-based homeopath. This was not his first visit to Aurangabad. He had visited the city six months back." \n'

S'Vettel and Raikkonen at the end of the qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix. (AP Photo)\n BUDAPEST: Ferrari\'s Formula One championship leader Sebastian Vettel took pole position at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday as Mercedes title rival Lewis Hamilton missed out on a record-equalling career 68th. \n The German\'s Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen sealed Ferrari\'s front row lockout, with the Italian glamour team back to their best after recent setbacks while Mercedes wondered where their previous pace had gone. \n  "The car was fantastic today, it was really a pleasure to just go around," said Vettel after taking his 48th career pole on a hot afternoon at the Hungaroring. \n His sizzling time of one minute 16.276 seconds was an absolute record for the slowest permanent circuit on the calendar. \n "Obviously the last race wasn\'t great for us but it doesn\'t matter now," added the four-times world champion, who finished seventh at Silverstone two weeks ago with a late blowout slashing his lead over Hamilton to a single point. \n Hamilton will start from a disappointing fourth place on the grid and alongside his Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas. \n The triple champion had been hoping to match Michael Schumacher\'s all-time pole record with his sixth in Hungary, a circuit where he has won five times already, and had set the fastest lap of the second phase of qualifying. \n But he had to abort his first run in the final part after running wide, complaining of vibrations to the tyres, with the pressure piled on as the clock ticked down and no margin for error. \n "We knew they were quick and we were aware of their pace. I don\'t know if they brought an upgrade but I think we did quite well considering," said the Briton. \n "You can\'t overtake here so it\'s most likely going to be a train unless we can do something on strategy." \nUPPER HAND \n Ferrari had not swept the front row in Hungary since 2004, when a dominant Schumacher led Brazilian team mate Rubens Barrichello. \n That year was also the last time anyone other than Hamilton has won at the Hungaroring from pole position and the last year in which the winner in Hungary went on to take the world championship that same season. \n "They\'ve been quick all weekend," said Bottas. "Coming to qualifying we knew it should be close and they would be tough to beat and they had the upper hand today. \n "They\'ve clearly got everything right for this track and we still have work to do in circuits like this. But let\'s see tomorrow." \n The top six places on the grid went in team order, with Red Bull\'s Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo qualifying fifth and sixth. \n Renault\'s Nico Hulkenberg was seventh, but will take a five-place penalty for a gearbox change. That will raise McLaren\'s Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne to seventh and eighth respectively. \n While one Briton had seized all the attention at the front end, another stood out at the back with Paul di Resta making his first appearance in qualifying since 2013 as a last-minute replacement for an unwell Felipe Massa at Williams. \n The Scot, who had never driven a 2017 car before and faced the monumental task of getting to grips with it in a matter of minutes, qualified an impressive 19th and ahead of Sauber\'s Marcus Ericsson. \n'

S'A new expedition of three astronauts left for the International Space Station yesterday. Space unites astronauts from different countries and nationalities. In a candid interview an Italian astronaut, Roberto Vittori, who has twice flown with Russian cosmonauts shared his experience of working with them.\nOn Friday, Vittori took part in the broadcast of the launch of the Russian Soyuz MS-05 manned spacecraft. \nIt took off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan to deliver a new expedition to the International Space Station (ISS).\nMembers of the new expedition include Russian cosmonaut Sergei Ryazanski, US astronaut Randolph Bresnik and Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli.\nRight after the launch of the spacecraft, the audience gathered in the hall of the Italian Space Agency, including Roberto Vittori who noticed a toy gnome fixed on the dashboard in front of the crew.\nVittori wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised though because he had flown with Russian cosmonauts before, once in 2002 and later in 2005.\nRussians are very connected with their own history, and they carry it with them even when flying into space, Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I flew for the first time, I did not understand why the commander of the ship, Yuri Gidzenko, got on board and hung this thing [gnome] on an elastic band. At first I thought it was a talisman, but in fact, as soon as we took off, this elastic band began to stretch \xe2\x80\x93 Russians historically used to measure acceleration in this way and of course now it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary to do this but they are very connected to their history,\xe2\x80\x9d Vittori said.\nHe added that for him it was really exciting to fly with the Russian cosmonauts.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live a story, you become a witness of what led to this great success,\xe2\x80\x9d the astronaut said.\nTalking about his personal experience, Vittori said, \xe2\x80\x9cAt first you feel a bit like an outcast, but then you discover the world of strong people and make friends for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe said that despite them being real professionals and knowing exactly what is needed to be done for a better future, Russian cosmonauts were \xe2\x80\x9cvery human and always had a direct approach which made our communication with friends and colleagues easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt present, Roskosmos cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fisher await the arrival of the new expedition onboard the ISS.\nIt is expected that the crew will spend 139 days at the station.\n'

S'  View all comments (2) \nWeekly Nifty and Bank Nifty Technical Analysis:\nNifty (Close 10014.5): This week, Nifty opened above the small consolidation band as shown in our last weekly report and continued uptrend. On Thursday, there was bearish engulfing pattern formed on hourly chart and market corrected on second half of Thursday and most part of Friday on back of that. Towards the end of Friday, Nifty bounced back almost 70 points from its intraday lows.\nNifty Hourly Technical: Nifty is just above the upward sloping trend line as shown in the hourly chart. There are two possibilities. Nifty may either obey this trend line and resume its uptrend from here, or it can break the trend line and eventually break the 100 hour moving average to extend its correction.\nOn the downside, 50 hour moving average, 100 hour moving average and 200 hour moving average should be logical support levels to look at, which presently stand at approx. 9976, 9926 and 9774 respectively.\nOn the upside, hourly mid Bollinger (presently at approx. 10025), approx. 10050 (61.8% retracement level of the present fall) and approx.10081 (approx. 80% retracement of the recent fall) should act as possible hurdles.\nHourly CCI, RSI are in neutral zone, while hourly slow stochastic is just entering in neutral zone from over sold zone. Hourly ADX is losing momentum. Overall, neutral to slightly bearish on momentum parameters. But, multiple hourly closes above the hourly mid-Bollinger line will likely negate bearishness.\nFigure: Nifty Hourly chart\nNifty Daily Technical: \nThe Nifty is Neutral to bullish in daily time frame. On the downside, supports may emerge near 13 DMA (presently at approx. 9924), 20 DMA (presently at approx.9839). There can be correction even to 34 DMA or 50 DMA, but the overall bullishness that started from December 2016, will not be altered until and unless Nifty breaks 100 DMA (presently at 9443 approx.)\nOn the upside, upper Bollinger band (presently at 10106 approx.) should act as resistance.\nDaily RSI and daily slow stochastic are in overbought zone, while daily CCI has just entered into the normal zone. ADX is neutral to bullish.\nFigure: Nifty Daily chart\nNifty Weekly Technical:\nIn weekly chart, Nifty remains firmly bullish. Weekly CCI, RSI, slow stochastic, ADX are bullish. Weekly close above 10036 (approx. 100% projection of the move from approx.6826 to approx. 8969, from Dec 2016 low of approx. 7893) will open up Nifty for higher projection targets (10542, 10855, 11108, 11361 etc.) as shown in the following weekly chart.\nFigure: Nifty Weekly Chart\nFigure: Nifty Tech table\nBank Nifty (weekly close approx. 24811.30):\nBank Nifty: \nThis week Bank Nifty continued the steady uptrend. On Thursday just before expiry there was a bearish engulfing pattern formed in hourly chart, which resulted in a corrective down move. Towards the end of the week, Bank Nifty took support near 34 hour moving average and had a minor 160-170 point bounce.\nBank Nifty Hourly Technical: The very recent up move which started from end of June has been all through very steady and supported by 34 hour moving average on the downside. This time also, Bank Nifty has bounced back from 34 hour moving average (presently at approx. 24687.7) on Friday.\nOn the downside, 34 hour moving average, and 50 hour moving average may act as probable immediate supports. \nOn the upside, 13 hour moving average (presently at approx. 24845) is the borderline between the bulls and the bears for now. Once, above that, Bank Nifty can resume its uptrend and aim for new highs.\nHourly CCI, RSI are in neutral zone, while hourly slow stochastic is just showing possibility of bottoming out. Hourly ADX is trending down.\nFigure: Bank Nifty Hourly chart\nBank Nifty Daily Technical: \nIn daily chart, Bank Nifty is bullish to neutral. Daily CCI, RSI, slow stochastic are in overbought zone and daily ADX is trending up.\nOn the down side, support may emerge at 5 DMA (approx. 24669 presently), 8 DMA (approx. 24496 presently) and 13 DMA (approx. 24271 presently).\nOn the upside, the bank Nifty can move to daily upper Bollinger line (presently at approx. 24984) or higher.\nFigure: Bank Nifty Daily chart\nBank Nifty Weekly Technical: Weekly CCI, RSI, slow stochastic, ADX are in respective overbought zones and indicating firmly bullish momentum of Bank Nifty in the weekly time frame.\nOn the downside, major weekly support remains near 8 week moving average (presently at approx. 23800).\nThe most significant point is that, Bank Nifty gave weekly close above 24775 (approx. 100% projection of the move from approx.13407 to approx. 20576 from December 2016 low of approx. 17607).

S'A number of supposed product materials detailing the Galaxy Note 8 leaked online over the weekend, having originally been discovered on Saturday. Parts of the documentation that can be seen in the gallery below contain numerous references to possible camera features of Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming phablet, in addition to adding more credence to numerous reports that claim the Galaxy Note 8 will be equipped with a dual camera setup entailing two horizontally arranged imaging sensors and a dual-LED (dual tone) flash unit on its back panel.\nOne of the supposed features of the main camera module featured on the Galaxy Note 8 is called Smart Zoom, the leaked materials indicate. This functionality is described as a 3x optical zoom that\xe2\x80\x99s additionally enhanced with software, resulting in a lossless zooming solution capable of magnifying an image while preserving both its color and details. Another notable capability of the Galaxy Note 8 mentioned in the newly uncovered materials is referred to as Refocus, with an accompanying set of images suggesting that the handset will be capable of switching focus points in an extremely quick manner. This particular feature may suggest that the Galaxy Note 8 will be equipped with a telephoto lens and a regular one given how such setups are best known for their speedy refocusing abilities, though previous reports pointed at the device having two identical camera sensors on its rear plate. The leaked documentation also mentions the Galaxy Note 8\xe2\x80\x99s Background Effect and Perspective View, two features that allow users to easily blur backgrounds in their images and even change the viewing angle of any photograph after recording it.\nThe Galaxy Note 8\xe2\x80\x99s camera sensors will be able to capture more light than those featured on the Galaxy S8 lineup, with the latest leak specifically noting how the imaging system of the device will have cutting-edge HDR support and a Super Night Shot mode. The latter allows the device to capture a significantly larger volume of light in a given period compared to single-lens solutions, allowing for efficient mobile night time photography. The Galaxy Note 8 is scheduled to be officially unveiled on August 23 before hitting the market at some point in September, Samsung previously confirmed.\n'

S'CARACAS (Reuters) - In a portend of steepening inflation in crisis-stricken Venezuela, money supply surged 10 percent in just one week earlier this month, its largest single-week rise in a quarter of a century. \nVenezuela is undergoing a major economic crisis, with millions suffering food shortages, monthly wages worth only the tens of U.S. dollars, and soaring inflation -- though no official data is available. \nThe central bank said late on Friday the total amount of local currency in circulation -- known as M2 by economists - as of July 21 was 27.3 trillion bolivars, up 9.66 percent from the previous week. \nIn October 1992, the figure rose 10.84 percent in a single week. \nThe exponential rise in M2, the sum of cash, together with checking, savings, and other deposits, means an exponential rise in the amount of currency circulating. Venezuela\'s money supply is up 384 percent in the last year. In contrast, the United States\' money supply is up 5.5 percent in the same period. \nCoupled with a decline in the output of goods and services, that has accelerated inflation. \nWhile M2 may seem an obscure technical indicator, the figure was routinely published by newspapers in Venezuela, whose oil-dependent economy has been dogged by inflation in the past. \nVenezuelans are forced to carry huge bundles of cash to make basic purchases - if they can afford to do so given weekly price rises on many goods. \nThis week also saw Venezuela\'s black market exchange rate surge past 10,000 bolivars per dollar. \nWhen President Nicolas Maduro came to power in April 2013, it was at 24 per dollar. \nA thousand dollars worth of local currency then would be worth just over $2 now. \nMaduro says he faces an "economic war" waged by the opposition and Washington. \nThe last year for which official inflation data is available from the central bank is 2015, when consumer prices rose 181 percent. \n'

S"From Monday to Friday, our hectic daily work schedule does not leave us with any time to pay extra attention to our skin and hair. Now, when the weekend comes, there is some extra time in hand and that can definitely be spent on taking care of the beauty requirements of the body.\nBeauty requirements of the body include taking care of both the hair and skin. It is during the weekends that you can try to do all possible skin and hair beauty treatments, such that by Monday you end up looking fabulous and throughout the week, you don't put on a dull look.\nSo that you can use well all the extra time that you get during the weekend in properly taking care of yourself, here is a list of skin and hair care to-dos that you must try to add in your weekend routine. Doing these skin and hair beauty treatments during the weekend will let you look your best during the entire week. So, go ahead and take a look.\nSkin Exfoliation\nSkin exfoliation is not an everyday activity. Yet, you should be regular in exfoliating your skin. Skin exfoliation takes time and during weekdays, you might not invest so much in doing that. During weekends, how about using the time to exfoliate your skin with a gentle scrubber? You can use mild scrubber from the nearest beauty shop or prepare one homemade scrubber to do this.\nSalon Time\nThe hectic weekdays do not allow us to land up in the salon or spend time there. So, how about booking an appointment during the weekend? Some skin and hair pampering at the salon during the weekend will revitalize you for the coming week. In the salon, you can go for treatments and services, depending on the present condition of your skin and hair.\nHair Massage And Masks\nWeekdays are all about those quick hair wash sessions right before going to work. Your hair needs much more than that. So on the weekend, use the extra time in hand for some good hair massage and follow this by applying a good hair mask. This is not only pampering but it makes your hair ready to bear all the dust and pollution, yet not give up during the week.\nMilk Bath\nHow about a special bath during the weekend? Preparing milk bath is really special during weekends if you have all the right ingredients. Along with milk, you will need some honey, rose petal and Epsom salt. Going for a milk bath is rejuvenating for your entire body. Ensure you let your body enjoy and feel the milk all over and do not rush in that process.\nBody Massage or Spa\nThe constant hecatombs of the week make the body tired and fatigued. Get over the pain, with a body spa or body massage. You can schedule your body spa or massage at the salon. These days, professionals also come home to deliver such services right at your doorstep. Doing this prepares you for the coming week and is also very relaxing.\nNail Care\nNow, during the weekend, when you are spending time on the skin and hair, how about spending some time on your nails as well? Men can clean the nails, trim them, file them and also go for some pedicure and manicure sessions. Along with pedicure and manicure, women can plan a good nail colour or nail art that they can carry all along the week. This will also remove existing dirt and dust on your nails, making it feel clean.\nEye Care\nEyes are indeed soft and a special part of the body. Its beauty routine is very different from all your body parts. Eye care, during the weekend, is especially important for those with dark circles or eye bags. While doing this, ensure you use ophthalmologist-verified products alone.\n"

S" Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was tapped to take over as interim Prime Minister till Shahbaz is elected to Parliament \nIslamabad: The PML-N on Saturday decided to rally behind ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, as his eventual successor, while party leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was tapped to take over as interim Prime Minister till Shahbaz is elected to Parliament.\n Shahbaz's ascension to the Prime Minister's office was considered to be a foregone conclusion, as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) continues to hold a hefty majority in Parliament and can independently vote him into office.\n He will also likely seek election to the National Assembly from Nawaz Sharif's vacated seat, which was a PML-N stronghold, Dawn reported.\n Shahbaz will have to forego his seat in the Punjab Assembly, and a new Chief Minister to the province will need to be chosen.\n Sources claim that Punjab Excise and Taxation Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman was likely to replace Shahbaz as the Chief Minister.\n The names of Shahbaz and Abbasi, the Petroleum Minister, were finalised in two separate meetings, one informal and the other involving the PML-N's parliamentary committee. The meetings were attended by close aides of Nawaz Sharif, including Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Ahsan Iqbal, Ayaz Sadiq, Saad Rafique, Rana Tanveer, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Shahbaz Sharif along with other members of the PML-N's leadership.\n The meetings came as the PML-N deliberated its political and legal options after Sharif's disqualification and decided on who would take over the party's reins in Parliament. \n"

S"The world is shrinking by the day, I get convinced almost daily, reacting to the intriguing requests for information I get from unknown people. The latest is from Swasti Bharti, from Gandhinagar, who is tracking Wiele & Klein, or Klein & Peyerl, if you wish. She wanted more to their story than what I\xe2\x80\x99d written in several places. I could add little. Then she came up with a googly. Had I heard of Del Tufo & Co? Sadly, neither I nor any other Madras expert had heard of it. But she was a better miner than us; she dug up an article written by Ismeth Raheem, a collector of old photographs in Colombo. He had discovered three 19th Century women photographers in Ceylon and one owned Del Tufo & Co., \xe2\x80\x98artists and photographers\xe2\x80\x99 in Colombo who had studios in the 1880s-90s in Bombay, Bangalore, Ooty, and Mount Road, Madras. \nInez Maria Gibello (1876-1952) was born in Kutch, daughter of an Italian merchant and married Innocenzo del Tufo in 1895. They are next heard of in Colombo, setting up c.1900 a photographic studio that proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cPhotographers by special appointment to the King of Italy\xe2\x80\x9d. Besides photographing clients, they offered developing and printing services, \xe2\x80\x9cenlargements of all sizes from amateur negatives\xe2\x80\x9d, hand-finishing black and white pictures with pencil and water colours, and a carpentry department that offered to repair the cameras of the day which had part-wooden bodies and came with wooden tripods. \nThe firm became \xe2\x80\x98Madam Del Tufo\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x9cArtist, photographer and proprietress\xe2\x80\x9d in 1914 and vanished from the South Asian scene by 1930. During this period, it focused on family groups and portraits of the elite. Little is known of Madam\xe2\x80\x99s life thereafter, except that she died in 1952. Can any history buff in the Photographic Society add to this?\nThe second of Ismeth Raheem\xe2\x80\x99s women photographers was Julia Margaret Cameron, born in Calcutta in 1815 and married Charles Hay Cameron of the Indian Law Commission in 1838, a Spring-Autumn marriage. Cameron was one half of the Cameron-Colebrook Commission that in 1832 proposed reforms in governance in Ceylon. After his retirement, they spent time in England, then came to live on their estates in Ceylon where her photographic portraiture flourished till her death in 1879.\nThe third woman photographer had even more tenuous but even more intriguing connections with India. Ethel (Partridge) Coomaraswamy, born in 1872 in the UK, married Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy in 1902. Is there anyone in the art world in India who has not heard of Ananda Coomaraswamy, the Jaffna Tamil geologist who became the 20th Century authority on South Asian Art? \nWhen he became the first Director of the Mineralogical Survey of Ceylon, she photographed all the arts and crafts they found while travelling around the Island. \nThen, together they brought out in 1908, after returning to England, Coomaraswamy\xe2\x80\x99s first major book, Medieval Sinhalese Art. Hers were the photographs, the contribution on music and the detailed descriptions of the handicrafts. The designing and printing of this classic was done in their home-based workshop in Gloucestershire. Soon after this, they divorced. She was the first of his four wives. \nI was intrigued by her maiden name, not a very common one. Oakes & Co. in Madras once had a Partridge in its name, undoubtedly a partner. Better-known was advocate PW Partridge of King and Partridge who with Buchi Babu was a \xe2\x80\x98father of Indian Cricket in Madras\xe2\x80\x99. \nIn 1907, they led the \xe2\x80\x98Whites Only\xe2\x80\x99 Madras Cricket Club and the \xe2\x80\x98Indians only\xe2\x80\x99 Madras United Club against each other at Chepauk. Partridge needs an item of his own one day, but meanwhile were either of these Partridges connected with Ethel Partridge Coomaraswamy?\nWhen the postman knocked\xe2\x80\xa6\n \xe2\x80\x98Lighthouse-man\xe2\x80\x99 DH Rao wonders when my picture of the High Court buildings (Miscellany, July 3) was taken by Klein or Peyerl as it does not show the lighthouse in its tallest tower? \nThese buildings were built between 1889 and 1892. The lighthouse was inaugurated in 1894. Was the picture then taken in 1892 or 1893, making it one of the oldest in the Vintage Vignettes Collection?\n Also referring to the High Court story, Bhaskarendra Rao tells me the Madras City Civil Courts were also 125 on July 12, being instituted that day. He adds that the CCC\xe2\x80\x99s Silver Jubilee was celebrated on December 1, 1917 and that TR Srinivasa Iyer, appointed the first Shirastedar (Chief Indian Court Officer) on the day the court opened, was also felicitated for his 25 years of service.\n Krishna Palle wonders whether he and his family, resident on Eldam\xe2\x80\x99s Road (Miscellany, February 1, 2016) are the oldest residents of the road. He is the fifth generation living on the road. His ancestor Rajtantra Pravina Palle Chentsal Rao, the first Registrar-General of Madras, bought a 13-acre property here. Later, one part was sold to CP Ramaswami Aiyar for The Grove, another to Janab Sulaiman Sait, and the family kept the third part. Palle adds that his maternal great-grandfather Nyapathi Subba Rao Panthulu was one of the \xe2\x80\x98'Triplicane Six\xe2\x80\x99 who founded The Hindu. He was also the first mayor of Rajahmundry (now Rajamahendravaram). His statue near the Collector\xe2\x80\x99s office was unveiled by The Hindu\xe2\x80\x99sthen Editor-in-Chief N Ram a couple of years ago. \nThe chronicler of Madras that is Chennai tells stories of people, places, and events from the years gone by, and sometimes, from today\n"

S'Scientists at the University of London are developing a new high-tech brand of cutlery that could seriously curb your salty and sweet cravings. Taste Buddy is an electronic spoon that works to trigger your taste buds with a light electrical current so that your brain thinks you\'re indulging . . . even if you\'re eating something that is really quite bland.\nThe futuristic spoon was just recently unveiled at a science and engineering conference for young people in the UK. Professor Adrian Cheok is helping the University of London students develop the product and recently spoke to The Telegraph about it. He said, "Many children hate the taste of vegetables. So I knew that when I became an engineer, I wanted to make a device that could allow children to eat vegetables that taste like chocolate."\nConceptually it sounds like a great idea, but how will it work? Dr. Cheok explained that savory flavors will be triggered once the saliva detects any acidity or sodium. Sweet flavors, however, have proven to be trickier. Surprisingly, sweetness is detected more when said sweet is hotter, not colder. To stimulate your sweet tooth then, the spoon will increase the temperature of your tongue to mimic that temperature change that happens naturally when you eat sweets.\nAt the moment, the device does sound a little far-fetched, but if it works, it could completely change the way we eat. As Dr. Cheok said, "The Taste Buddy could eventually help save lives, by allowing people to switch to healthier food choices."\n'

S"With Microsoft Paint in the news over the possibility of being phased out, graphic artists speak of their first experience of using the programme\nIllustration/Ravi Jadhav\nRuchita Madhok\n32, graphic designer\nI think Paint is as old as I am! [laughs] I was eight when I first used it on my mother's computer. We didn't even have a colour monitor. So, I painted in all shades of grey. It was the only drawing software I had access to before design school. My brother and I used it for school projects and study charts. My mother would take printouts of our creations and put them up on the soft board. The reason why people connected with Paint is because it was simple but capable of so much. It was the first brush for many aspiring designers. I never mastered it, but knew of someone who rendered such incredible car designs in Paint for his admission at NID [National Institute of Design]. They looked Photoshopped!\nAbhijeet Kini\n34, illustrator, animation artist\n[The first time I used Paint] I drew a tree! Although it looked like cr*p, I could finally see my work on screen and it was amazing. Nothing can replace that experience. I first used it in high school or early college years. The simplicity of it, and the fact that it was the first fun app on a boring looking operating system, is what makes it special.\nSanket Avlani\n30, graphic designer\nI was probably part of the first generation to own a personal computer and even then, most households didn't have one. Graphic artists have moved on to Apple now but back then, a Mac was a luxury. I must have been in the fourth or fifth standard when I first used Paint. In the life of a designer, it was the first illustrating programme. I used to draw on Paint, export the file and create animations on Powerpoint slides. For me, it's the best programme Microsoft has made. The initial tools had a distinct identity and set a benchmark for future software.\nSameer Kulavoor\n33, illustrator, visual artist\nA 'computer period' in school meant 10 students on 10 machines. The teacher would teach DOS, which I was never inclined towards. I would always cover up for it by making a flower or something on Paint and show off. Even the teacher seemed okay with it. Everyone between Generation X and the millennials would have some experience of using Paint; especially an artist, for whom, it was the first introduction to digital art.\n"

Finance Ministry officials informed that Patel also met the new Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.\nThe six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) of the RBI headed by Patel will meet on August 1-2 in Mumbai for the third bi-monthly policy review of the fiscal in the backdrop of latest macro data strengthening the case for an interest rate cut by the central bank.\nRetail inflation in June dropped to a record low of 1.54 per cent, while industrial production data showed that the growth in factory production fell to 1.7 per cent in May, from 8 per cent in the same month a year ago.\nAt its second bi-monthly monetary policy review of the fiscal on June 7, the Reserve Bank of India maintained status quo on its repo, or short-term rate for lending to commercial banks, at 6.25 per cent. In doing so, the policy statement said the six-member MPC was guided by the risks to inflation.  \nLast month, Patel told reporters here that the MPC had turned down the Finance Ministry's invite for a discussion ahead of the panel's policy review meeting.\nSince the six-member MPC started setting rates in October last year, this was the first time it did not take a unanimous decision, with five members voting in favour of holding the rate and one opposing. Three of the six members of the MPC are government nominees, while the others are from the RBI.\n"

Elated by this response, makers have now announced the exciting news on Paisa Vasool release date.\nPaisa Vasool will be releasing worldwide on September 1. Earlier they have announced the release date to be September 29 but now they have pulled the release date to September 1.\nThis is something that rarely happens in Tollywood when a release date is preponed. Generally we see delays happening with the original release date but for Paisa Vasool it\xe2\x80\x99s altogether a different story. Not only Nandamuri fans, this is something that has to rejoiced within industry circles.\nWith Paisa Vasool scheduled for arrival on September 1, there will be enough time gap with Jr NTR Jai Lava Kusa.\nLikewise, if Spyder is aiming at September 27 release, it will be nice to see if Jai Lava Kusa releases in mid of September. We will then have a two week gap between all these three biggies, a win-win situation for all of them.\n'

S'Amaravati, Jul 29 (PTI) NDA\xe2\x80\x99s vice presidential candidate Venkaiah Naidu today rubbished \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah named him for the top post as they feared that he would be a contender for the PM\xe2\x80\x99s post in 2019.\nDubbing these claims as mere \xe2\x80\x9ctrash\xe2\x80\x9d, Naidu heaped praise on Modi, saying he was \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s boon to the country\xe2\x80\x9d and that decisions were always taken collectively.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is trash. Modi, Shah and we all take decisions collectively. In fact they both used to consult me on all important matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Naidu said at a \xe2\x80\x98meet-and-greet\xe2\x80\x99 programme here today.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the President of India is from the north, prime minister from the west, Lok Sabha speaker from central India, Modi wanted the vice president from the south,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe also wanted one from an agricultural family for the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s post. And, one who could run the Rajya Sabha effectively. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s thinking was rational,\xe2\x80\x9d Naidu said.\nThe prime minister had clearly said there was no alternative (for the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s post) and so he was chosen, the former Union minister said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither out of their liking for me or disliking of others, some people started all this talk that I\xe2\x80\x99m set to be a competitor (for Modi) in 2019 and hence they (Modi and Shah) tactfully removed me (from active politics) and nominated me for the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s post,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome say Amit Shah conspired against me. Why should he do that? Shah, Modi and we all take decisions collectively,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\xe2\x80\x9cModi is God\xe2\x80\x99s boon to the country. He has character, calibre and capacity and he has been tirelessly and dedicatedly working for the development of India. He is a leader par excellence,\xe2\x80\x9d Naidu said.\nNaidu, a former BJP chief, also praised Shah saying that with his political acumen and determination, he has been toiling to strengthen the BJP in all parts of the country.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe BJP once used to be known as a north Indian party but now almost the entire north east is under its fold. Even in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the BJP has an MP, Zilla Parishad chairman and municipal chairman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nState ministers, MPs and former MPs were among those who attended the event and felicitated Naidu for being chosen as the candidate for the high post.\nNaidu is pitted against Gopalkrishna Gandhi who is the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s vice presidential candidate. Poll to the post will be held on August 5.\n'

S"A new study claims that there is a huge drop in the sperm levels of men in the past 4 decades. This news is alarming to all men!\nWell, researchers came to this conclusion after studying more than 42000 men! The drop is around 60%. This means that the sperm count of today's men has dropped around 60%!\nIf you are a man who is unable to impregnate your partner, then you must read about the results of this study. Here are they.\nAre Sperm Counts Dipping?\nThere were a lot of debates about the declining sperm counts since the past few decades. Some say they have not dipped whereas many researchers who have concrete proof claim that men's fertility levels are declining nowadays.\nData Comparision\nThe latest study confirmed that its true that most of today's young men are suffering low fertility levels. The results of the latest study which compared the sperm count of today's men and men of the previous generation are reliable.\nWhat Caused This?\nWhat could be the reason behind this? Well, reproductive health of men is seemingly dipping now and a raise in the cases of testicular cancer is also another disturbing fact.\nWhat If This Continues?\nIf this falling reproductive rates continue till 2060, a day might come when men have very little reproductive capacity, says this study.\nIs Pollution The Reason?\nFirstly, the changing environmental conditions are contributing to the falling fertility rates. Men's reproductive fluids are vulnerable to certain environmental pollutants.\nWhat Researchers Say?\nResearchers say that a lot more needs to be studied to pin point the exact reason why men are unable to retain their sperm counts till their old age.\nDo Chemicals Damage Sperm?\nMen may need to avoid exposure to chemicals like bisphenol which hit fertility. Also, smoking is responsible for damaging the sperm apart from obesity. So men may need to take the necessary precautions to retain their fertility levels.\n"

S'Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said on Friday.\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\nAnother Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n"They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\n'

S'25 Things You Need to Know to Happily Travel the World'

S"The idea of traveling the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be some type of romantic notion just for the free-spirited. People of all ages and from all backgrounds have taken on their bucket lists with gusto and are traversing the world to get a broader perspective on life.\nTravel bestows a new appreciation for cultures and humanity and lends a glimpse into the life and ways of others on this planet. As the world becomes closer than ever and many restrictions have been lifted by various countries, there is no time like the present to globe trek.\nHere are 25 things to keep in mind about traveling the world that can convince you to get started and make it easier and more cost-effective:\n1. Your papers, please.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s actually easier than you think to get or renew a passport in the U.S. in just 24 hours. When we relied on paper processes to get things done, it would be next to impossible to get a passport issued so quickly. However, the digital age has sped up most every type of transaction, including passport issuance. Online passports and eVisa services like Fastport Passport help you get on your way even when you decide at the last-minute to visit a foreign country.\n2. Exchange programs.\nStart with work exchange programs that cover the cost of traveling while providing you first-hand experience working on a local level. Not everyone wants to do the tourist approach to travel, so participating in a work exchange program offers a way to become part of the local color while having your travel costs covered. The other advantage is that these programs make you feel as though you are doing some good on a social level, plus you can gain valuable experience to apply toward your career back home. Start your search with organizations like HelpX or Workaway.\n3. Volunteering.\nIf you are looking for an enriching experience, volunteer while you are on a trip. Organizations in many countries will accept short-term volunteers for various projects. You can look online in advance of your trip or contact volunteer groups when you arrive.\n4. Learning abroad.\nWith more universities and colleges accepting international students, you can also study abroad as a way to travel to other parts of the world. It's not as expensive as you would think and is sometimes even cheaper than attending an institution of higher learning in the U.S. This makes it possible to travel the world and get your degree at the same time. Sites like Study Abroad can make this a reality.\n5. No currency hassles.\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to deal with travelers\xe2\x80\x99 checks or currency exchange in most countries because of a more global banking system that lets you use debit and credit cards for most transactions. With the growing global acceptance of plastic payments and the migration to EMV (chip-enabled) credit and debit cards, you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel more confident with payments and not worry about having checks or cash misplaced or stolen. There are ATMs and POS systems in stores all over the world -- even in the most remote places. Smartphones and smartphone readers are changing commerce for all countries.\n6. Cheap flights.\nYou can purchase an around-the-world ticket that is open ended and a much better value than if you buy a separate flight ticket to each location that you might visit. This provides you with more flexibility to change your itinerary and stay longer in one place or alter your future destination. There are some limitations to keep in mind, including the fact that you would have to complete your travel within one year and only travel in one direction rather than backtracking. Use this ticket for country-to-country travel, and rely on local country airlines for shorter trips.\n7. Hotels are expensive and boring.\nThere are so many other options for accommodations besides hotels. Hostels are not just for students anymore. Plus, you can now use services like Airbnb nearly anywhere in the world to rent a room, apartment or even a house, depending on your needs, budget and length of stay. Your money will go farther, and you'll have a better travel experience. \n8. Rest insured.\nTravel insurance is an excellent decision for any trip because it provides a safety net for when things go wrong, especially if you have a medical emergency or your belongings are stolen.\n9. Skip the tours.\nYou most likely will see and learn more by not doing guided tours. While some people like to go in directed group tours to see the sights, seasoned global travelers will tell you that the experience is enhanced when you self-guide your way through destinations. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to ask locals where they would go for a meal or a day out. Most of the travel books and websites won\xe2\x80\x99t know about these hidden gems.\n10. Go local.\nUse local street markets and stores to eat for cheap, but be cautious of the conditions, and use your common sense in regards to what may be safe and what looks unsanitary. You can also visit local grocery stores for food rather than rely on restaurants where you will get far less for your money. Many countries have joined apps like Yelp so you can be sure to find street markets and shops that have been recommended by fellow travelers.\n11. Travel light.\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to pack your closet to go on a global trip. Take very little because you can purchase local clothing to acclimate and look less like a tourist. Many accommodations also offer washers and dryers so you can regularly clean your clothes.\n12. The power difference.\nA voltage converter will be the smartest purchase you can make for traveling around the world. Many novice travelers don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that they can\xe2\x80\x99t just take their power cords and hair dryers along and plug them directly into the wall wherever they land. Various countries use different voltage as their standard versus what is used in the U.S. Amazon and other retailers sell all types of voltage converters that offer numerous conversion options and include a way to plug in multiple devices at once.\n13. A world of phones.\nCheck whether your carrier will provide you with an international plan for the various countries you are visiting. Not every country will just let you use your smartphone on their network. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to plan ahead and determine what works in each locale. You may be able to find WiFi, rent a phone, buy a disposable phone, or rent or buy a hotspot. It may be a combination of those things, but planning ahead helps you remain accessible.\n14. Most places have a deal.\nLook for discount sites that offer reductions in the price of attractions and the sights. In Europe, there are apps available, similar to Groupon, that offer ways to save money. The London Pass is a prime example of a way to save significant amounts of money on some of the tourist activities you may want to do.\n15. Ignorance won't be bliss.\nThere is still risk to traveling abroad. Local scams and cultural issues could create conflict between you and those you are visiting. Take the time to study about the places you are visiting and determine the risks. You can check U.S. government websites on travel restrictions or warnings. Also, don\xe2\x80\x99t be the typical tourist lost in their map books and phones. Stay alert about your surroundings. Know where you can get assistance, including the local embassy for your country.\n16. Follow your phone.\nGoogle Maps will be another one of your best friends -- after the voltage converter. Rather than carrying those huge fold-up maps that scream tourist to everyone around you, be sure to have Google Maps downloaded on your phone to help you navigate as much as possible. Those around you will only see you looking down at your phone, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t stick out.\n17. Backup everything important.\nBackup all your data and information, including keeping digital copies of your passport, health cards, birth certificate and other vital records. Thanks to cloud storage, even if your electronic device that stores this information gets stolen, you can still get to these copies while in a foreign country to if needed during an emergency. These cloud storage solutions can be accessed from anywhere to help you out.\n18. Be stoic.\nLife will be different than what you are accustomed to, including having to go without some of the creature comforts you enjoy at home. Don\xe2\x80\x99t complain or make a deal about this. Remember the idea here is to go experience something outside of your comfort zone and immerse yourself in another way of life. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s just temporary and it might just help you to appreciate your life a bit more or change your perspective on what\xe2\x80\x99s really important.\n19. Stay loose with your schedule.\nThe best experiences are likely to be the ones you didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan. While some people develop complex itineraries down to an hour-by-hour activity description, traveling around the world just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work that way. Transportation and people in other countries operate on a different sense of time that typically is not predictable or consistent. Step away from planning everything, and go with it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have some of the best memories from the trip this way.\n20. The germs are foreign, too.\nYou may need more vaccinations than you would if staying at home. Many countries have other diseases that are uncommon in the U.S. That means you need further protection to avoid getting ill while traveling or upon returning home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to make an appointment with your physician and discuss where you plan to travel to so they can update your vaccinations and potentially provide any medications that might help you. This saves discomfort and cost later on.\n21. The embassy is your friend.\nRegister with your embassy before leaving the country so they can contact you via email, phone or text if there is a political situation that requires you to immediately seek safety. This can provide a way for safe passage in case anything should happen. With ongoing terror attacks, this is very important.\n22. Money ups and downs.\nThe conversion rates in different countries fluctuate and can significantly alter the cost of anything you buy. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to look at the price of something in a foreign country and conclude it\xe2\x80\x99s cheap, but you need to familiarize yourself with the exchange rate because it could be costing you twice the amount it says. You can download currency exchange apps like XE to help you know the price you will really pay in your own currency.\n23. Your body is far from home.\nYour body will get a workout from the time changes and the act of traveling, so be sure to treat it well. Your body clock may not be able to keep up, but try to stick to a routine as much as possible. Do things that help your body recover from the shock of time changes by getting as much sleep as possible, focusing on healthy food choices, using sunscreen, staying active and drinking a lot of water.\n24. Take the bus. Or train.\nPublic transportation is often easier, but different than you may be accustomed to. In the U.S., not every state has great transportation options, but even developing countries offer a fairly accessible system to get you from point A to point B. Make sure you consider all those options rather than just seeking out a way to rent a car. You may not want to attempt driving on the opposite side of the road than you are used to or navigating different routes and busy city roads.\n25. You'll want to go again.\nOnce you start traveling the world, you will have the bug and won\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop doing it. This type of experience will forever change how you see life and will alter your priorities. While you may not believe it, everyone who has ventured to various countries comes back with plans for their next trip. You will too!\nNext Article\n15 'RegTech' Investors Every Fintech Startup Needs to Know\nSerenity Gibbons\n"

S'Cop and a Half 2 Trailer: Best or Worst Movie of the Year?'

S'Kevin Burwick 07.29.2017\nHenry Winkler\'s Cop and a Half showed up in theaters in April 1993, forever changing the landscape of the buddy cop genre. And now, 24 years later, the sequel Cop and a Half: New Recruit is finally here to retain some of the glory of that first movie. The original starred Burt Reynolds as Lieutenant Nick McKenna, a grizzled veteran cop who gains an unlikely partner, 8-year old Devon Butler (Norman D. Golden II). 8-year old Butler witnessed a murder and goes to the police to give them information, but here\'s the kicker: Butler won\'t reveal any information until he is made an official policeman. Hilarity obviously ensues when Butler is paired with Reynolds\' McKenna character.\nCop and Half: New Recruit recently released a trailer in a quiet fashion, which is strange because you think they\'d be taking out billboards and skywriters to promote this soon to be classic. The new trailer comes to us courtesy of Universal Pictures Home Entertainment\'s official YouTube channel and this time around Lou Diamond Phillips (La Bamba) is playing the grizzled, old veteran detective, stepping into Burt Reynolds\' shoes, a task that one should never take lightly. The 12-year old half cop is played by Lulu Wilson (Ouija: Origin of Evil).\nCop and Half: New Recruit is set to be released next week in a straight to video release and will not see a theatrical release of any type, which is a shame because it would be pretty awesome to see the drones from the trailer shooting the popcorn in full resolution HD. But unfortunately, it\'s just not meant to be and we should feel pretty lucky that the movie exists at all in the first place especially a movie starring Lou Diamond Phillips. The over acting and zany hijinks offer a refreshing take on the buddy cop genre.\nThe original Cop and a Half came out to mixed reviews back in 1993. Film critic Leonard Maltin said that movie was "abjectly painful" while going on to add "a hemorrhoid-and-a-half to anybody who sits through it." However, Siskel and Ebert were far more forgiving, giving the movie 3 out of 4 stars, praising the performance of Norman D. Golden II, saying that he gave a "winning performance." Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin was originally approached as was Kurt Russell, but that duo ultimately didn\'t work out in the end.\nHere it is, ready or not, Cop and Half: New Recruit full of drones, new technology, and Lou Diamond Phillips. This new version of the movie needs to be shared and viewed as many times as possible to let Universal know that there is a demand for a sequel to Cop and a Half and other straight to video releases like Kindergarten Cop 2 starring Dolph Lundgren. Anyway, the movie hits the shelves or streaming services on August 1st, 2017 and in the meantime, you can check out the official trailer below.\n'

S'Galle: India captain Virat Kohli feels that all-rounder Hardik Pandya has all the skill sets required to emulate world\'s premier all-rounder Ben Stokes. "I have a lot of faith in him (Hardik) as far as any format is concerned. If he grows in confidence you see someone like Ben Stokes, what he does for England, brings in great balance as an all-rounder. I see no reason why Hardik Pandya can\'t become that for India," Kohli said at the post- match press conference.\nFile photo\nKohli singled out Pandya for special mention, praising his second innings bowling apart from his debut half-century. "In the first innings, he didn\'t get opportunity to bowl much but I think in the second innings, he bowled really nicely on a wicket that wasn\'t offering much and he kept it in the right areas," said Kohli.\n The skipper was impressed as to how Pandya used the shirt ball and also the speed at which he bowled. "He used the bouncer well. He bowls around 135, so he is a great asset and I have mentioned this before as well," he said.\n His whirlwind 50 in the first innings was the difference between a total of 550 and 600. "We would have been 540-550 in the first innings. He got those 50 runs quickly and that saves you time as well. That gives you another 15 overs to bowl at the opposition. And his fielding is also tremendous." \n'

S' The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that the Chinese yuan\'s exchange rate is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies.\n "The yuan, despite moving closer to the level consistent with overall assessment, remained broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies," said the IMF in its latest External Sector Report released on Friday.\n According to the report, in 2016, the average real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by about 5.1 per cent compared to 2015, reflecting in part the strengthening of the US dollar, reports the People\'s Daily.\n China\'s policies that were put in place to stabilise the growth has led to the yuan\'s appreciation and helped ease capital outflows and foreign exchange reserve loss, Luis Cabeddu, IMF research department\'s division chief said at a press briefing on Friday.\n China\'s current account surplus declined to 1.7 per cent of GDP in 2016, falling substantially from its peak of about 10 per cent of GDP in 2007, the People\'s Daily quoted the IMF report as saying.\n The IMF expected that China\'s current account surplus will continue to be narrowed if the country continues to implement reforms.\n Despite the declines in foreign exchange reserves in 2015 and 2016, the IMF estimated that China\'s current level of forex reserves to be adequate.\n The IMF warned that China may face potential risks of protectionist policies by its key trading partners in the future.\n --IANS ksk/vm\n( 244 Words)\n'

S"New York: A Russian Soyuz MS-05 carrying the three new crew members to join the Expedition 52 docked to the International Space Station (ISS) after a six-hour spaceflight, to continue important scientific research in the orbiting laboratory, NASA said in a statement. NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik, Sergey Ryazanskiy of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and Paolo Nespoli of European Space Agency (ESA) launched aboard the Soyuz MS-05 at 11.41 a.m. on Friday from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.\nRepresentational Image\nThe three crewmates aboard the Soyuz MS-05 spacecraft orbited Earth four times, before docking at the space station. \n Their arrival restored the station's crew to six people, which includes Expedition 52 Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin of Roscosmos and Flight Engineers Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer of NASA. \n The new Expedition 52 crew members will spend more than four months conducting approximately 250 science investigations in fields such as biology, Earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development.\n The expedition team is expected to soon conduct new science investigations arriving on SpaceX's 12th NASA-contracted commercial resupply mission targeted to launch in August. \n The astronauts will assemble and deploy a microsatellite investigation seeking to validate the concept of using microsatellites in low-Earth orbit to support critical operations, such as providing lower-cost Earth imagery in time-sensitive situations such as tracking severe weather and detecting natural disasters.\n In addition, their work will also include an invesitgation into the study, developed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation of the pathology, of Parkinson's disease to aid in the development of therapies for patients on Earth as well as the use of the microgravity environment in stem cell research\n Whitson, Fischer and Yurchikhin are scheduled to remain aboard the station until September, while Bresnik, Ryazanskiy and Nespoli are scheduled to return in December. \n"

S'After a prolonged four-year fight with the State government to get justice, Leesha NS, who suffered serious injuries in the bomb blast near Malleswaram BJP office, has finally got a government job offer as the First Divisional Assistant in the Fire and emergency services department. This makes Leesha the first victim of terrorism to get a government job in Karnataka. An order to this effect was issued on Saturday by the Personnel and Administrative Reforms department and the same has been communicated to Leesha. Leesha is currently doing her MCA in RV College, reports Kannada Prabha.\nLeesha was 17-year-old when the bomb went off at the BJP office in Malleswaram in 2013. She had just come out for a lunch break from tuitions when the tragedy struck. Severely crippled, Leesha has to undergo multiple surgeries (at least nine) at different hospitals. She had petitioned in the court to consider as the victim of a terrorist act and sought compensation in the form of a government job. But with no response from the state government, Leesha had knocked the doors of the High court of Karnataka. Hearing her pleas, the High Court - on October 17 in 2017 - had directed the State government to provide her with a government job in three months. But even after eight months, the State government had not obeyed the court order forcing Leesha and her family to file a contempt of court against the State Home secretary. The State government which heard her pleas had warned the state government to give her a government job on June 6. However, the contempt plea will come before the court on August 1, reports Kannada Prabha.\n "I\'m really happy that the State government has finally rewarded my four-year fight. I\'m studying MCA at RV College and will decide whether to continue my studies along with work or not," reports Kannada Prabha quoting Leesha. Even after nine surgeries, Leesha still cannot walk without a support. Till now, Leesha\'s family has spent Rs 25 lakh on her treatment and the government has provided Rs 8 lakh towards her medical needs. Leesha who was in the hospital for over 200 days - during her surgeries - has cleared her CET exams and completed her BCA course. She is a MCA student at the RV College. Interestingly, her lawyer H Sunil Kumar has reportedly not taken his fee from Leesha\'s parents, reports Kannada Prabha. \n'

S'John McCain | File\nUS Senator John McCain has moved a legislative amendment in the Senate to impose gradual diplomatic, military, and economic costs on Pakistan if it continues to provide support to terrorist groups, including the Taliban and the Haqqani network.\nThe move, as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2018, is part of an effort by McCain to establish lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan, and to prevent this war-torn country from being a launch pad for terrorist attacks against the United states.\nMcCain is chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee and legislative moves by him always get through the Congress.\nThe Senate amendment 609 to NDAA- 2018 says that it is the sense of the US Congress to deny, disrupt, degrade, and destroy the ability of terrorist groups to conduct attacks against the US, its allies, and its core interests.\nThe amendment also allows it to prevent Taliban from using military force to overthrow the Afghan Government and reduce the Taliban\'s control of the Afghan population.\nAs part of this objective, McCain calls for strengthening the Afghan security forces, authorisation of US forces to target terrorists of the Haqqani network and the Taliban and others. He also calls for regional diplomatic initiatives including India under this move.\nThe legislative amendment calls for "imposing graduated diplomatic, military, and economic costs on Pakistan as long as it continues to provide support and sanctuary to terrorist and insurgent groups, includingthe Taliban and the Haqqani network.\n"It calls for simultaneously outlining the potential benefits of a long-term United States-Pakistan strategic partnership that could result from the cessation by Pakistan of support for all terrorist and insurgent groups and constructive role in bringing about a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan."\nMoved on the Senate floor on Thursday, the amendment also calls for intensifying America\'s regional diplomatic effortsworking through flexible frameworks for regional dialogue together with Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and other nations to promote political reconciliation in Afghanistan.\nThe move is also aimed towards advance regional cooperation on issues such as border security, intelligence sharing, counter-narcotics, transportation, and trade to reduce mistrust and build confidence among regional states.\nThe McCain amendment proposes strict conditioning of American economic, and governance assistance programs for Afghanistan upon measurable progress in achieving joint United States-Afghanistan benchmarks for implementing necessary institutional reforms, especially those related to anti- corruption, financial transparency, and the rule of law.\nCalling for increasing the number of US counter terrorism forces in Afghanistan; the amendment calls for providing the United States military with "status-based targeting authorities" against the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, al- Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and other terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies, and its core interests.\nIn his amendment, McCain calls for pursuing a joint agreement to secure a long-term, open-ended counter terrorism partnership between the US and Afghanistan, which he said would include an enduring United States counter terrorism presence in Afghanistan.\nThe US Senate is yet to vote on NDAA-2018.\nYesterday, in a statement, McCain rued on the delay in its passage.\n"It is unfortunate that one senator chose to block consideration of a bill our nation needs right now, the National Defense Authorization Act," he said.\n"For 55 years in a row, Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides our men and women in uniform with the resources, capabilities, and pay and benefits that they need to perform their missions on behalf of the American people and keep our country safe. This legislation is more vital than ever," McCain said.\n"Global terrorist networks, increasing great power competition with Russia and China, malign Iranian influence spreading across the Middle East, a North Korean dictator racing to acquire missiles that can hit the United States with nuclear weaponsthe threats to our national security have not been more complex or daunting than at any time in the past seven decades," he said.\n'

S' It reflects on the delicate diplomacy involved that the principal issue in the China-India standoff at Doklam is being mentioned only in muted tones. The problem is the undemarcated boundary between China and Bhutan. This demarcation would require Bhutan and China to settle the matter. The two doing a pirouette is not a good sight for India, which has a special bond with Bhutan sanctified in a treaty signed in 1949. Clause 2 of the treaty amended in 2007 (on which later) stated that Thimpu would be "guided by the advice of the government of India in its external relations". How can Thimpu settle its border, independent of the Sino-Indian boundary? \n Thimpu needed chaperoning when it took its first baby steps as a sovereign state. But once it came of age and made a formal debut at the UN\'s great ball (at India\'s initiative) in 1971, it began to feel the urge to dance with other partners, of course, without rupturing the special bond dictated by the 1949 treaty. India would remain more equal than others but others there shall surely be. India says "fine" but has palpitations when it fears that Bhutan may be groping for China\'s hand.\n At the coronation of the present king\'s father Jigme Singye Wangchuk in 1974, Foreign Minister Dawa Tsering said something that was not honeyed music to New Delhi.\n India\'s advice in the conduct of foreign affairs was welcome but "not binding" on Bhutan, he said. Indeed, among those invited to the coronation was China which turned up with a delegation, not a pleasing sight for the Indian contingent. A gentle, feather touch has marked Indo-Bhutanese diplomacy in both the capitals. Years 1978-79, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the External Affairs Minister, were marked by considerable warmth in relations.\n In August 1978, diplomatic missions in New Delhi received a circular note from the Bhutan mission that henceforth it should be addressed as the Royal Bhutan Embassy. The upgradation of the mission was not without considerable debate in South Block.\n Prime Minister Morarji Desai downwards there was an entire hierarchy, principally Foreign Secretary Jagat Mehta, endorsing a more relaxed policy towards Bhutan freeing the Himalayan kingdom from the more restrictive interpretations of the 1949 treaty. But there were hawks too.\n Desai\'s government fell in July 1979 making way for Charan Singh\'s five-month rule. More damage was done to New Delhi\'s relations with Thimpu during this brief period by the new, inexperienced External Affairs Minister Shyam Nandan Mishra than at any other period.\n He led the Indian delegation to the Havana summit of Non-Aligned Nations where the King of Bhutan took a position on a key issue which was independent to the brief Mishra was carrying.\n The cold war was at its peak. Indo-China was still at the centre of conflict. The two blocs were in fierce competition on who should occupy Kampuchea\'s seat at the summit. Pol Pot, backed by the US and China, or Heng Samrin, installed in Phnom Penh after Vietnam ousted Pol Pot. He set up sanctuaries on the border with Thailand.\n It seems almost comical to reflect that the world was, in the late 70s, riveted on Phnom Penh, Pol Pot and Heng Samrin. But contemplate the global picture, and the chips fall into place.\n In 1972, Nixon\'s visit to Beijing, creating a triangular strategic balance disadvantageous to Moscow. In 1978 Communists had come to power in Kabul, paving the way for the Soviet invasion. Next year, the Shah fell in Tehran. A pro-West Morarji Desai lost power in 1979. But in Pakistan, a pro-West Zia ul Haq held on to power.\n After what I saw at the battle of Lang Son, it was clear as daylight who won, but American media dragged its feet conceding victory to Vietnam in the Sino-Vietnam war of 1979. Vietnam\'s ouster of Pol Pot, his genocidal record notwithstanding, was, on the global chessboard, a reversal for both China and the US. Their romance was in its 9th year.\n It was in this tense global situation that Mishra, on his first mission as Foreign Minister, attempted to goad the King towards Heng Samrin (Soviet Union) while his own position was unclear. He must have made for a clumsy diplomat, because the King voted for Pol Pot much to the glee of the US, China and Pakistan.\n So cross was the King by the indecorous way he had been handled in Havana that, on his way back to Thimpu, he sought me out for what turned out to be a controversial interview. This was the only interview the King of Bhutan had ever granted to the media. I was then the Special Correspondent of the Indian Express.\n He clarified his vote in Havana. If Bhutan had not asked for Pol Pot\'s representative to be seated at Havana, it would have been tantamount to endorsing Vietnamese armed intervention in Kampuchea. He then made the allegation: "India took no position at all: Can you blame us if we took one and can our stand be described as being in opposition to India?" India\'s stand was neither here nor there: Let Pol Pot be seated but not participate -- a non-stand endorsed at an earlier NAM meet.\n On the relevance of the 1949 treaty, he said: "If you want my candid reply and not a diplomatic one -- the treaty can certainly be brought up to date." The two countries have not had serious differences in the interpretation of Article 2 of the treaty. "But why should we retain a treaty which can lend itself to loose interpretations?"\n The King was uncomfortable with the expression "close consultations" defining relations. He preferred "close understanding" -- consultations implied advice.\n The spirit of what the King said in September 1979 influenced the language of the treaty when it was revised in 2007. The new words were, "India and Bhutan will cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government should allow its territory for activities harmful to its national security."\n What will be the upshot of the Doklam standoff? Well, the King\'s explosive interview (on which more later) did have a ripple effect which, in slow measure, resulted in an amended treaty, freeing Bhutan somewhat.\n In the given situation, similar advantages will accrue to Bhutan post Doklam. These advantages will not displease China.\n After his return from Beijing, the National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, must brief the diplomatic corps in New Delhi which so far has heard only from the Chinese here and in important capitals. To my knowledge, only the Americans have been briefed by South Block.\n (Saeed Naqvi is a commentator on political and diplomatic affairs. The views expressed are personal.

S"Indians love 'masla doodh'! It is nothing but milk in which certain spices and nuts are mixed. Its flavor, aroma and taste are ethereal and more than that, it offers many health benefits.\nMasala milk is consumed almost on every festival in many parts of India. In fact, some drink it on a daily basis as it is very healthy.\nWhat are the actual ingredients of masala doodh? Well, crushed cashew nuts, crushed almonds, powdered cardamom, ginger powder, turmeric powder, saffron, crushed cloves and even pepper powder are mixed to boiling milk.\n Now, here is why it is healthy to drink masala doodh.\nAlmonds\nMasala milk contains almonds which are rich in Vitamin E, magnesium, protein, fiber and healthy fats. Almonds also reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure and even blood sugar levels.\nCashew Nuts\nCrushed cashews are another ingredient in this drink. Cashews contain selenium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, copper, vitamins B6, K and E. Of course, they also contain antioxidants.\nCardamom\nCardamom is a healthy spice which is used in many home remedies. It can cure constipation, lack of appetite, heartburn, bloating, acidity and even nausea.\nSaffron\nEven saffron is a therapeutic ingredient. It contains magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron, manganese, calcium, potassium and copper.

S' Hyper Scoop: Motor Trend gets the first extended drive in a Tesla Model 3 \nThe Tesla Model 3 is here, and it is the most important vehicle of the century. \nYes, the hyperbole is necessary. The original Tesla Model S was a proof of concept\xe2\x80\x94it was possible to make a long-range electric vehicle. The Model X showed that you could make an electric SUV. But neither was affordable to the masses. And although the Chevrolet Bolt has shown that 238 miles of electric range is possible for less than $40,000, GM\xe2\x80\x99s volume aspirations are modest.\nNot so for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wants to blow out the walls of his Fremont, California, factory to build a half-million Tesla Model 3s every year.\nTesla gave Motor Trend an opportunity for an extended test drive with the Tesla Model 3 engineer. Following is Testing Director Kim Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 review.\nThirty-six hours before Elon Musk hands the keys to the first 30 purchasers of the new Tesla Model 3 electric car, we are waiting at a gravel parking lot at the corner of Mullholland Highway and Old Topanga Road in Malibu. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d somebody asks. \xe2\x80\x9c8 a.m.\xe2\x80\x9d replies videographer Cory Lutz as he and Travis Labella ready an arsenal of GoPros. Everybody\xe2\x80\x94photographers Brian Vance and William Walker, me, the video guys\xe2\x80\x94are taking turns shooting glances up Old Topanga. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching for a red car.\n8:05: \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I hear somebody say. He is Franz von Holtzhausen, chief designer for Tesla. And the red car is not only his, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the most awaited and speculated-about automobiles in years\xe2\x80\x94the Tesla Model 3, a car I\xe2\x80\x99ve overheard relatives talking about who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many cylinders their Camry\xe2\x80\x99s engine has. The scene felt a little like Hollywood paparazzi staking out Justin Bieber again, but this time it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hijacking. In a somewhat intimidating coup, Franz is going to let me tear up and down nearby Stunt Road in it (and what better name for a test route, eh?).\nFranz emerges. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s a pedigreed car designer after deployments with VW, GM (Pontiac Solstice), and Mazda, the guy\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly Hollywood-cast for the Tesla taste-meister part, in black jeans, back T-shirt, and aviator sunglasses. And his car appears remarkably similar to the prototype. \xe2\x80\x9cWe softened the nose\xe2\x80\x99s frown a little, and these proximity sensors are new, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with a shrug. At the back, the parting lines do elegant double-duty as air-separation creases, the charging port\xe2\x80\x99s flap flips upward now, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no external badging at all, besides the Tesla logos. Franz climbs into the passenger seat as I slide in on his left. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive it like you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d he commands. \xe2\x80\x9cLike you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d I correct him with a crooked smile.\nAnyone familiar with the Model S will quickly feel oriented with the smaller Tesla Model 3. There\xe2\x80\x99s the shifter stalk on the right (reverse up, drive down, depress for park), but now with extra taps once under way, it doubles as the cruise-control lever. All of the car\xe2\x80\x99s infographics reside on a 15.4-inch, landscape-oriented multitouch screen that\xe2\x80\x99s perched on an austere, sweeping, almost Scandinavian-simple, dash. And being a Tesla, it\xe2\x80\x99s an hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre tray of software delectables. Interior air (from subtle vents) is aimed by moving spots around on the display, even dividing the airflow to send it past each ear. There\xe2\x80\x99s a wallet-able security card that plugs in, acting as a valet key. Other coolnesses? Franz\xe2\x80\x99 car is a loaded version\xe2\x80\x94a Premium (add $5,000), meaning better-grade materials, wood-veneered dash, 12-way front seats, 12-speaker sound, heated rear seats, side-by-side inductive phone chargers, and that panoramic glass ceiling that nevertheless protects like SPF 90 sunscreen. A detail that tickled me: One of the assignable functions of the twin thumb scrolls on the wheel spokes is tilting and telescoping the steering column. Cool. You adjust the wheel with your hands right where they should be. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take a lot more miles than this to decide if the single off-center screen completely substitutes for a conventionally located gauge cluster, but I\xe2\x80\x99m already adapting to it. At least I can always see the mph display near my right hand position (upper left corner of the screen) versus it being often half-hidden behind spokes.\nTesla worked hard to increase interior space, and subjectively it succeeded. For a compact car, the Model 3 feels incredibly light and airy. The dash is pulled ahead and pressed down, but cleverly, the touchscreen is apart from that, close to your right hand. (It was embedded into the Model S\xe2\x80\x99 dash, constraining them to be equidistant.) The Tesla Model 3 has a trunk opening instead of a Model S-like hatch to delete the hatch-required crossmember, which shaves rear headroom. The prototype\xe2\x80\x99s trunk opening was criticized as too small; now it\xe2\x80\x99s yawning. And at 15 cubic feet, with a very low lift-over and 60/40 folding rear seats, it looks hungry for a surfboard or a bike. (Franz assures me of this; he\xe2\x80\x99s a cyclist.) Up front, the frunk is precisely sized to hold a carry-on suitcase. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s too big here,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to check it.\xe2\x80\x9d I tap the stalk down into drive, and we arc out onto Mulholland.\nAnd then the foot goes down. How does it drive? The gush of torque clearly indicates DNA shared with the Model S. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s a new motor specific to the 3; Franz is coy about its horsepower, but Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s claim of 0-60 in 5.1 seconds seems right when paired with this car\xe2\x80\x99s $9,000 long-range battery. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a choice of two batteries. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s trying to change the vocabulary we\xe2\x80\x99re using to describe it, from \xe2\x80\x9ckilowatt-hours\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crange.\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says the standard one (while still doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds) will travel 220 miles, but his provides 310 miles of range. (Supercharging is available but at a fee that\xe2\x80\x99s attractive compared to filling with an equivalent amount of gasoline.)\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s blanching, though, is the car\xe2\x80\x99s ride and handling. If anybody was expecting a typical boring electric sedan here, nope. The ride is Alfa Giulia (maybe even Quadrifoglio)\xe2\x80\x93firm, and quickly, I\xe2\x80\x99m carving Stunt Road like a Sochi Olympics giant slalomer, micrometering my swipes at the apexes. I glance at Franz\xe2\x80\x94this OK? \xe2\x80\x9cGo for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he nods. The Model 3 is so unexpected scalpel-like, I\xe2\x80\x99m sputtering for adjectives. The steering ratio is quick, the effort is light (for me), but there\xe2\x80\x99s enough light tremble against your fingers to hear the cornering negotiations between Stunt Road and these 235/40R19 tires (Continental ProContact RX m+s\xe2\x80\x99s). And to mention body roll is to have already said too much about it. Sure, that battery is low, way down under the floor. But unlike the aluminum Model S, the Tesla Model 3 is composed of steel, too, and this car\xe2\x80\x99s glass ceiling can\xe2\x80\x99t be helping the center of gravity\xe2\x80\x99s height. Nearly-nil body roll? Magic, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. Magic. And this is the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive starting point. The already boggled mind boggles further at the mention of Dual Motor and Ludicrous.\nThe photographers stare, looking bummed they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten everything they wanted, but Franz has got to go. He\xe2\x80\x99s heading up to that same key handover in Fremont. Handshakes, then the red car silently whooshes out of sight around a corner, leaving a vacuum that\xe2\x80\x99s instantly filling with questions: Have I ever driven a more startling small sedan? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. At speed, it gains a laser-alertness I haven\xe2\x80\x99t encountered before. By happenstance, associate road test editor Erick Ayapana had penciled me into a 2.0-liter Alfa Romeo Giulia to get here, and it feels like a wet sponge by comparison. Technological fascination? Besides what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already described, the Tesla Model 3 is available with Enhanced Autopilot ($5,000) and for another $3,000 what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving Capability\xe2\x80\x9d in the future. A lot of money, sure\xe2\x80\x94but how many $35,000 cars offer that? Or for that matter, standard over-the-air updatability?\nBut of course, Franz\xe2\x80\x99s car isn\xe2\x80\x99t $35,000. A quick summing of its features puts it at about $59,500 before incentives\xe2\x80\x94including $1,500 for the larger 19-inch wheels (18 inches are standard), and a grand for the red multicoat paint. (You can have any no-extra-cost color as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s black. Seriously.) And it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a while before $35,000 versions are built, but reservation holders can place an order for an upgraded Model 3.\nAs we pack up, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking. Recently I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending some time in Motor Trend\xe2\x80\x99s long-term Chevrolet Bolt EV and with every mile edging closer to calling it The Automobile 2.0. With its affordability, stress-free range, and delightful driving qualities, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that maybe this is where the second era of the car commences. Pause that thought. With the Tesla Model 3\xe2\x80\x99s performance, slinky style, fascinating creativity, and, critically, its Supercharger safety net, I think this is truly where it begins.

S"Image Credit: Tesla\nTesla made a big deal about its Model 3's base price of $35,000 and how that makes it attractive to a whole new range of buyers who couldn't afford its more expensive Model S or Model X. While it's certainly true that a Model 3 will be cheapest way to get into a brand-new Tesla, let's be clear that there will be practically zero Model 3s at its base starting price of $35,000. Here's why.\n Choosing any color other than black raises the Model 3's price by a grand. If you want an upgraded interior package, that'll be $5,000. To be fair, a package that includes upgraded 12-way power heated seats, open-pore wood trim, a higher-end audio system, and a center console with docking for two smartphones is very attractive at that $5K price point. It's such a good deal, in fact, that we'd be surprised if most Model 3s weren't so equipped, which raises the non-black EV to $41,000.\n Another of Tesla's well-publicized features is Autopilot. All Model 3s get some assisted driving features, such as emergency braking and collision avoidance. But if you want a Model 3 that will stay in its own lane at the speed of traffic, exit freeways autonomously, and self-park itself, that'll be another $5,000. Granted, not everyone is going to want those features, but if they do, that'll raise the cost of our hypothetical Model 3 to $46,000.\n At some point in the future, Tesla promises to enable full self-driving capability to the Model 3. There's currently no timetable for activation of this technology, and Tesla says it may vary by location due to the need for regulatory approval. Still, if you want to future-proof a Model 3 with this potential capability, it will cost another $3,000 over the $5,000 cost of the Autopilot kit.\n Bear in mind that we're talking about the standard Model 3 that boasts a range of 220 miles and does 0-60 in 5.6 seconds. The long-range Model 3 with a range of 310 miles and a 0-60 time of 5.1 seconds (it also charges faster and can go 10 mph faster flat-out) starts at $44,000. It's these long-range Model 3s that are currently being built. The standard model with its $35,000 sticker has a planned production start date of November, 2017.\n All the same options we discussed \xe2\x80\x93 upgraded interior and autonomous hardware \xe2\x80\x93 are available on the long-range Model 3 just as they are on the standard version. Piling all those same options on the long-range Model 3 brings us to $58,000. We're in no position to opine on the value proposition of any Model 3 considering that we've yet to see one in person for a detailed analysis, let alone drive one. Also, every single car sold in America has an advertised base price that quickly rises with options. But the fact remains that very few people will actually buy a $35,000 Tesla Model 3.\n"

S'The players and Cricket Australia have failed to reach agreement on a new pay deal, leaving 230 cricketers unemployed since the end of June. \nHighlights\n 1 Players and the CA have failed to reach agreement on a new pay deal  \n 2 230 cricketers are unemployed since the end of June  \n 3 The Test squad is due to go into camp on August 11 \nFormer captain Michael Clarke said a bitter pay dispute between players and Cricket Australia (CA) was "horrible" for the game and their relationship was likely to be in tatters even after a resolution. After months of negotiations, the players and CA have failed to reach agreement on a new pay deal, leaving 230 cricketers unemployed since the end of June when their contracts expired. CA chief executive James Sutherland said last week that unless intensive negotiations over a revenue-sharing deal produced a compromise by early this week, his organisation would seek the intervention of an industrial umpire to resolve the impasse.\nClarke feared things would not be the same between the governing body and the players if and when the disagreement was finally resolved.\n"I think it\'s been horrible for the game, to be honest," Clarke said told commercial broadcaster Channel Nine.\n"There is no doubt what has happened will affect the relationship even more than it already was affected between players and Cricket Australia. The problem we have got now is that it is not just the\nAustralian players that are affected", he added, saying the fans and the public were also involved in "the number one story in Australian sport".\nNegotiations between the two warring parties continued over the weekend, with the key issue a new revenue model.\nThe players were paid from gross revenue for the past two decades, but CA now wants payments to come from a set pool, with players to share only in surplus revenue.\nClarke said he could understand the arguments of both parties but added: "Whatever has been going on, it should have been done in private."\nThe Test squad is due to go into camp on August 11 ahead of a Test tour of Bangladesh, which is in danger of being scrapped following the boycott of Australia A\'s tour to South Africa earlier this month.\nThe long-running dispute also threatens Australia\'s one-day tour to India in September and October ahead of the showpiece home Ashes series, beginning in November.\n'

S'An ailing elephant fell into mud in a paddy field near Deulijhar village in Angul district on Saturday.\n BHUBANESWAR/ROURKELA: A female elephant died after a passenger train hit it near Beheramunda in Sundargarh district late on Friday. The animal died on the spot. In another incident, an ailing elephant fell into mud in a paddy field near Deulijhar village in Angul district on Saturday. \n Sources said 19 elephants reportedly entered Sundargarh forest division on Friday evening. A team of forest officials chased the elephant to keep them away from Lamlibahal, but the herd entered the village and damaged a couple of houses. Later the elephant herd got divided and nine of them moved towards the railway track. Eight of them crossed the track, whereas a six-year-old female elephant got hit by the Yesvantpur-Tata Express. \n  "Keeping the elephant movement in mind, we had requested the railway officials to control the speed of the train. The trains also slowed down on the stretch but still the accident took place," said divisional forest officer (Sundargarh) Arun Mishra. The railway officials and forest department staff reached the spot and started investigation. A team of veterinary officials conducted postmortem of the elephant that was later buried near the railway track. \n The second incident took place near Deulijhar village under Angul\'s Athmalik forest range. "A sick female elephant was trapped in the mud of a paddy field. As the elephant was unwell, she fell down while crossing the paddy field. Though she tried to get up and walk, it failed," said a forest official. \n DFO Athmalik K S Pradeep said he got information about the elephant at around 5 am. "We rushed to the site with veterinarians. With the help of the villagers, we rescued the animal from the mud and took it to a dry place near the paddy field. Two veterinarians have started treating the animal," he added. \n  Pradeep said the jumbo has general weakness. District veterinary officer of Angul and his colleague attended the 20-year-old female elephant. "Condition of the animal is improving. We will monitor it for 48 hours. If it gets fit, we will let her enter into the forest," said the DFO. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S"Top News headlines\n Bijnor: The Uttar Pradesh government has announced that scholarships for minority students will be available only for those who have secured more than 50% marks. There was no percentage limit for scholarships for students of the minority community earlier, with even those who did not pass annual exams eligible. However, while the scheme was previously only available for economically weaker minority students, now it will be open for all, according to officials. \n Detection of suspicious transactions up; Rs 562 crore black money unearthed \n30 Jul 2017, 20:03\n Gujarat CM slams Ahmed Patel's 'greed' to win Rajya Sabha seat; Congress leader hits back \n30 Jul 2017, 19:08\n File income tax returns by July 31, no plans to extend deadline: I-T dept \n30 Jul 2017, 18:26\n Deal for supply of 48 Mi-17 choppers to India likely by year end: Russia \n30 Jul 2017, 11:47\n Government won't blink if larger national interests are involved: Jaitley at GST Conclave \n30 Jul 2017, 21:12\n NIA searches office, home of lawyer linked to Geelani \n30 Jul 2017, 18:38\n Missile test 'warning' against US sanctions push: North Korea \n30 Jul 2017, 17:55\n Kalam's kin seek to defuse row over Gita sculpture \n30 Jul 2017, 16:34\n Don't feel burdened by World Cup defeat: Modi to Indian women's cricket team \n30 Jul 2017, 15:54\n Bengal flood situation improves; 7 dead in Odisha \n30 Jul 2017, 20:56\n Detection of suspicious transactions up; Rs 562 crore black money unearthed \n30 Jul 2017, 20:03\n Gujarat CM slams Ahmed Patel's 'greed' to win Rajya Sabha seat; Congress leader hits back \n30 Jul 2017, 19:08\n File income tax returns by July 31, no plans to extend deadline: I-T dept \n30 Jul 2017, 18:26\n Deal for supply of 48 Mi-17 choppers to India likely by year end: Russia \n30 Jul 2017, 11:47\n Government won't blink if larger national interests are involved: Jaitley at GST Conclave \n30 Jul 2017, 21:12\n NIA searches office, home of lawyer linked to Geelani \n30 Jul 2017, 18:38\n Missile test 'warning' against US sanctions push: North Korea \n30 Jul 2017, 17:55\n Kalam's kin seek to defuse row over Gita sculpture \n30 Jul 2017, 16:34\n Don't feel burdened by World Cup defeat: Modi to Indian women's cricket team \n30 Jul 2017, 15:54\n Bengal flood situation improves; 7 dead in Odisha \n30 Jul 2017, 20:56\n Detection of suspicious transactions up; Rs 562 crore black money unearthed \n30 Jul 2017, 20:03\n Gujarat CM slams Ahmed Patel's 'greed' to win Rajya Sabha seat; Congress leader hits back \n30 Jul 2017, 19:08\n File income tax returns by July 31, no plans to extend deadline: I-T dept \n30 Jul 2017, 18:26\n Deal for supply of 48 Mi-17 choppers to India likely by year end: Russia \n30 Jul 2017, 11:47\n Government won't blink if larger national interests are involved: Jaitley at GST Conclave \n30 Jul 2017, 21:12\n NIA searches office, home of lawyer linked to Geelani \n30 Jul 2017, 18:38\n Missile test 'warning' against US sanctions push: North Korea \n30 Jul 2017, 17:55\n Kalam's kin seek to defuse row over Gita sculpture \n30 Jul 2017, 16:34\n Don't feel burdened by World Cup defeat: Modi to Indian women's cricket team \n30 Jul 2017, 15:54\n Bengal flood situation improves; 7 dead in Odisha \n30 Jul 2017, 20:56\n Detection of suspicious transactions up; Rs 562 crore black money unearthed \n30 Jul 2017, 20:03\n Gujarat CM slams Ahmed Patel's 'greed' to win Rajya Sabha seat; Congress leader hits back \n30 Jul 2017, 19:08\n File income tax returns by July 31, no plans to extend deadline: I-T dept \n30 Jul 2017, 18:26\n Deal for supply of 48 Mi-17 choppers to India likely by year end: Russia \n30 Jul 2017, 11:47\n Government won't blink if larger national interests are involved: Jaitley at GST Conclave \n30 Jul 2017, 21:12\n NIA searches office, home of lawyer linked to Geelani \n30 Jul 2017, 18:38\n Missile test 'warning' against US sanctions push: North Korea \n30 Jul 2017, 17:55\n Kalam's kin seek to defuse row over Gita sculpture \n30 Jul 2017, 16:34\n Don't feel burdened by World Cup defeat: Modi to Indian women's cricket team \n30 Jul 2017, 15:54\n Bengal flood situation improves; 7 dead in Odisha \n30 Jul 2017, 20:56\n Detection of suspicious transactions up; Rs 562 crore black money unearthed \n30 Jul 2017, 20:03\n Gujarat CM slams Ahmed Patel's 'greed' to win Rajya Sabha seat; Congress leader hits back \n30 Jul 2017, 19:08\n File income tax returns by July 31, no plans to extend deadline: I-T dept \n30 Jul 2017, 18:26\n Deal for supply of 48 Mi-17 choppers to India likely by year end: Russia \n30 Jul 2017, 11:47\n Government won't blink if larger national interests are involved: Jaitley at GST Conclave \n30 Jul 2017, 21:12\n NIA searches office, home of lawyer linked to Geelani \n30 Jul 2017, 18:38\n Missile test 'warning' against US sanctions push: North Korea \n30 Jul 2017, 17:55\n Kalam's kin seek to defuse row over Gita sculpture \n30 Jul 2017, 16:34\n Don't feel burdened by World Cup defeat: Modi to Indian women's cricket team \n30 Jul 2017, 15:54\n Bengal flood situation improves; 7 dead in Odisha \n30 Jul 2017, 20:56\n UP has two types of scholarship schemes, either sponsored by the state government or by the Centre. Earlier, minority students from class 1 to 10, whose parents had an annual income below Rs 1 lakh, were eligible for the scholarships. For students in higher classes, up to graduate level, eligible minority candidates had to have parents with annual income below Rs 2 lakh.\n However, from this academic session onwards, all minority students will be eligible for the scholarship, provided they score more than 50%. Nearly 10 lakh minority students at different levels of study had applied for the scheme in UP in 2016.\n District minority welfare officer Praveen Mishra said, \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the guidelines issued by the government, students getting more than 50% marks in their previous class will be eligible. Those who get from 50% to 70% marks will be eligible for state-sponsored scholarships, while students scoring more than 70% will get central scholarships.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Mishra added, \xe2\x80\x9cStudents of class 1 to 5 get Rs 1,000 each every year while students of class 6 to 8 get Rs 5,000 as scholarship and fees reimbursement. Students of class 9 to 12 get Rs 9,000 and students pursuing graduation and technical courses get up to 50,000 every year. This year highest limit of fees reimbursement has been reduced from Rs 80,000 to Rs 50,000 for graduate and technical courses. The government has started the selection process by which only eligible students will get the scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d\n According to the minority welfare officer, the decision by the UP government was based on changes made by the Centre. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery year, all students applying for the scholarship do not get it. Sometimes a student who gets low marks may get scholarship, while a better student may not, because not every applicant can be given scholarship. Now the government wants only good students to get the scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Mohammad Saleem, a teacher of Mandawali Madrassa, told TOI, \xe2\x80\x9cThe government should give the benefit of the scholarship to all minority students so that they can study and join the mainstream. Most minority students are poor in any case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n"

S'I had 22 jobs before I started my own business at the age of 23, and I didn\'t want one more boss telling me what to do. - Shark Tank investor Barbara Corcoran\nA lot of us struggle with motivation -- especially after a personal or business failure. Not to be cold, but at some point we all have those moments when either an internal or external forces zaps our motivation. The difference with successful people is that no matter what\'s going on within them or around them outside, they can still find motivation.\nWant to know where extremely successful individuals find this motivation? Here are eight places where successful people find their motivation.\nThey start with "why."\nHighly motivated, and successful, individuals always start with their why. After all, it\'s the purpose, cause, or belief that inspires them to do what they\'re doing. For instance, entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor Barbara Corcoran had a pretty simple \'why.\' She never wanted to take orders from another boss again.\n"I had 22 jobs before I started my own business at the age of 23, and I didn\'t want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn\'t want a boss."\nIf you want to be more successful, like Corcoran, find your why by jotting down a \'Why Statement\' which is simply one sentence that clearly expresses your unique contribution and impact.\nKnow their limiting step.\n"What\'s your limiting step?" asks motivational public speaker and self-development author Brian Tracy. "What\'s the one skill area that\'s holding you back? What\'s the quality? What\'s the action? Ask other people. Find out what you need to become good at."\nTracey suggests that you, "Find out what\'s keeping you stuck" and identifying the "critical limiting step that\'s determining your success today."\nEmbracing the \'Hacker Way.\'\nDespite the negative associations, hacking isn\'t just a bunch of nefarious individuals doing things like stealing personal information for their own good. There\'s actually plenty of ethical hackers who want to make the world just a little bit better, such as Mark Zuckerberg.\n"The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it -- often in the face of people who say it\'s impossible or are content with the status quo."\nZuckerberg adds, "Hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once." In fact, to support this mentality, Facebook has the words "Done is better than perfect" painted on its walls.\nStaying focused on the big picture.\nAs Oprah Winfrey once said, "Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe."\nRemember, there will be days when you\'re frustrated, sick, or bored by repetitive tasks. It\'s on those days that successful individuals stay focused on the big picture - instead of throwing in the proverbial white towel.\nBut, how exactly do they accomplish big-picture thinking on a regular basis? They use strategies like:\nBlocking off "thinking time" when you\'re the most creative.\nHave a conversation with someone, or write down your thoughts, to keep you on-track and block your brain from other thoughts.\nPick specific goals to tackle.\nIdentify the actionable first steps that you need to take.\nStart generating ideas - James Altucher has an excellent guide on how you can become an idea machine.\nSurround themselves with catalysts.\nThere are people, and other internal/external factors, that can either excite or drain you completely. For instance, do you think you\'ll be motivated by someone who is constantly pessimistic or criticizes every move you make? Or, do you think you\'ll be motivated by someone who is optimistic and supportive?\nSuccessful people seek out and surround themselves with the people who energize them and help them find their mojo. As Richard Branson explains:\n "My professional inspiration has no separation from my personal inspiration: it is people who will stop at nothing to make a positive difference to other people\'s lives. I am fortunate to come across quite a few of these game-changing people, and the desire to help (and keep up with them!) is what drives me." \nMore importantly, you also need to make sure that you are your own catalyst. Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk so that when you stumble you don\'t beat yourself up. Instead, you\'ll look for ways to improve the next time around.\nCatalysts can also be inspirational books, quotes, documentaries, or any other outside force that can get you going every morning.\nPassion.\n"If you love what you do and are willing to do what it takes, it\'s within your reach. Don\'t worry that you can\'t seem to come up with pure billion dollar winners at first. Just do projects for yourself for fun. You\'ll get better and better," Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak wrote in his autobiography iWoz.\nDon\'t know your passion? Do some research, talk to your nearest and dearest, brainstorm your thoughts, and make connections. And, don\'t be afraid to try something new. Getting out of your comfort zone introduces you to new people, experiences, and customs that you may become passionate about.\nA sense of urgency.\nLet\'s be honest, if you don\'t move fast then you\'re going to get run over. That\'s why highly motivated and successful people live with a sense of urgency. Thankfully, that\'s something anyone can achieve if they follow these four steps:\nEstablish an inspiring vision for their future by answering questions like "What is my life\'s vision?" and "What goals do I want to achieve?" However, they also don\'t sugarcoat the fact that there will realistic obstacles and setbacks along the way.\nBreak down your goals into parts into smaller projects and set deadlines. Make sure that you identify the knowledge, tools, skills, or support you\'ll need in order to get the job done.\nIdentify the reasons or benefits to move forward by knowing why specific tasks are important, how it makes you feel, and what you\'ll lose out-on if you don\'t complete a goal.\nCreate penalties and rewards.\nAnd, always remember, "Without a sense of urgency, desire loses its value." - Jim Rohn\nThey create and stick to healthy and effective habits.\nYou\'ve probably heard this a million times; you need to take care of yourself. Exercise, for starters, keeps you physically, mentally, and emotionally sharp since it increases levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine which can help reduce stress and improve your mood.\nMeditation also alleviates stress and improves your mood, but it also clears your mind so that you can focus. And, of course eating a well-balanced diet and getting quality sleep each night also improves your health.\nHowever, successful people also create effective habits like being optimistic, learning how to say \'no,\' maintained to-do-lists, understanding how to prioritize, and practicing and improving their skills.\nWhere do you find motivation?\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

S'The popularity of virgin hair can be attributed to the fact that it is 100% natural and of high quality. The hair can be dyed multiple times without the hair losing its shine. There are many types of virgin hair available in the market. Some of the popular ones are Indian, Burmese, Brazilian, Malaysian, etc. Each hair type has its plus points and quality of the hair is shaped by several external factors. This ensures that no two hair types are the same. These days more and more people are opting for virgin hair wigs, as it is perceived as a safe option.\nTop 5 Reasons to Choose Virgin Hair\nQuality: Virgin hair is authentic, untouched and natural hair that comes from a single donor. It is 100% authentic hair, which only adds to its value. It does not require a lot of brushing and continues to maintain its original flow. It has not been straightened out artificially, unlike other types available in the market. It has not been washed or dipped in harmful chemicals in order to give it an artificial shine. Their cheap counterparts do not hold a candle to the quality assurance provided by virgin hair. We recommend you go for Brazilian virgin hair body wave or a body wave frontal for a better overall look.\n Color: Virgin hair is ideal for coloring. This is because it has not been colored earlier. The coloring on such hair looks beautiful as it is being colored for the very first time. It is only after a few coloring that the hair quality starts to deteriorate. The user can be assured during the first few months, as the hair can be colored multiple times without the hair losing its quality/shine. This allows for creativity when it comes to hair styling and fashion. Different combinations can be tried out for various occasions. The user can choose the type of hair shade to go with their outfit and achieve the desired look. Virgin hair wigs are easily available in the market.\n Maintenance: Since this hair is all natural and untouched, it is much easier to manage. The hair will have a much longer lifespan and the user will not have to spend much time or money on maintaining the hair. All they would have to do is shampoo their hair regularly. This would also mean fewer trips to the parlor. This would ensure that the user saves time and can concentrate on other important things. Also, the user would get the opportunity to flaunt their beautiful hair on every occasion. A good option would be a Brazilian frontal wig along with hair weave bundles.\n Good Investment: If you are looking for wigs, then you have two options. The first is artificially manufactured hair that has been washed and manipulated to achieve the desired result. You can spend a lot of time and still not be sure of the hair\xe2\x80\x99s shelf life. The other option is virgin hair, where the quality and longevity of the hair is assured to be top-grade. Therefore, it is a good investment as you only have to invest once and reap the benefits over a significant period of time. Brazilian human hair extensions are also quite popular.\nVariety: There are several types of Virgin hair available in the market. Some of the popular ones are Brazilian, Peruvian, Indian, Malaysian, Burmese, Mongolian, Cambodian, Eurasian, European, Filipino and Russian virgin hair. Each type of virgin hair has its distinct features, flow, and strengths and weaknesses. This is heavily influenced by the climate conditions, nutrition, and other factors. This gives the customer a lot of variety for choosing the right hair according to their requirements.\nAbout nanavirginhair.com\nStart from 2000 years collection virgin Hair. Nana Hair has been striving to provide premium virgin hair and responsible service. Every piece of hair is unique and precious. It passes the original beauty on to the new successor.

S'You no longer need to be a billion dollar company to pursue new discoveries\nCREDIT: Getty Images\nDesigning an airplane has long been an exercise in tradeoffs. A larger airplane with more powerful engines can hold more people and go farther, but is costlier to run. A smaller one is more cost efficient, but lacks capacity. For decades, these have been nearly inviolable constraints that manufacturers just had to live with.\nBoeing\'s new 787 Dreamliner is different. It didn\'t just redesign the airplane, it redesigned the materials that go in it. Because of its use of composite materials that are lighter and stronger than traditional metals, the company was able to build an aircraft that is 20% more efficient, but sacrifices nothing in terms of capacity or performance.\nTypically, this has been a game that only a multibillion dollar corporation can play. The cost of developing and testing new materials costs millions of dollars a year, with no guarantee of any return on investment. Yet today, that\'s beginning to change. Big data and machine learning are revolutionizing the science of making things and make it available to the masses.\nWhen Cancer Becomes Data\nThe seeds of the coming revolution, ironically, lie not in the factory floor, but in a cancer lab. Typically, cancer research has been approached according to the traditional scientific method. A scientist would come up with a theory about how a particular mutation causes a tumor, apply for a grant, perform a study and then publish results. But in 2005, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), saw an opportunity to go in another direction.\n"We said, \'Let\'s gather data along with some basic analysis, publish it and allow the scientific community to study it,\'" Jean Claude Zenklusen a biologist at NCI told me. "We did this because we believed by releasing the data in this way, we could tap into the collective expertise of thousands of researchers across a number of fields and accelerate innovation."\nThis approach formed the basis for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a joint project between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute, which began in 2006. It has since sequenced the tumors of over 10,000 patients encompassing 33 types of cancer. "Cancer data has now become open data," Zenklusen told me proudly.\nThe success of the program turned traditional science on its head. It showed that you no longer need to spend years testing a hypothesis to do science effectively. There is already an abundance of scientific data gathered from endless experiments and most of it is discarded. New data techniques, however, make it possible to make use of it.\nA Materials Genome\nWhen you think about it, a manufacturing process is much like a genome. DNA codes for proteins that determine how stuff in biological organisms gets built. If you have one set of proteins, you might have brown eyes. If you have another, you might have blue. The same goes for our blood type, our cellular process and virtually every aspect about us.\nThe materials that go into manufactured products work in a similar way. The initial components, like metals, chemicals or organic materials go through a particular process that gives the material certain properties, like density, tensile strength, electrical conductivity and many other things. These properties then determine a product\'s performance.\nHistorically, developing new materials has been a slow and expensive process because while there are countless materials and ways to process them, identifying one that will give you the properties you want is like looking for a very small needle in an almost infinitely large haystack. That\'s why only massive companies like Boeing can afford to do continuous materials research.\nHowever, now there is an effort to change that. Much like The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) collects data on thousands of materials. So research done to test materials for one purpose, can be used to provide insights on how to use that information for something else altogether.\nFor example, scientists at the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) at Argonne National Laboratory are currently testing thousands of compounds in their quest to make next generation batteries. Very few will be of use to them, but by including their work in the MGI data set, others can make use of it.\nBig Data And The Democratization of Exploratory Research\nThe idea of collecting information in a central repository is nothing new, but what makes programs like The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Materials Genome Initiative profoundly different is that their data is machine readable. So instead of a human scientist spending years poring through hundreds of tables and charts, a computer can analyze millions in a small fraction of that time.\nCitrine Informatics, a company founded by three materials scientists, is taking the next logical step by applying advanced machine learning algorithms to materials data. "We want to do for manufacturing and materials what Microsoft did for offices, enable companies of all sizes to do high quality work, much faster and more productively than they ever thought they could before," Greg Mulholland, the firm\'s CEO told me.\nA similar revolution is underway in genomics. As researchers learn more about the genetic code and put that data online, a new technique, called CRISPR, is enabling even amateur scientists to edit genes at will. The procedure, discovered in 2012, has already resulted in a number of breakthroughs.\nWhat\'s essential to understand about these new developments is that you don\'t need a multimillion dollar lab to make use of them. Today, just about anybody can access this knowledge and, with machine learning algorithms becoming increasingly ubiquitous, will be able to create enormous value with it.\nThe Mindset Shift\nMuch like the Internet democratized knowledge -- a teenager with a smartphone today has more access to information than a specialist at a large institution a generation ago -- big data and machine learning will bring scientific understanding to the masses. In the years to come, that will revolutionize how we make things, especially for small and medium sized companies.\nUp till now, to come up with a breakthrough you needed use the scientific method of hypothesis, experimentation and verification, which although effective, is incredibly tedious and costly. Now, however, with experimental results increasingly available to anyone with an Internet connection, that\'s beginning to change.\nToday, there are a number of ways for even small companies to access world class research, from government programs to industry consortiums to collaborations with local universities and, much like Boeing, they can use that knowledge to create revolutionary products. In fact, it is likely that anybody who doesn\'t will find it difficult to compete in the future.\nHowever, every shift in capabilities requires a shift in mindset. We can no longer think about the process of discovery in the traditional way in which we meticulously plod along until we hit on something big. Rather, we need to think about exploration itself as a competitive advantage. Not all who wander are lost. The trick is to learn to wander with purpose.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

S' NEW DELHI: To counter Reliance Jio, Vodafone is targeting students with a new scheme that will offer unlimited calls with 1 gigabyte of 4G/3G data every day for 84 days, according to a company official. \n Reliance Jio is offering similar benefits for Rs 399 along with free roaming and unlimited SMS. \n Vodafone has announced \'Vodafone Campus Survival Kit\' for students in Delhi-NCR.

S' Diabetic Neuropathy is the damage caused to the nerve due to diabetes which often leads to pain and numbness in feet or lower legs. The pain can be experienced in other parts of the body such as hips, wrist and back depending upon the effect of neuropathy. There are different types of neuropathy such as focal neuropathy, proximal neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. An estimated 50% of diabetic population suffers from diabetic neuropathy across the globe. Further, as per CDC estimates, 6-7 people per 1000 diabetic population suffer from diabetic neuropathy in the U.S. Rise in aging population coupled with rise in prevalence of diabetes, the patient pool for diabetic neuropathy will increase significantly, in turn fueling growth of the diabetic neuropathy market.\nRequest a sample copy of this report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/213 \nNew drugs to treat neuropathy pain will alter the current market dynamics\nThe diabetic neuropathy market has been under continuous evolution from the past 5 years. There are generic drugs and specialty drugs including antidepressants and antispasmodics, as well to treat pain associated with the disorder. However, in 2011, there were an estimated 79 novel drugs in the clinical trial phase with Horizant (Gabapentin Enacarbil extended release) being one of the most effective drug. The pharmaceutical companies will continue the required geographic expansion and release novel drugs across major countries in different regions. Further, the growing awareness about diabetic neuropathy, increased healthcare spending and increase in pharmaceutical R&D spending will be important factors for growth in the diabetic neuropathy market.\nAsia Pacific region will be the next frontier of growth in the global diabetic neuropathy market\nNorth America is the largest market for diabetic neuropathy, with an estimated 35 million affected by the disease in U.S and Canada. The pharmaceutical companies continue to introduce novel drugs in the region in order to offset the generic drug erosion. Diabetic neuropathy treatment has gained immense traction especially in U.S. due to large patient pool, high incidence of diabetes and growing geriatric population. However, the strict regulatory scenario for drug approval in U.S. and Canada has been a challenge for the diabetic neuropathy market. Other factors such as significant rate of failure during clinical trials and long drug approval time continue to restrain the growth in industry.\nAsia Pacific region is fastest growing region with countries such as India and China showing lucrative growth. India has one of the highest rates of diabetes type 2 in the world and according to an independent research, by year 2030, an estimated 80 million people will be affected with diabetes type 2 in India. Additionally, the study concluded that the prevalence rate for diabetic neuropathy was 29% in the entire patient population. China has edged India and has a diabetes patient population of 110 million which is projected to reach 150 million by 2040, as per data published by WHO. Major pharmaceutical companies are now venturing into Asia pacific region and the market is poised to witness substantial growth in the region due to large patient population, less stringent regulatory scenario, increasing R&D investment, growth in clinical trials conducted and government funding for the disease treatment.\nBrowse more detail information about Diabetic Neuropathy Market at: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/diabetic-neuropathy-market-213 \nThe introduction of new players will change the existing market dynamics as they continue to compete with existing key players\nThe key players in the diabetic neuropathy market are Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Due to the high cost associated with the development of novel drugs and long regulatory approval time, the major players in the diabetic neuropathy industry acquire small players possessing unique drugs. The market is consolidated in nature with major pharmaceutical players accounting for major market share. As majority of current breed of drugs undergo patent expiration, the generic drugs will enter the market and the key competitors would have to introduce innovative products into the market to stay competitive.\nAbout Coherent Market Insights:\nCoherent Market Insights is a prominent market research and consulting firm offering action-ready syndicated research reports, custom market analysis, consulting services, and competitive analysis through various recommendations related to emerging market trends, technologies, and potential absolute dollar opportunity. \nAbout the Author\nContact Us:\nRaj Shah\nCoherent Market Insights\n1001 4th Ave,\n#3200\nSeattle, WA 98154\nTel: +1-206-701-6702\nEmail: sales@coherentmarketinsights.com\nVisit Coherent Market Insights Blog @ https://blog.coherentmarketinsights.com/\nConnect with us on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/company/coherent-market-insights\n(Average: Not rated)\n'

S"With over 600 million active users, Instagram is now more than a place to post selfies and brunch. So how do successful brands incorporate Instagram into their marketing strategies?\nIn our fast-paced digital world, social networking is taking over as the primary way most people receive information. Instagram, one of the fastest-growing social networking platforms, is used daily by more than half of its 600 million active users. And it's good for more than just posting selfies, brunches, and fur babies, as cute as they may be.\nAt a time when visual content is critical for any brand to execute on a successful marketing strategy, Instagram presents a unique opportunity to position your brand creatively and showcase its personality. Plus, it's a place where your consumers can see your curated content on the daily without feeling overwhelmed by emails and notifications. Half of the platform's users check their feed multiple times a day.\nCompanies have not only grown but have been born on social platforms like Instagram. So what makes them so insta-good?\nBasics and Beyond\nWe all know by now the basics for social content best practices. Create unique posts and engage users in a personal way that affects people on an emotional level. Know why you're posting what you're posting. And don't forget to participate in the conversation! It's invaluable to show your followers that you care.\nYou might be thinking, OK. So I'm doing all of that. What's next?\nShow your personality. Define your point of view. Are you funny? Inspirational? Heartfelt? Sarcastic? What are you trying to say and to whom are you trying to say it?\nEngage your users. We know that Instagram is a bit self-involved, so use that to your advantage! Users love to see themselves regrammed by brands that they love. Reusing content is also free to produce! Run contests and giveaways to source user generated content (UGC) and build your audience.\nShow your fans who you are behind the scenes. Let your hair down and shake it out!\nUse hashtags both to increase impressions and to generate UGC. Want inspiration in that vein? Search #Starbucks and you'll see what I mean.\nPromote your ads. Yes, you need to put money where your posts are if you want to see results.\nKnow your goals, engagement versus conversion, and how to optimize posts for each. How do you know? A/B testing is the only way to really know for sure, since the mix up is different for every brand.\nThe Big Players in the Space\n1. Nike (73.3 million followers) is one of a handful of fitness brands that have really blown up on Instagram. Once the reigning champion of successful brands on this social network, it has recently slipped to second place, just behind Nat Geo.\nSetting the bar for social brand identity, Nike posts images that embrace lifestyle, rather than focusing solely on product. Inspirational, motivational, and inclusive, Nike uses creative copy that speaks both to professional athletes and exercise newbs alike, in all areas of life, not just at the gym.\n2. Cosmetics retail giant Sephora (12 million followers) is super successful at engaging followers with visually stunning content that clearly reflects the brand's identity. Playful captions pair with colorful images and fun patterns. Sephora is not afraid of posting video content with the same playful vibe.\nMade in Sephora (438,000 followers), a secondary account for the brand, uses its handle to source user generated content (UGC) and hold contests that expand its ever-growing fan base and increase their daily engagement.\n3. Vans (8.2 million followers) is a great example of a brand that uses its social content to engage users outside of its brick-and-mortar stores. It's very successful at creating a brand identity around lifestyle, rather than product, staying true to the company's roots and values established more than 50 years ago.\nVans uses music, art, and culture in its visual content, and takes advantage of user generated content that does the same. Vans hosts offline events (such as its famous Warped Tour) and meets customers and prospective customers where they live, work, and play.\n4. Finfolk Productions (173,000 followers) uses Instagram to build a community of mermaid followers (called the pod squad--can it get any cuter?). Finfolk is great at reposting photos of its customers in its product, getting buy-in from Instagram users who love to see their own photos on the Finfolk feed.\nThe company also asks questions, requesting its pod members to leave comments, and posts giveaways. Its most successful post included a long copy, heartfelt message written by the founders.\n5. Yoga-focused athletic apparel brand Lululemon (2.1 million followers) uses visually exciting content, shot in awe-inspiring locations, and motivational messaging to connect with its audience. The company walks the line between activewear and lifestyle, with a lot of content featuring regular people doing regular things -- cooking, woodworking, painting -- showing their passions outside of sweating. They build community around live events, festivals, and group activities.\n6. With more than 79 million followers, National Geographic is now the most popular brand on Instagram. Nat Geo proves that long captions, once considered an Instagram faux pas, just might be the new short caption. As a print publication dating back to the 1800s, National Geographic has taken digital media and social content by the horns, demonstrating that flexibility and innovation can make you No. 1.\n7. ASOS (6.2 million followers) uses individual accounts as sub accounts, working as brand ambassadors. This means more personality, more visibility, and more connection. The individual ambassadors are given a deal of autonomy, curating their own followers but tying everything back to the main brand page. Using personal accounts creates authenticity and relatability, which makes users more inclined to engage.\n8. Ah, Starbucks, the Instagram best practices model. One of the first brands to see the benefit in user generated content, Starbucks (14.9 million followers) reinvented itself using social platforms, taking content marketing to a new level.\nOnce ranked the second most popular brand on Instagram (behind Nike), Starbucks remains among the strongest at leveraging creative hashtags and sourcing user generated content. The company creates hashtags to promote new flavors and seasonal products, and users are more than happy to share its photos.\nNow that you've seen how some of the most successful brands on Instagram are using creative content to build their brands, what will you do differently? #getinstafamous\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n"

S'By Andreas Cremer and Irene Preisinger\nMUNICH - Volkswagen`s embattled brand Audi is facing the biggest reshuffle of its management board in years with four out of seven executives earmarked for dismissal, people familiar with the matter said.\nAudi, which is the biggest contributor of profits to Volkswagen (VW), is grappling with car recalls, prosecutor investigations and persistent criticism from unions and managers over the emissions scandal and its performance post-dieselgate.\nVW now wants top-level changes to prevent the luxury brand being weakened any further, one source said.\n"There has to be a clean break," the source said. "It cannot go on like this."\nAudi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler has been under fire for over a year for his handling of the fallout from the emissions crisis but the supervisory board extended his contract in May on condition he would not serve a full five-year term.\nInstead of ditching Stadler now, Audi\'s controlling panel is planning to replace finance chief Axel Strotbek, production chief Hubert Waltl, human resources chief Thomas Sigi and sales chief Dietmar Voggenreiter in the near future, three sources told Reuters, adding that successors had not yet been named.\nGermany\'s Manager Magazin reported on the planned reshuffle earlier on Friday, saying VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller had informed the four executives on Wednesday as part of an Audi board meeting about their imminent dismissal.\nVW and Audi declined to comment. Audi\'s works council, whose members occupy half the seats on the 20 member supervisory board, did not return calls seeking comment.\nAudi\'s labour boss criticised managers this month for lacking a roadmap for production in Germany after key models were assigned to foreign factories while its two main German sites wait to be awarded electric car projects.\nLast month, Munich prosecutors widened investigations at Audi after the German government accused the VW division of cheating on emissions tests in its home market.\n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Irene Preisinger; additional reporting by Jan Schwartz and Ilona Wissenbach; editing by David Clarke)\n'

S'Models along with designer Anita Dongre during the India Couture Week 2017\n New Delhi: \nDongre\'s love for trees could be seen at the ongoing India Couture Week here right from the time the stage was set for the Saturday show.\nApart from the trees-inspired runway, Dongre\'s new collection, which is a tribute to the Bishnoi tribe of Rajasthan, saw trees as a recurring motif of her collection.\nExplaining the significance of the tribe, the designer told IANS: "The Bishnoi tribe is most recognised for Amrita Devi and her village\'s sacrifice to save the \'khejri\' trees in the region."\n"It\'s this dedication and identification with nature that inspired me to both design this collection and plant a forest of 25,000 trees in the Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan."\nThe motifs and gota pati embroidery well translated the essence of the \'khejri\' onto silks.\n"A lot of the embroideries you saw tonight was done by Sewa women. They are the artisans who work in the villages. It\'s the first time that they have worked on a couture line for me," Dongre told reporters after the show.\nThe collection, which had saris, dresses with Obi belt, skirts with frills and more, had quite a white colour pallete. It also had deep hues of maroon, ink blue and olive green accented with red fuchsia and royal blue.\nWith dresses and lehengas having pockets, it was certainly a marriage between functionality and fashion.\nBut it wasn\'t just this marriage that fashionistas approved of.\nTowards the end of the show, a model in a bright red bridal lehenga accompanied by bridesmaids in white gowns and children in white halter neck gowns and a little boy in white kurta and dhoti with a Nehru jacket caught the audience\'s eye.\n"We have been doing a lot of marriages and I thought it was high time to do that on the ramp too," Dongre said.\n"I think it\'s lovely when brides have their own besties."\nThe male models were wearing traditional sherwanis -- "Classic and perfect for Indian weddings".\nIf the collection hit the right chord with the audience, the live music to which the models catwalked also got a thumbs up, especially when the Sufi singer sang the evergreen number "Dama dam mast qalandar" fused with varied instruments like electric guitar, tabla, drums and sarod.\n'

S'Modern Art, London presents a solo exhibition of new paintings by Katy Moran.\nKaty Moran\xe2\x80\x99s new body of work made during the past year reflects the continuing evolution of her approach to painting. While in the past, her work drew heavily on collage techniques, her new works employ a range of surfaces upon which paint is applied, including found paintings, glass, and frames. Color has entered back in to her work as a crucial component after what seemed to be a period of desaturation. She allows the composition to develop on its own, working with the canvas upside down to avoid dictating the form her images will take, resulting in works that have been compared to Cecily Brown and Willem de Kooning. Moran considers her work to have an important autobiographical factor.\nKaty Moran (b. 1975, Manchester, UK) lives and works in Hertfordshire. She completed an MA Fine Art in painting at the Royal College of Art, London, in 2005. Moran\xe2\x80\x99s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York, USA (2015); Parasol Unit for Contemporary Art, London (2015); the Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin, Ireland (2013); Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus OH, USA (2010); Tate St Ives, St Ives (2009); and Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, Middlesbrough (2008). Her work has been included in the recent exhibitions \xe2\x80\x9cContemporary Painting, 1960 to the Present: Selections from the SFMOMA Collection,\xe2\x80\x9d SFMOMA, San Francisco, CA, USA (2012) and \xe2\x80\x9cArt Now: Strange Solution,\xe2\x80\x9d Tate Britain, London (2008).\nThe exhibition is on view through August 19, 2017 at Modern Art, London, 4-8 Helmet Row, London EC1V 3QJ, UK.\nFor details, visit: http://www.modernart.net\nClick on the slideshow for a sneak peek at the exhibition. \n'

S'Two Samajwadi Party (SP) and a BSP member of the Uttar Pradesh legislative council on Saturday resigned from the house to what the sources said \'\'pave\'\' the way for the BJP ministers, who were not members of either of the houses, to get elected to the council.\nWhile the SP and BSP accused the BJP of \'\'luring\'\' their MLCs with "money power\'\', the latter rubbished the charges and said it had nothing to do with the resignations.\nSP MLCs, Bukkal Nawab and Yashwant Singh, who was a close confidante of controversial independent legislator Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, and BSP MLC Thakur Jaiveer Singh resigned from the house amid speculations that they might soon join the saffron party.\nSP supremo Akhilesh Yadav termed the resignations as an example of \'\'political corruption\'\'. \'\'After Bihar, the BJP intends to resort to political corruption in UP also,\'\' he said.\nBSP supremo Mayawati lashed out against the BJP and said that the latter could go to any extent for power. \'\'BJP is a danger to democracy,\'\' she said.\nAccording to the sources, the resignations could ultimately pave the way for some BJP ministers, who were not members of either of the houses, to get elected to council within the stipulated period.\nCurrently, five BJP ministers, including UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the two deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya, areneither members of the Vidhan Sabha nor the council.\nSources said that Sharma and two other ministers, including Mohsin Raza and Swatantra Dev Singh, were likely to opt for council rather than contesting assembly by-polls. It was not yet clear if Adityanath and Maurya would also take the council route or contest the assembly polls.\nBukkal Nawab, who is considered close to SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, claimed that some more SP MLCs could resign in the next few days. He, however, did not elaborate.\n'

S'Image used for representation purpose only.\n HYDERABAD: In a little over a year, the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) in Telangana has lost about 10 tigers. These big cats have either gone `missing\', or have been poached or have `returned to Maharashtra\' from where they came in the first place, as some forest department officials say.Irrespective of the reasons for their disappearance, the startling fact remains that their vanishing has resulted in a whopping `2,500 crore loss to the state in just the past one year. The loss does not stem from failing wildlife tourism, which is practically non-existent in the state, but from the economic value each tiger contributes in terms of `ecosystem services\' that the forest provides. \n As per a report prepared by the Indian Institute of Forest Management for the National Tiger Conservation Authority , each hectare of forest in a tiger reserve is worth anywhere between` `50,000 to `1,90,000 just in the ecosystem services such a forest provides. \n  For each tiger that is protected, it works out to something to the tune of `250 crore a year in accumulated benefits -which is the amount a state will need to spend to replicate the services provided by the forest, that is fully protected. \n "The idea is that when the tiger is protected, the forest is protected better. For instance, a forest like Kawal can give the state economic benefits worth Rs 10,000 crore a year," Imran Siddiqui of Hyderabad Tiger Conservation Society said. \n However, in Telangana, with the entire government machinery focused on just one fo restry related activity that of planting trees as part of the Haritha Haram programme - it is believed to be hurting protection activity in the tiger reserves. Every forest department official has been deputed to plant saplings to meet the goal of increasing tree cover in the state."Nowhere else in the country are staff in tiger reserves deputed for any other duty . Their only purpose is to protect the tiger and create conditions in the fo rest for them to multiply. It is only here that the staff are asked to everything else other their primary job," a source explained. "The approach of planting more tree so `vaanal aathe, kotul jaate\' may sound interesting and may even be useful but staff in wildlife sanctuaries, especially tiger reserves, should be exempted from tree planting activity and asked to instead focus on protecting the tigers," another source said. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S"New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): From attractive packages to beautiful experiential stays, we bring you the most attractive of them all, so now Grooowwllll!\nBehold, the majestic cat makes his way across the terrain ever so stealthily. One of nature's magnificent creations at its best, you can't help but awe at the persona and the mysteries that surround these graceful species.\nTiger reserves and national parks not only offer you a thrilling experience to watch these big cats relax in their habitat, but they also portray nature at their ultimate best.\nOn International Tiger Day 2017, Paytm Travel and Wandertrails brings you a list of a few places where the probability of spotting these majestic cats is very high.\n- Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Bhutan: The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is well-known for two reasons - for the philosophy of Gross National Happiness and for its awareness for conservation of wildlife and wilderness. Tiger safaris in Bhutan are very popular. The best way to spot the majestic cats in Bhutan is an explorative hike into Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, near the beautiful Wamling village. You can also explore the dense forest and wilderness around Mo Chhu River to enjoy the wealth of wildlife in Bhutan.\n- Chitwan and Bardia National Park, Nepal: Nepal is a place for all level of nature enthusiasts. Not only variety of flora and fauna, the national parks in this mountainous country boast of incredible landscape. Safaris around Chitwan and Bardia National Park also provide a panoramic view of the lush grassland. Located about 100 kilometres away from Kathmandu, Chitwan is well-known for its populations of tigers, leopards, sloth bears and over 500 one-horned rhinos.\n- Siberian Tiger Safari: The remote parts of Russia, especially the forest reserve of Durminskoye, are home to the last remaining Siberian tigers. The Tiaga forest of far eastern Siberia & Amur are a prime habitat for about 400 Siberian tigers and Amur leopards that are the rarest big cats in the world. The Siberian Tiger Safari is one of the most unique experiences for wildlife enthusiasts.\n- Sundarbans Reserve Forest, Bangladesh: This popular destination located in the southwest of Bangladesh, has a huge number of Bengal tigers - more than about two hundred. Here, you won't be signing up for safaris in jeeps but in canoes, and that's what makes this safari experience unique. Sunderbans is well-known for its men eating tigers and swamp tigers that have a unique characteristic of swimming in the saline waters and walking on mudflats.\n- Kanha National Park, India: Kanha National Park instills nostalgia because the landscape here is straight out of Rudyard Kipling's 'Jungle Book'. The 'Jungle Book' was set here, which makes this park a stomping ground for Mowgli. The park has large open meadows where chances of spotting tigers, are high. The safari here is breathtaking, and as the Park has two entrances, you can drive from one side of the park to the other. The picturesque scenery make this place a must-visit for nature enthusiasts.\n- Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand - One of the older reserves and among the first to come under Project Tiger, Jim Corbett is home to a healthy tiger population with ample spotting opportunities. Wandertrails has various jungle stay options like Vanghat that is in close proximity of the reserve and combines the stay with safaris into the park. A key differentiator would be the knowledgeable guide who would lead the tiger spotting expedition.\n- Pench, Maharashtra - MP border: Home to the supermom tigress Collarwali (owing to her being the first tiger to be radio collared), who recently gave birth to the seventh litter of cubs. She has borne 26 cubs in 7 litters between 2008-2017. The tigers here can be slightly hard to pin down and hence you would need a bit of lady luck to spot these cats. We have a beautiful stay - Kohka in Pench which gives you the best of the jungle and what the land has to offer.\n- Bandhavgarh National Park, MP - Visit the Bandhavgarh fort set on a cliff and then head towards the national park. Pug marks and distant growls will greet you as this is home to a large tiger population. Tata zone 1 would be your best bet to spot these cats and marvel at them. A stay entwined with nature combined with a visit to the hills and the fort and a safari with a wildlife expert and enthusiast is in the offing.\n- Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan - One of the most famous tiger reserves in India, Ranthambore has 3 lakes that exist within the sanctuary. Watering holes being a prime spot for catching a glimpse of tigers, especially in the summer, your safari would cover these. Do not be surprised to find a streak (group) of tigers satiating their thirst by the lake. You can stay on an organic farm stay near Ranthambore and go tiger sighting. As close to nature as it gets.\n- Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Karnataka - Joined Project Tiger as early as 1974, and is known for its sizeable tiger and elephant population. The park is a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Stay in a jungle lodge here and go on a jeep safari. Keep that camera handy.\n- Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, Karnataka - Falling in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Nagarhole also boasts of a healthy tiger population. Stay in the jungle and hear the growls and prowls of the wild as you sleep.\n- Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, Assam - Equally known for its tiger population and the one-horned rhinoceros, this is a must-visit. The beauty of Assam and the roar of the tigers blend into an eclectic ambrosia for you to feast on. A homestay would complete the experience for you.\n- Tholpetty Wildlife Sanctuary, Wayanad - Lesser known with virgin jungles and more known for its elephant population, you could spot tigers here. Incidents of tigers trespassing in the tribal colonies are also known here. A homestay away from the jungles and a safari at dawn could be the best option here. (ANI)\n"

S' AGRA: Firozabad businessman Sanjeev Gupta, who had been missing for the past week, was finally traced to a hotel in Panipat, Haryana late on Friday evening. On Saturday, Firozabad senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Kumar said prima facie the theory of kidnapping looked suspicious, and police were interrogating Gupta to find more about the case. \n "We have come across some evidence which casts doubt on whether Gupta was abducted for ransom. We will reveal more about the case after the completion of the interrogation process," Kumar said, addressing a press conference on Saturday. \n  Police said acting on a tip-off a joint team of the special task force (STF) and the crime branch set a perimeter around Swarn Mandir hotel in Panipat and caught hold of Gupta at the hotel\'s entrance. \n Gupta, who runs a school and other businesses in the district, had gone missing on July 22. His disappearance was followed by his family getting a ransom demand for Rs 100 crore. Gupta\'s wife had got an FIR registered against one Neeta Pandey, her husband Pradeep, who is a clerk in the social welfare department, and a third person for "abducting" her husband. Interestingly, Neeta too had got a case registered against Gupta two months back for allegedly duping her of a huge amount of money. \n The police had been suspecting the abduction theory from the start. "Nobody witnessed the incident and we have been trying to gather details with the help of CCTV footage. The family is pointing fingers at a couple known to Gupta for a long while," SSP Kumar had said earlier. \n As many as six teams of Agra STF, Firozabad crime branch and local police had been continuously working on the case. \n Gupta also remained tightlipped about the events of the past week. When asked who abducted him and how he reached Panipat, Gupta said he had told everything to the police, but did not elaborate. \n IG (Agra zone) Mutha Ashok Jain, who announced a reward of Rs 15,000 to the \n investigating teams, said, "Gupta has told us a story, but is not able to substantiate it. The entire allegation of abduction and ransom demand is suspicious. The case is still being worked out." \n Following his disappearance, Gupta\'s wife Sarika informed police that a message demanding ransom of Rs 100 crore was sent to various family members. The sender allegedly threatened to kill the businessman if they informed the police. \n'
