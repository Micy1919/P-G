VThe Supreme Court of Liberia has blasted the National Election Commission (NEC) for applying delay tactics in the administratively hearing of crucial elections matters brought before it mainly by the ruling Unity Party. The Supreme Court stands comes after the Commission's lawyer Frank Musa Dean openly confessed that they took 10 days to hear and dispose of a single application for a subpoena filed by the Unity Party, while only two days were used for Liberty Party to complete its production of witnesses and evidence. With just eleven witnesses been completed by the Unity Party, it lawyer Cllr. Benedict Sannoh has filed a Bill of Information against the NEC informing the High court that the Board of Commissioners are delaying in making a final determination into an appeal filed 10 days ago and without such ruling it cannot proceed with the case. Chief Justice Francis S. Korkpor said NEC should be going through a sleepless night to make sure that election matters before it are expeditiously investigated. Justice Korkpor said he wondered why the Board of Commissioners will take ten days to decide on a matter that is before it on an appeal process. Justice Kabineh M. Ja'neh for his part said the appeal was announced by the UP more than one week ago. He asked whether it was practical and logical for the Commission to make a determination in an appeal for more than that time. Justice Philip A. Z. Bank said even though the Constitution gives the NEC 30 days to hear and dispose of election cases, it was not sensible for the Commission to wait for the entire Constitutional period to elapse before it rule in a matter that is before it on appeal. "Are you saying that because the Constitution gives you 30 days you will take the whole time firm to rule on a case?" He asked the Commission's lawyer Frank Musa Dean. We told you to handle the case expeditiously you cannot be taking the entire 30 days time firm to decide a matter. Cllr. Sannoh wants the court to closely follow the Commission with an Eagle Eye because it using legal technicalities to prevent the expeditious hearing of the case. Meanwhile, the Court has announced Friday, November 17, 2017 to make final ruling in a Bill of Information filed by the Unity Party against the National Election Commission.

V2 minutes ago | Business & Finance. As part of efforts to mobilise revenue to spearhead national development, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has rolled out a sensitisation programme to reach out to the tax-paying public. The programme, which is a sequel to the national tax campaign launched in Accra recently is to among others create tax awareness and education to the tax paying public especially those in the informal sector to honour their tax obligations to the state. Employees of the GRA went on a float through the central business district of Takoradi popularly called the market circle amidst brass band music to tease the business community out to the programme. Speaking to the media after the exercise, an Assistant Commissioner at the Takoradi GRA Small Tax Office (STO), Mr Peter Ben Baah appealed to prospective tax payers to register with the GRA calling on debtors to the authority to also settle their outstanding debts. He warned against tax evasion and called for an agreement between the GRA and businesses on the mode of payments. A Medium Tax Payer Officer (MTO) at the Takoradi office, Madam Lysbeth Martin-Peprah who spoke to the GNA on the sidelines, said GRA had trained mobile workers to collect taxes with a record system(database) which monitor all tax payers to honour their tax obligations, disclosing that about 500 tax payers under her outfit in the Western Region, honoured their tax obligations to the state. Responding to agitations by some tax payers on the 3 per cent new tax regime introduced by the government, she said the GRA would continue to intensify its education on the need to pay the new tax rate and warned that tax payers who refused to pay their taxes at a stipulated period, would pay interest, have their offices or shops sealed off or be arraigned before the law court.

V Massive inducement of voters with money has characterised the ongoing Anambra state gubernatorial election. Voters collecting bribe.  The inducement which was reported at several polling centers, ranged from as low as N500 to N2000.  Some voters at Okpuno Hall, Awka south LGA, complained of attampts by some party agents who attempted to bribe them with N500 to switch their allegiance in favour of their candidate.  This reporter also ran into a boisterous crowd at the All Saints Primary School, along Ifite Amudo road, where Awka ward 2 is located, sharing N500 to voters who had cast their votes.  Attempt by the reporter to take a photograph of the incident incurred the wrath of the angry people who mobbed him and insisted on deleting the photograph.  It took intervention of security operatives who wrestled him from their grip and also secured \u200bthe release of his phone.  At Umuramma Sq1, Awka ward 5, units 1 to 6, where there was a large turnout\u200b of voters, a particular party was said to have shared N200 to each voter who voted in its favour.  One of the voters\u200b who gave her name simply as Florence, confided in the reporter that she has to \u201ccollect her own share of the cake,\u201d for her effort to defy the sun to vote.  A group of voters at Nkwo polling centre, were also caught on camera struggling to receive their own inducement in form of money and soft drinks.  When contacted, the Head of Voter Education and Publicity of INEC in the state, Mr. Leo Nkedife, directed the reporter to contact the Commission\u2019s hot lines, for security operatives to be deployed there. .

VIndie developer Among Giants has announced that their music driven adventure title, Distortions, will be arriving on Steam and the Windows Store early 2018. This award winning title takes players to a strange world where music, magic and memories create a beautiful landscape. A new trailer can be seen below that showcases the beauty of this title. In Distortions  players takes the role of a girl who wakes up in a strange world, it is a world where she must learn to make peace with her past and one where the laws of time and gravity no longer apply. Armed only with her violin and journal players will need to find their way through this world, using music to shape the terrain and protect from the strange masked creatures that inhabit the land. With the assistance of a strange masked man players will solve the mystery of the journal, overcome her past troubles and leave the strange land for a happier future. \u201cDistortions is a music-based project that goes well beyond game mechanics and the world itself. Music has driven the whole concept forward, before a single art asset was put in place,\u201d says Thiago Girello, CEO of Among Giants. \u201cFrom the start, we wanted to make a game that would use music as the connective tissue between narrative, environment, and language. Before development began, we researched all the types of music Distortions will feature, what kind of \u2018vibe\u2019 they provide, and what stories they tell. With all this prior research, the rest was actually pretty straightforward!\u201d. Look out for Distortions early next year.

VThe presidential hopeful was speaking at the South African Communist Party\u2019s Red October Rally in Mpumalanga. South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa speaks during a lecture at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore October 7, 2016. REUTERS/Edgar Su. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the first step to economic transformation is the eradication of corruption. "We transform it (the economy) firstly by ending corruption in our ranks. We must do whatever we can. When we end corruption...then companies will invest in our economy," Ramaphosa said. "We must transform ourselves, we must transform the way we work, we must transform the economy. We must make sure that there is a rule of law in our country.We must be people who will follow the rules.". The presidential hopeful was speaking at the South African Communist Party's Red October Rally in Mpumalanga on Saturday. The event was attended by national and provincial leaders of the SACP, Cosatu, Sanco and the ANC. Minister in the presidency Jeff Radebe and ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu were also present. Ramaphosa said one of the reasons why the economy is in "dire straits" is because the country's public enterprises have not been "working as well as they should have". "We say it is disempowering our people and disempowering our economy...We want our economy to pump on all cylinders...it won't be able to do so unless we conserve our resources," he said. "Those resources that have therefore been stolen must be brought back. We are unable to effectively address the economic burden of the past because our resources have been wasted...We have to restore our people's confidence in our ability to take their struggle forward.". He also spoke about land expropriation, saying those who "stole the land" must have it returned. "We must make sure that the land is brought back to our people...Those who were removed from our land must have their land returned and those who stole that land must have that land returned back to our people," he said. Supporters from various branches in the province as well as members of the ANC's Women's and Youth Leagues packed the Nelspruit Rugby Stadium where the event was held, filling the stands and huddling together on the grass in front of the main stage. His presidential competitor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, also took her campaign to the province on Friday and Saturday. Dlamini-Zuma arrived in the province on Friday to meet with local traditional leaders in the KwaMhlanga region and continued on Saturday when she delivered the keynote address at an ANCWL rally in the same area.

VFact: We've never seen a braid we haven't liked, including the low plait that Camila Cabello wore to last night's Latin Grammy Awards. Rather than pulling her hair back super sleek, the singer's hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos curled Cabello's hair in loose waves in different directions and tousled it for more body before working on the plait. For extra volume and texture, he prepped the singer's damp strands by spraying L\u2019Oréal Paris' Advanced Hairstyle Air Dry It Wave Swept Spray ($6; walgreens.com) on her roots. Giannetos pulled Cabello's hair into a low pony, secured it, and wrapped a small strand around it to conceal the elastic band. Next, he divided the tail into three sections, braided it backwards, and tied it with a small clear elastic band. He finished the style by running a few drops of L\u2019Oréal Paris' Elivive Extraordinary Oil Treatment ($7; walmart.com) all over for extra shine. VIDEO: The Crazy Cost of a Lifetime of Beauty . The singer's makeup artist Allan Avendaño rounded out the romantic vibe of the singer's red carpet look with a soft, monochromatic pink makeup look that included a rose lip. He lined her pout with L\u2019Oréal Paris' Colour Riche Matte Lip Liner in Mattes It ($7; target.com), and then applied a coat of L\u2019Oréal Paris' Infallible Pro-Matte Gloss in Bare Attraction ($8; target.com). He finished with L\u2019Oréal Paris' Colour Riche Shine Glossy Lipstick in Polished Tango for a touch of shine. It's all about layering to create the perfect bespoke shade. . All in all, consider this your go-to holiday look. .

According to NPD, the Nintendo Switch once again sold more units in the United States for the month of October compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. This marks the fourth straight month that the Nintendo Switch was the best-selling console in the country, continuing its reign in the industry. Also impressive is the fact that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One actually came in third and fourth in hardware sales for October. The console that took second place was the SNES Classic Edition, another Nintendo product that was launched with massive hype. When sales of the Nintendo Switch and the SNES Classic Edition is combined with the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo said that its consoles accounted for more than two-thirds of all video game hardware sold in October. That is an amazing feat, especially coupled with the fact that Nintendo also topped the software side of the industry. Super Mario Odyssey Sales. The success of the Nintendo Switch in October was supported by the launch of Super Mario Odyssey. The open-world adventure was able to claim the throne as the fastest-selling Super Mario game ever in the United States. Super Mario Odyssey was also the best-selling game for the month of October, which is made even more impressive by the fact that it was only launched on Oct. 27. This meant that it was able to achieve the month's top sales figure in just five days in the market. Can Nintendo Maintain Momentum?. Through the massive success of the Nintendo Switch and wildly popular games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo is once again on top of the video game industry. The big question, meanwhile, is whether Nintendo will be able to maintain its momentum heading into the holiday shopping season. The Nintendo Switch supply shortage has been viewed as a crucial factor that has actually held back the hybrid console's success. Nintendo, however, has promised that there will be enough Nintendo Switch units to go around in the holiday season, with Nintendo Switch production to ramp up to 30 million units in its next fiscal year. The Nintendo Switch, however, was only launched in March, so it is not likely that there will be discounts for the hybrid console in Black Friday 2017. The popularity of the hybrid console will be severely tested, as PlayStation 4 deals and Xbox One deals are plenty in the upcoming holiday season.

VMehdi Bennani led all the way to claim victory in the Opening Race at WTCC JVCKENWOOD in Macau as Championship title contender Norbert Michelisz was involved a crash that stopped the action.  Sébastien Loeb Racing-run Bennani made a perfect start from his reverse-grid DHL Pole Position and was never challenged in his Citroën C-Elysée WTCC, as Macau veteran Tom Coronel consolidated his second place on the grid with the runner-up spot for ROAL Motorsport. .  \u201cIt\u2019s such a challenging circuit and it\u2019s great to put my name with the likes of Schumacher and Senna as a winner at Macau! Thanks to everybody!" .  The race around the 6.120-kilometre track came to an early end after Castrol Honda World Touring Car Team driver Michelisz clipped a wall. His Honda Civic WTCC blocked the track, leaving Esteban Guerrieri, Rob Huff, Tom Chilton and the rest of the field with no way to pass. There was no option but to red flag the race and results were called after five of the scheduled eight laps. Behind Bennani \u2013 who also won the WTCC Trophy for independent racers \u2013 and Coronel, Ryo Michigami claimed a maiden podium, the first in the WTCC by a Japanese driver, with third place in his Honda Racing Team JAS Civic. He finished ahead of Thed Björk, who restored his 16.5-point championship lead in his Polestar Cyan Racing Volvo S60, having dropped two points to Michelisz in qualifying on Friday. Björk\u2019s main title rival Michelisz was still classified fifth from eighth on the grid despite his accident. Honda team-mate Esteban Guerrieri was sixth ahead of Main Race DHL Pole Position setter Rob Huff. The Briton and eight-time Suncity Group Guia Race winner started ninth and overtook RC Motorsport\u2019s Kevin Gleason to make progress on a circuit where it is famously difficult to pass. Fellow Briton Tom Chilton was eighth in his Sébastien Loeb Racing Citroën, while Nicky Catsburg took ninth in his Polestar Cyan Racing Volvo. The Dutchman holds third in the standings but is now 1.5 points ahead of Bennani, who moves up to fourth overall. Gleason rounded out the top 10 with John Filippi and Yann Ehrlacher next up. .

VDar es Salaam. The anti-poaching task force in Kigoma Region on Friday, November 17, arrested Mr Maneno Tanu over allegations of killing two elephants last month. Reports from the region say the suspected poacher, who has been on the run for several weeks after he allegedly killed the two elephants, was arrested following the collaboration of Friedkin Conservation Anti-Poaching Unit, Kifura Game Post Wardens and Kasulu police officials. An anonymous source from Kigoma told The Citizen on Friday, November 17, that the suspected poacher was arrested at about 5am after informers tipped off the anti-poaching team about Mr Tanu\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cThen, the task force stormed his residence and arrested the suspected poacher and seized some firearms,\u201d he told this paper. He named the confiscated firearms as a locally-made gun and a submachinegun (SMG). Others are a full loaded magazine and 98 SMG bullets. According to the source, Mr Tanu was taken to Kasulu District Station, where a case with registration No KSL/ IR/ 3699/2017 was registered. The suspect is being charged with the killing of two elephants three weeks ago. \u201cHe is still with us at Kifura for questioning. Later, we will transfer him to Tabora, where a special anti-poaching task force is situated,\u201d he noted. Kigoma regional police commander (RPC) Martine Otieno confirmed the arrest. \u201cI can\u2019t provide detailed information as I\u2019m travelling back from Kibondo,\u201d said Mr Otieno in a telephone interview.

VPost-2009 stock-market returns looking unrealistic, San Francisco Fed paper finds. What goes up... A popular measure of valuing stocks looks set for a decline, and stock returns will suffer because of it, according to new research published Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings, or CAPE, ratio is the inflation-adjusted value of the S&P 500 index divided by the real earnings of companies in the index averaged over the most recent 10 years. . Going back to 1881, big run-ups in the CAPE ratio\u2014usually from the advent of new technologies including high-speed rail, automobiles and the internet\u2014were met with substantial decline in stock prices. The quarterly average CAPE ratio stands at around 30, exceeded only by the peak values of 43 in 2000 and 31 in 1929, according to a paper from San Francisco Fed research adviser Kevin Lansing. Lansing compared the CAPE ratio against different economic variables to determine whether it\u2019s signaling that stocks are overvalued. So far, the answer isn\u2019t really\u2014the actual CAPE ratio is about 8% above where a regression model that includes the natural rate of interest, potential GDP and core inflation suggests it should be. It was 40% above the fitted ratio in early 2000, at the peak of the internet bubble. But the projected path of that model implies a 13% decline in the CAPE ratio over the next 10 years. \u201cAll else being equal, stock returns in this case would be lower than those observed since 2009 when the CAPE ratio was doubling. Investors who expect high stock returns in the coming years based on recent market experience may end up being disappointed,\u201d he wrote.

VPhoto: winam. Thanksgiving and other holidays are a beautiful excuse to spend hours in the kitchen making a huge meal from scratch. But if you want to carve out a little time for yourself\u2014to sleep in, watch the dog show, or just not cook for a few blessed moments of the day\u2014dinner rolls are the perfect corner to cut. It\u2019s great to have bread with your Thanksgiving meal\u2014and to have it on-hand for leftovers sandwiches\u2014but it\u2019s hardly the main event. (I think the sides are the main event. Sides and pie.) And The Kitchn has some easy tips for making perfectly okay store-bought dinner rolls taste great:. Serve them warm. You can put them in the oven, wrapped in foil, right next to the turkey, or microwave them under a damp towel. . Brush on melted butter. This works best with oven-warming\u2014just do it before the buns go into the oven. Top with fresh herbs. Finely chopped rosemary, sage, thyme, or oregano make this an excellent upgrade. (The butter you just brushed on will help them stick.). Sprinkle with flaky salt. Do this right before serving (and go with unsalted butter for trick 2) and you\u2019ll get a bonus texture and flavor pop. Now just remember to let the butter you serve with your rolls has come to room temperature, too.

VDuke of Cambridge opened up about his skills in the kitchen during a public engagement today. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge is presented with a gift of little chef outfits for Prince George and Princess Charlotte from Sean Tompkins (right), CEO of RICS, during the launch of LandAid's Pledge150 campaign, at the RICS on November 17, 2017. Prince William has revealed his favourite meal to cook, after helping judge a charity cook-off involving breakfast mackerel. William, 35, who admitted his culinary skills aren't quite up to scratch, joked: "I do like cooking but I'm not very good. And someone told me this was a bake-off, not a mackerel-off. I was expecting to get some chocolate cake.". He then joined former MasterChef winner Steve Groves, who is now head chef at Roux, on judging two competing teams of chefs from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the charity LandAid at a champagne breakfast raising money for young homeless people. The Duke of Cambridge got chatting to television presenter Angellica Bell, the 2017 Celebrity MasterChef winner, and she asked the royal what his signature dish was. He told her: "I like a roast. So a bit of roast chicken or a steak. I like it medium rare. I like it quite alive.". Sadly, his pregnant wife Kate Middleton \u2013 who is expecting the couple's third child in April \u2013 can't indulge in William's special dish due to being unable to eat undercooked meat until she has given birth. William eagerly judged the teams on their mackerel with citrus dressing, sesame seeds and heritage carrots. He didn't fail to entertain the audience by inspecting one dish and saying: "Is there anything on that?". Prince William, Duke of Cambridge observes a cook-off involving beneficiaries of the charity during the launch of LandAid's Pledge150 campaign. In the end, the team of LandiAid's chief executive Paul Morrish and Sean Marsay \u2013 a 26-year-old former homeless man from Scarborough, Yorkshire \u2013 were declared the winners by Groves, with input from the second-in-line to the throne. The event was in aid of raising £2.25m for LandAid \u2013 a property industry charity that helps small organisations attempting to combat youth homelessness. It's no wonder that Prince William was disappointed with the mackerel feast, as it has been reported in the past that he has quite a sweet tooth, and is a big fan of chocolate cake. He even requested it for his groom's cake at the royal wedding in 2011. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.

VChallenges with card readers have been a recurring problem at various local governments in the ongoing Anambra state governorship election. A notable case is that of Eri Primary School, Otuocha, where Willie Obiano, governor of the state and aspirant of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), cast his vote. The card reader failed and the governor had to undergo manual accreditation before voting. In Njikoka local government area of the state, all three card readers in the polling unit were not working as at 10:45am. Officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were said to be waiting for replacements. Similarly, in Ichida Ward 1, Umuezesue Hall in Anaocha LGA, accreditation and voting were delayed due to card reader hitches. In some polling units in Idemili North and Onitsha North, the INEC assistant presiding officers found it difficult to operate the card readers. Other places that have had card reader problems between 8am and 10:40am are polling units in All Saint Primary School Onitsha North, Amawbia I in Awka South local government area and Nkwelle Primary School, in Awka South local government area. However, there are cases of polling units where the smart card readers are functioning well, case in point, Akwu-Egbo Central School, Uruagu-Otolo, Nnewi, among others.

VSamsung's latest device bearing the model number SM-J250F/DS that might just be Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) was accidentally confirmed by the company's South African division on November 16. The local unit launched a support page for the yet to be launched Android device. Samsung, however, hasn't confirmed anything on the technical specifications yet but the fact that SM-J250F will possess dual sim variant for specific territories has been confirmed. . Geekbench's database also released the international version of the device along with the technical specifications. Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) will be powered by Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 430 SoC. The model is said to come with 1.5GB to 2GB RAM with 32 GB internal space and a microSD card slot. . It is all geared up to feature Android 7.1.1 Nougat enhanced with Samsung Experience software suite. Since Samsung's software support for the Galaxy series has been a bit tipsy when upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo is concerned, there is no confirmation on the fact that Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) might sustain the Oreo upgrade. . The device is powered by octa-core SoC and can operate at a maximum frequency of 1.4 GHz which is the standard frequency for Qualcomm. . The accidental confirmation of Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) came right after another wing of Samsung released news about Galaxy A7 (2018). The Kazakhstani division of the company accidentally launched a support page for the device tagging it as SM-A730F/DS. It will have dual sim capability but all the versions might not support the same features. It might contain the Infinity Display panel present in the Galaxy S8 lineup and Galaxy Note 8 along with being IP68-certified with complete water and dust resistance. The device is all set to feature a 6-inch screen with Exynos 7885 SoC and 6 GB RAM. Galaxy J2 Pro will be launched by early 2018. .

VAdam Matos may face the death penalty after his conviction on Thursday - Representational image. A Florida man who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend in front of their son before killing her parents and her new boyfriend has been found guilty of four killings. Adam Matos may face the death penalty after his conviction on Thursday (16 November), the Daily Mail reports. According to police reports, the 32-year-old first shot his ex Megan Brown and her father Greg Brown before battering Megan's mother and her new boyfriend, Nicholas Leonard, to death with a hammer at their Hudson home on 28 August, 2014. While confessing to his crime, Matos described how horribly he killed the four. He claimed that a combination of self-defence and "paranoia" drove him to murder them. Matos also did not show any remorse for leaving his then four-year-old autistic son at the crime scene while he went out to buy a shovel to bury the bodies. The bodies were found stacked four-high on a berm alongside a nearby road. He was arrested on 5 September, 2014 at a Tampa Bay area hotel with his missing son. In the court room, he described that fateful day of August 2014 as the "worst day of my life, a horrible experience, like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from", the Tampa Bay Times reported. Born in Philadelphia, Matos lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and New York City. He reportedly said he met Megan when he was 18 and she was 16 and after knowing each other for some months, she became pregnant with his child. But Megan's parents reportedly convinced her to move with them in Hudson and she told Matos she was taking their child. It was then that he decided to make the move. "I tried to convince her to stay. Tristan was born there, he had friends there, he was going to school, and there were beautiful parks he could go to there. It was a great place to raise our child," Matos had said. Local media reports said after the killings, the child was adopted by a new family.

VWinston George, 57, sexually assaulted the dementia sufferer at her home (Picture: Thames Valley Police). A man who sexually assaulted an elderly woman suffering from dementia in her own home has been jailed for nine years. Winston George was visiting the woman when he launched the attack which only stopped when a family member walked in and stopped him from leaving until police arrived. The woman, who was unable to tell George his advances were not wanted, died since the attack seven months ago. The 57-year-old was convicted by a jury after he denied one count of penetrative sexual activity with a mentally disordered female. Mr Recorder Peter Guest sentenced George to nine years in jail, following a four day trial at Amersham Crown Court,. The 57-year-old was convicted by a jury after he denied one count of penetrative sexual activity with a mentally disordered female. (Picture: Google). A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: \u2018On the afternoon of April 12 last year George visited the home address of the victim, a vulnerable elderly woman with dementia. \u2018George had sexual activity with the victim. During the offence he was disturbed by a family member who called the police. \u2018Winston was arrested at the scene and following an investigation was charged on June 7 this year. Detective Constable Kay Dickinson said: \u2018This was a distressing case to deal with for all those involved. \u2018The victim was extremely vulnerable because she had dementia which rendered her unable to refuse sexual activity with Winston George. \u2018Sadly, since the offence the victim has died but I am satisfied that justice has been done for her and her family. \u2018I want to thank the victim\u2019s family for their support, the witnesses who gave evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case to court and the jury who listened to all the evidence and delivered a unanimous guilty verdict.\u2019.

VDamian Green arrives at Downing Street in London. Extreme pornography found on the Commons computer of Deputy Prime Minister Damian Green was made illegal just a few weeks after it was discovered by police in raid on Green's office in November 2008. Laws regarding the possession of violent, hardcore porn were changed on 26 January, 2009, eight weeks after the raid. The Sun reports that some of the images found were so extreme the police sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) about whether to press charges. There were no grounds for prosecution given the raid took place before the law was changed. It's not clear who was responsible for downloading the material. A source told the tabloid: "Porn was being accessed on an almost virtual daily basis. Police were told nothing could be done. "Quite simply, it was not illegal to be in possession of extreme images before January 2009. If the raid had happened a few weeks later it would have been.". The raid was conducted as part of an investigation into government leaks. Green insists he was not the one who downloaded the images, and doubled down on this in a statement sent to The Sun: "As I have said throughout I did not put or view pornography on the computers taken from my office.". The change in the law was made after a four-year campaign led by the parents of 32-year-old Jane Longhurst, who was murdered by a man who was found in possession of violent images of simulated murder and rape. In January 2009, it became illegal to access porn that featured life-threatening acts (simulated or not), depicted sex with animals or corpses, or involved injury to a person's genitalia. Green, who was shadow immigration minister at the time of the raid, has been under pressure to resign since the story was reported last week, and is now the subject of a Whitehall investigation into his conduct. The investigation was ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May after Green was accused of sexual misconduct by journalist Kate Maltby, an accusation he has called "untrue and deeply hurtful".

VIt's a common dilemma: you want to open a new bottle of wine, but you only plan on drinking a glass or two. Some wine experts say it's best to finish the whole bottle within 24 hours for the freshest taste, and it's a bummer to pour another glass the following week only to realize it's gone bad. A solution that's becoming more common is the idea of letting people buy wines by the glass \u2014 in places other than restaurants. And a new company called Standard Wines, which launched on Nov. 17, makes this concept more accessible to wine-lovers everywhere. . From the founders of Vinebox, the wines-by-the-glass subscription service, Standard offers a red and a white wine, each made in California and packaged in a 187-milliliter bottle that's, might I add, quite chic. Each bottle (aka glass) translates to one 6.3-ounce pour and costs $8. Right now, Standard Wines are available to order online (starting in packs of six), and they'll roll out to Whole Foods stores around the country in coming months. . "As options for alternative formats increase, it seems the median level of quality is dropping in correlation. It's our mission to remove the compromise associated with smaller formats and deliver generous, quality wines to everyone in an easy-to-enjoy, noncommittal, single-serving size," the company said in a press release. If you're into the idea of reaching for a one-and-done glass of wine whenever you feel like it (and not worrying about finding a bottle stopper when you're done), keep reading to learn more about this new company's offerings before you see them in stores. .  Standard Red . The red wine from Standard is a Sonoma-sourced blend made with Syrah, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, and Zinfandel grapes. With "dark red fruit flavors," this California wine's tasting notes include blackberry, dark chocolate, and violets. Image Source: Standard.  Standard Chardonnay . Standard's white wine is a 2014 Chardonnay that has "a restrained yet present amount of oak." Made with all Chardonnay grapes, a glass of this will yield flavors of green apple, lemon creme, and honeysuckle. Image Source: Standard.  Standard's Pour Size . This nifty little graphic is a helpful reminder about how much wine certain pours typically include. A tasting portion is two ounces, a restaurant pour is usually five ounces, and a glass from Standard measures at just under six and a half. Image Source: Standard.

VFormer \u200bg\u200bovernor of Ebonyi, Martin Elechi, has revealed why he left People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) for All Progressives Congress (APC). In his address in Abakaliki on Friday, Elechi said that he defected to due to \u201cinjustices and lack of internal party democracy\u201d in the PDP. Elechi, who accused Govenor Dave Umahi of insensitivity to plight of the ordinary Ebonyi citizens, said that APC government would right the wrongs and restore value to governance in the state. He critised the Umahi administration for its intolerance to credible opposition views, attack on press freedom, crippling the economy with needless loans and penchant for abandoning existing projects in preference for unrealizable elephant projects. His words: \u201cThe change we all clamour for is finally here with us; we are heralding the dawn of a new era in the Ebonyi body polity. \u201cThe APC has come to salvage the decaying political values caused by the mis-governance of one man who has lost focus of what political leadership and governance entails. \u201cA man who prefers to embark on unrealizable elephant projects that have no direct bearing on the lives of the people. \u201cWe built an international market with about 8,000 lock-up shops which is still not given out to the market men and women who need these shops and our Governor embarked on construction of shopping mall. \u201cThe Governor abandoned Oferekpe gigantic water scheme and we hear that he is now embarking on construction of tunnel while our children are out of school due to the inability of parents to pay their school fees and pensioners being owed months of arrears\u201d. In attendance were APC National Chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, Minister for Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Acting chairman in the state, Eze Nwachukwu among other chieftains. Elechi\u2019s wife\u200b,\u200b Josephine\u200b,\u200b 6,000 other former PDP\u200b members,\u200b including \u200bex-Deputy National Chairman, Chief Solomon Onwe joined Elechi in defecting. \u200b\u200bOther d\u200becampees included Chief Edward Nkwoagu, Labour Party 2015 governorship candidate, former Senators, former House of Representatives members, Commissioners, Special Assistants, Permanent Secretaries and local government chairmen.

VA National Super Alliance (NASA) senator has revealed how the coalition plans to swear-in their leader Raila Odinga as the fifth President of Kenya. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala said that Nasa will use the recently controversial amendments on election laws passed by Jubilee party MPs in Parliament to install the opposition leader as the head of state. The senator said that Jubilee shot itself in the foot by amending electoral laws to allow any judge to swear-in the President. \u201cWe shall keep this rogue government on its toes. I assure you that what Jubilee lawyers are advising the government is complete nonsense. They will be surprised because it looks like they have forgotten what their MPs recently passed in Parliament in our absence. He added: "They allowed any judge to swear in the President and we may be forced to remind them the same at the right time,\u201d he conveyed. "Kenyatta\u2019s legitimacy remains questionable since he went to polls alone and ran against himself.". \u201cThe Jubilee government\u2019s actions are dangerous to any leadership. I am cautioning them that what they are doing out of anger would cost them dearly,\u201d he added. NASA leaders have been threatening to swear-in Raila should President Uhuru go ahead to take Oath of Office for his second term. Led by Siaya Senator James Orengo, the NASA leaders have vowed not to recognize Uhuru as president. "We will shock them. They will know that you can have power and the guns, but you cannot rule over a people that have refused to obey your leadership. We will use August 8th results to swear-in NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga if Jubilee tries to use October 26th poll results to swear-in Uhuru,\u201d Orengo stated.

V3 minutes ago | Sci/Environment. Dr Thomas Anyorikeya, the Bolgatanga Municipal Director of Veterinary Services, has congratulated the government for its plans to improve the agricultural sector under the 2018 budget, saying it was a good move. The Government through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), will next year, distribute 70,000 small ruminants (goats and sheep) to 2,000 livestock farmers to boost meat production, Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, the Minister of Finance said during the 2018 budget hearing to Parliament on Wednesday. Dr Anyorikeye who spoke in an interview with the Ghana News Agency in Bolgatanga said a similar programme was carried out about eight years ago with a loan from the African Development Bank and some farmers selected from six regions benefited from 40,000 small ruminants. He said the new programme was a positive one and called for evaluation of the previous one to inform decisions on the implementation and success of the new one. He said government ought not to rush and called for situation analysis to be conducted to find out if beneficiaries of the last programme passed on the offspring of the animals to other farmers who were to benefit as well under that programme. He however assured government of commitment on the part of the Veterinary division of MoFA, to support and ensure that the programme was successful, adding that the programme was in conformity with other key sectors of the economy. Mr Ofori - Atta said the Ministry will support six National Livestock Breeding stations to produce and distribute 200 cross bred heifers, 1,700 improved pigs and 100,000 cockerels.

VGANJAGOLD. Researchers have found that heavy drinking and smoking can cause fast ageing. An analysis of drinking and smoking patterns revealed a consistently heightened risk of looking older than one\u2019s true age. According to the observatory findings published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, light to moderate drinking didn\u2019t affect biological ageing. The researchers have studied more than 11,500 adults since 1976 when the study began. The participants \u2014 aged between 21 and 93 (men and women) \u2014 were tested on their lifestyle, general health, and the state how much they drank and smoked. This was before they were checked for four signs of ageing: earlobe creases; a greyish opaque coloured ring or arc around the peripheral cornea of both eyes (arcus corneae); yellow-orange plaques on the eyelids (xanthelasmata); and male pattern baldness (receding hairline or a bald patch on the top of the head). Arcus coneae was the most common sign of ageing among both sexes, with a prevalence of 60 per cent among men over 70 and among women over 80. The least common sign was xanthelasmata, with a prevalence of 5 per cent among men and women over 50. Receding hairline was common among men, with 80 per cent of those over the age of 40 affected. According to the scientists: \u201cThis is the first prospective study to show that alcohol and smoking are associated with the development of visible age-related signs and thus generally looking older than one\u2019s actual age\u2026.This may reflect that heavy drinking and smoking increases general aging of the body.\u201d.

V© Ian KINGTON / AFP Arsenal's French manager Arsene Wenger reacts to their first goal on the touchline during the English FA Cup final football match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Wembley stadium in London on May 27, 2017. LONDON - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his side's intensity had been the decisive factor in their 2-0 victory over north London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Quick-fire first-half goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexis Sanchez at a drizzly Emirates Stadium earned Arsenal a first win over Tottenham since March 2014. It was Arsenal's 11th successive home victory in league football and left them a point behind Spurs, who finished above them last season for the first time since 1995. "They had the urgency, the desire and the focus," Wenger said. "In a derby like that, that plays a part. We didn't lose the defensive focus for 90 minutes.". Wenger also hailed the display of German playmaker Mesut Ozil, who departed to a standing ovation late in the second half after an uncharacteristically battling performance. "I'm convinced that Mesut Ozil adds physicality to his game and when he needs it, he can produce it," the Frenchman told Sky Sports. "He got a standing ovation because he added to the team's defensive job. He's not a specialist in that, but he can do that because he's an intelligent man.". Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was unhappy about the free-kick that led to Mustafi's 36th-minute opener, which was awarded for a challenge on Sanchez by Davinson Sanchez that looked clean. Mustafi was also narrowly offside as Ozil struck his free-kick and Arsenal profited from the benefit of the doubt in a possible offside call against Alexandre Lacazette prior to Sanchez's goal. "You saw what happened during the game," Pochettino said. "I'm disappointed because the small details were against us, which makes it difficult to win.". Asked about which "small details" he was referring to, Pochettino replied: "The free-kick. And I think it was offside. "In this type of game, when you play against a top-six side like Arsenal, the small details change games and put the game on one side.". Wenger said: "I don't see where the referee's decisions went for us. For me, the foul (by Sanchez on Sanchez) was a foul. "I can give you plenty of games since the start of the season when we had bad luck.".

VWhich company will be the biggest in America, 100 years from now? Judging by the chart below, it\u2019s fair to say it may not be Apple . This chart from cost-calculating website HowMuch.Net uses Forbes data to identify which American companies were the top corporate giants over the past century. The size of the circle in the visualization corresponds to the company\u2019s valuation, adjusted for inflation to 2017 dollars. Companies are color-coded by industry. . As Raul Amoros for HowMuch.Net points out, the top 10 companies in each year are all different. In 1917, U.S. Steel reigned supreme, while in 1967, IBM was king. The year of 2017 has been dominated, no surprise, by iPhone maker Apple, which recently became the first public company to cross the $900 billion market capitalization milestone... and looks to be on the path toward $1 trillion (or even $2 trillion???). . One major takeaway from the chart is that today\u2019s tech giants are huge and valuable on a scale that we\u2019ve never seen before. In 1967, IBM was worth $258.6 billion, adjusted for inflation. That\u2019s a long way off from Apple\u2019s $900 billion perch today. . \u201cThe massive steel monopolies from a century ago pale in comparison to the size of tech companies today,\u201d writes Amoros. . \u201cThis suggests that the internet has concentrated financial power in the boardrooms of only a handful of companies like never before. This is one of the many reasons why tech companies have to worry about regulators busting up their monopolies,\u201d he says. But if the one constant on lists such as these is change, as Amoros says, \u201cYou can be sure that the top ten companies in 2067 will look substantially different than today, and just imagine what the list will look like in 2117.\u201d .

V Can the name be real? It is such a perfect movie-star name, like something that could be on a '40s marquee. How fitting, then, that Ryan Reynolds has the same loose-limbed charm as Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. He's the Everyman, but somehow with more of everything: wit, elegance, looks and general hunkiness. . TIME 100.  Of course, in the real world\u2014for us, this was often at 6 a.m. in a makeup trailer\u2014Ryan is also rumpled, kind, committed and generous, especially to women. He likes them in the most simple, direct, unadorned way: for their humanity. (How very appropriate that he is the father of two girls.) He has a natural wit, which he often turns on himself, and he can balance his private and public life with great dexterity. He is open and generous, but never inappropriate. I suspect this is part of what makes him such an appealing performer. .  When we were shooting the movie we did together, Woman in Gold , Ryan was about to start his now legendary journey toward becoming Deadpool . That movie's incredible success was so deserved, and it was brought about by Ryan's singular commitment, energy and imagination. I loved Deadpool . But I also miss spending time with the actor who played him\u2014his warm, intelligent, inquisitive brown eyes, his readiness to laugh ... sigh. .  P.S. The name is real, like everything else about Ryan. . Mirren is an Oscar-winning actor.

VLogic's hit single "1-800-273-8255" is not only the first top 10 record of his career (it peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 30) but also his first single to hit at radio, reaching No. 1 on Mediabase's Top 40 chart. Yet, according to the 27-year-old Def Jam MC, the record, co-produced by 6ix, wasn't crafted with hit potential in mind. "I had given up on trying to make a hit or trying to be accepted or go to radio," Logic told DJ DUBL in an interview earlier this month while in the United Kingdom on the European leg of his Everybody's Tour. "I gave up and made this album that I thought not this many people would appreciate\u2014and they have. But, I just can't believe it's this song. It's a song about mental health and battling depression and continuing to live and survive. And it's bigger than myself, it's bigger than you, it's about us as a whole. And the fact that is the song I can flex on as a rapper, like, 'Double Platinum, motherfucker,' that's amazing, that's so special.". In addition to somewhat unintentionally becoming the biggest record of his career, "1-800" has also had a profound effect on suicide prevention awareness and is teaching hip-hop fans all around the world to be less skeptical of wokeness. Since its release on April 28, "1-800" has racked up 395 million streams on Spotify. The Andy Hines-directed video for the single, released nearly four months later, is currently sitting at 145 million views on YouTube.  Like this article?

VWindows automatically suspends your USB devices when they aren\u2019t being used. This helps save power, but may cause problems with some USB hardware. Your USB devices will use more power if you disable this feature, but it can fix peripherals that stop working properly after Windows suspends them. You should only change this setting if you\u2019re having problems with a USB device in Windows. If your USB peripherals work properly, there\u2019s no reason to disable USB suspension. This setting is part of the power plan options on Windows. Whether you\u2019re using Windows 7, 8, or 10, you\u2019ll need to change it from the Control Panel\u2019s power plan window. Head to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options to find these settings. Click \u201cChange Plan Settings\u201d to the right of the power plan you\u2019re using. Windows uses the Balanced plan by default, and you probably don\u2019t need to change power plans. But, if you are regularly changing power plans, you\u2019ll need to modify this setting for each power plan you use. Click the \u201cChange advanced power settings\u201d link here to open the advanced settings window. Scroll down and locate the \u201cUSB settings\u201d option in the list of advanced power settings. Expand this section and set \u201cUSB selective suspend setting\u201d to \u201cDisabled\u201d. Click \u201cOK\u201d to save your settings. From now on, Windows won\u2019t automatically suspend any connected USB devices. If you want to change back to the default settings and have Windows suspend USB devices to save power in the future, just return to this window and set the \u201cUSB selective suspend setting\u201d option back to \u201cEnabled\u201d.

VThe number of millionaires in the U.S. just hit an all-time high, a new banking report finds. In its annual report on the state of global wealth, Credit Suisse says 1.1 million new millionaires were created in the U.S. in 2017. That brings the total number of millionaires in the U.S. up to approximately 15,356,000, or about one in every 20 Americans. The rise in the stock market is the biggest reason for the gains, which in turn were driven by both stronger underlying economic conditions and the prospect of lower taxes and deregulation, Credit Suisse reported. \u201cWealth per adult has now fully recovered [from financial crisis lows], and is 30% above the 2006 level,\u201d the bank says. \u201cThere is some uncertainty about future interest rates and stock market prospects, but otherwise the signs are mostly positive for household wealth.\u201d. Americans now account for 43 percent of the world\u2019s millionaires. Yet not everyone is benefiting from the booming global economy. Credit Suisse finds that across all global regions, wealth inequality has increased from 2007 to 2016. And in every region of the world except for China, they say, median wealth has actually declined. Despite its plurality of millionaires, the U.S.\u2019s median wealth of $55,876 puts it 21st place in the world, alongside Austria and Greece. The top 10 countries for median wealth were:. Switzerland: $229,000. Australia: $195,400. Belgium: $161,000. New Zealand: $147,600. Japan: $123,700. France: $119,700. Singapore: $108,900. United Kingdom: $102,600. Canada: $91,058. Taiwan: $87,257. Median wealth per adult favors countries with lower levels of wealth inequality, Credit Suisse said, and there is exceptionally high disparity between the rich and poor in the U.S.

VThierry Neuville leads the final round of the World Rally Championship season in Australia after his Hyundai team-mate Andreas Mikkelsen crashed on the second stage of the Saturday morning loop.  Mikkelsen, who was the overnight leader in only his third rally for the team, ran wide into a bank just over a mile onto the Newry stage. .  His i20 picked up a double puncture, but he carried just one spare tyre, meaning he was unable to continue in the rally. .  "It's devastating, but what can you do?" Mikkelsen said. .  "We are trying to push as hard as we can, sometimes you get away with it, but not today. .  "With our tyre choice, we didn't consider two spares. We were saving our tyres for later." .  The fast-charging Jari-Matti Latvala moved into second place for Toyota, just 6.3 seconds behind leader Neuville, after topping Newry. .  Neuville won the longest stage of the rally - Nambucca - but missed a junction on Newry and reported gearbox issues at the end of the stage as a result of his trip off the road. Hyundai is now changing the gearbox in the lunchtime service. .  Kris Meeke currently completes the top three, despite missing the same junction as Neuville and five-time champion Sebastien Ogier. .  Ogier was 20.6s off the leading time on Nambucca and a further 28.9s on Newry. He ended the morning in seventh place, just over 15s adrift of Hayden Paddon. .  Ogier's M-Sport team-mate Ott Tanak sits in fourth ahead of Rally Australia debutant Craig Breen, who is in an impressive fifth position in his Citroen C3. .  Stephane Lefebvre is eighth in the third Citroen. He spun and stalled on Newry but did enough to keep Rally GB winner Elfyn Evans at bay. The Welshman labelled the grip in the morning as "horrendously bad" on his DMACKs. .  Evans sits ninth in the overall classification with Esapekka Lappi rounding out the top 10. .  Leading positions after SS11 .

VNewcastle United have made a decent fist of things over the opening months of the Premier League season and have enough in the locker it would appear to stave off any sort of relegation worries lingering over the club. Manager Rafa Benitez appears to have a system in place which is working for his team, and despite a lacklustre summer transfer window, the Spaniard cannot be too disheartened with the options he has available to him in his squad. Our landlord here at the Tavern loves a good beer with the Toon Army, and this week they have been coming to the bar in their droves as they prepare for the return to Premier League action this weekend. Discussions however quickly turned to January and what the club should be looking to do, and our gaffer thinks it\u2019s time the the club moved striker Aleksandar Mitrovic on to pastures new. The big striker has divided fans during his time with the club and has also had a few injuries which haven\u2019t helped his cause at all. However, there can only be so much patience you can have with a player, especially one who\u2019s disciplinary record is far from perfect when he does play. Mitrovic cost the Toon a fair few quid a couple of seasons back, but has simply not hit the heights many thought he would, meaning his time could well be coming to an end at St James\u2019 pretty soon. He\u2019s still young enough to carve a good career out, it just appears his best days will not be with Newcastle. Toon Army, what do you think to Mitro? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!.

V\u2018If nothing is done between now and the budget presentation in February, then things will become a lot more difficult on the fiscal front\u2019. SA will face more fiscal difficulties and higher financing costs should state-owned companies\u2019 debt continue rising and if the nation\u2019s local debt is downgraded to junk, the International Monetary Fund says. If state entities such as cash-strapped power utility Eskom and South African Airways request more state support, the government will have to step in to help, removing fiscal space for "more socially useful activities", says Montfort Mlachila, the lender\u2019s senior resident representative in the country. "If the current fiscal problems are not addressed soon enough, it will obviously worsen the market sentiment and could increase the financing costs," he says. "If nothing is done between now and the budget presentation in February, then things will become a lot more difficult on the fiscal front.". Last month, Treasury almost halved its economic growth forecast for this year, to 0.7%, and said debt was predicted to rise. The deteriorating trajectory threatens to trigger a downgrade of SA\u2019s rand-denominated securities to junk by S&P Global Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Fitch Ratings already assesses the local-currency debt as sub-investment grade. SA projects a revenue shortfall of R50.8bn for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, and sees public debt exceeding 60% of gross domestic product by 2021. Despite the predicted widening fiscal gaps, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba did not want to "deviate irretrievably from the fiscal consolidation agenda", he said in his medium-term budget presented on October 25. The country has not approached the IMF for help, Mlachila says. "If SA were to come to the IMF, we would obviously be ready to assist.". The sustainability of the nation\u2019s debt would be at risk unless government presented a credible fiscal consolidation plan in 2018, Moody\u2019s said on October 30. The change in policy direction away from a focus on fiscal consolidation was faster than expected, Fitch said on October 26. Moody\u2019s assesses the nation\u2019s foreign-and local-currency debt at one level above junk and is scheduled to make an announcement on November 24. S&P, which is also due to review its reading the same day, has SA\u2019s rand debt at the lowest investment grade, and foreign securities at the highest junk level. Bloomberg.

V The Germany international played a key role as Arsenal beat Tottenham 2-0 in a one-sided north London derby and he was delighted with the display . Mesut Ozil was happy to contribute to a fine team performance after the German played a starring role in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Tottenham. First-half goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexis Sanchez secured Arsenal's first triumph over their local rivals in the last seven Premier League meetings. Spurs struggled badly to cope with the home side's front three, as Ozil combined brilliantly with fellow forwards Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette to torment the top flight's tightest defence. "Today, our aim was to do everything and at the end of the game we won. We are really happy," Ozil told Sky Sports. "We have good quality. Lacazette and Alexis are always dangerous. Especially today with Alexis' goal, he showed his quality and I'm really happy for him to score against Tottenham. "We\u2019re happy and the fans are happy.\u201d. 4 - Arsenal have never finished lower than 4th at the end of every Premier League season in which they\u2019ve beaten Spurs at home. Foregone. pic.twitter.com/QyKiZxjmqT \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 18, 2017. Ozil - who is out of contract at the end of the season - was the architect for the home side's opener in the 36th minute, as his free-kick allowed compatriot Mustafi to head home via a deflection off a post. . While replays showed the defender was fractionally offside at the point the ball was delivered into the penalty area, the goal was allowed to stand. "I was only happy they didn't blow the whistle. It happened to me once before against Chelsea, but this time I got away with it," a relieved Mustafi said. 2-0 - Arsenal have won 19 of their previous 20 Premier League games at the Emirates when they've led 2-0 at half-time - the exception was a 3-2 defeat to Spurs in November 2010. Warning. \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 18, 2017. "That's football. Sometimes you get things that go against you, but at the end of the year it's even. You get good things, you get bad things. At the end, it's all fair. . "If you have players who can put the ball in like that, you go in with belief. The most important thing when you go up for corners and free-kicks is believing you can score.".

VSingapore\u2013Singapore business community and a senior business delegation led by China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) exchanged views and shared insights on cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative at the Singapore-China Trade and Investment Forum held today ( November 13) in Singapore. Co-organized by Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and CCPIT, with the support of Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Business China, Chinese Enterprises Association and Singapore China Business Association, the forum attracted more than 200 entrepreneurs from China and Singapore. Important topics, including trade and investment opportunities through enhanced partnership and cooperation, Singapore as an internationalization hub for Chinese Companies, as well as investment and financing opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative were shared by experts and speakers from both Singapore and China government agencies and business communities. \u201cIntensifying business collaboration and project partnership with the Chinese enterprises to develop infrastructure along the Belt and Road countries are crucial for Singapore enterprises that focus on internationalization as the key strategy to sustain their businesses in a volatile economy\u201d, said Mr S.S. Teo, the Chairman of SBF in his welcome speech during the forum. \u201cTogether with SBF, CCPIT is committed to co-build a pragmatic platform to enhance cooperation between the business communities of the two countries in all fields,\u201d said Mr Jiang Zengwei, Chairman of CCPIT, adding that the two sides wish to make a significant contribution to infrastructure development under the Belt and Road Initiative. Together with the high level business delegation are members of Singapore-China Business Council (SCBC) established by SBF and CCPIT in 2016 to strengthen business relations and trade between Singapore and China. The first SCBC meeting held prior to the Singapore-China Trade and Investment Forum, marked a dynamic phase of closer Singapore and China collaboration to map strategies, particularly in relation to working as catalysts and partners in the Belt and Road Initiative. \u201cPositioned as the gateway to ASEAN markets, our Chinese counterparts recognize the importance of partnering Singapore enterprises to intensify the progress of the BRI initiative. The multiplying benefits to key stakeholders involved in projects under development will boost economic and social growth in the region\u201d, added Mr Teo. The Forum is part of SBF\u2019s activities under the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI), in support of the BRI Connect Platform \u2013 an online and offline portal positioned as an aggregator and catalyst for infrastructure development driven by BRI. BRI Connect is expected to benefit Singapore professional service providers whose core competencies will greatly benefit key stakeholders involved in current or new projects. (End).

VPREMIER LEAGUE football returns today with all the big clubs back in action - and Starsport brings you the best betting tips. Arsenal vs Tottenham: Both sides to see out a draw in the north London derby. Arsenal vs Tottenham (12:30pm). The Gunners host Spurs in today\u2019s early kick off unbeaten in their nine games at the Emirates Stadium this season. Arsene Wenger\u2019s men have won all their Premier League games on home soil but I expect Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s in-form side to end that run. Spurs haven\u2019t lost to the Gunners since September 2015 and should get something from today\u2019s game. Starsport tip: Draw and both teams to score (10/3 with Betfair). Liverpool vs Southampton (3pm). Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side have failed to beat Southampton in their last five attempts, with their last win coming in February 2015 in the EFL Cup. The two sides saw out two goalless draws in the Premier League last season. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see another low-scoring game at Anfield with Saints expected to park the bus. Starsport tip: Under 2.5 goals (6/5 with Betfair). Arsenal 1-1 Tottenham. West Brom vs Chelsea (3pm). Chelsea travel to The Hawthorns looking to make it four Premier League games on the bounce and face a West Brom side in dreadful form. The Baggies are without a win in their last 10 games across all competitions, losing their last three league games. This should be an easy one for the champions. Starsport tip: Chelsea to win to nil (7/5 with Betfair). Manchester United vs Newcastle (5:30pm). Jose Mourinho\u2019s side have won all eight of their games on home soil this season, conceding just once with a weakened side in the Carabao Cup win over Burton. And this should be a routine win for the Red Devils considering Newcastle\u2019s form. The Magpies have won just one in their last six outings in the Premier League - a 1-0 win over rockbottom Crystal Palace. United need to clinch all three points today in order to keep up with Manchester City in the title race and could be 11 points adrift should they beat Leicester earlier in the day. Starsport tip: Manchester United to win to nil (5/6 with Betfair).

Guests enjoyed musical performances, an outdoor cocktail reception, a custom-built carousel and doughnuts from local favorite District Donuts. Williams and Ohanian were spotted in New Orleans a few weeks before, when they were planning the big day. Engaged in Dec 2016, the happy couple dated for over a year before they made it public \u2014and welcomed their first child, Alexis Ohanian Jr., in September. As reported by People , in early November, the 23-time Grand Slam champion gathered with her friends and family for an all-out girls weekend in New York City. The ladies went to the opulent Baccarat Hotel & Residences, the first hotel from France's eponymous crystal brand, the luxurious weekend included five-star spa treatments, trapeze'ing, tea brunches, and dancing out on the town. \u201cI felt like a door had been opened to a person who made me want to be my best self,\u201d Ohanian told Vanity Fair about Williams who he met in Paris. \u201cI find myself just wanting to be better by simply being around her because of the standard she holds.\u201d. A huge congrats to the happy couple! .

VA Plumtree man allegedly killed his grandfather and his uncle\u2019s wife using a knobkerrie and an axe after accusing the pair of being involved in an illicit sexual relationship. After the alleged double murder, the suspect, Jonathan Sofaya Ncube, had been on the run until his arrest on Tuesday when he reappeared from his hideout which is believed to be in neighbouring Botswana. Ncube of Mhlotsha village under Chief Tshitshi in Mangwe appeared in court yesterday facing two counts of murder. He was not asked to plead by Plumtree resident magistrate Mr Taurai Manwere. Ncube was remanded in custody to November 29 and was advised to apply to the High Court for bail. In his warned and cautioned statement, Ncube admitted killing the pair in February this year saying he was irked by their illicit sexual relationship. \u201cI admit committing the crime. I committed the offence because I was angry that they were having a love affair when they were related,\u201d he said. Prosecutor, Ms Rose Sibanda said on February 18 this year, Ncube approached his now late grandfather, Mr Leonard Sofaya Ncube, at his homestead in Mhlotsha area of Mangwe. He accused him of having a sexual relationship with his uncle\u2019s wife, who is also now late, Ms Sibukile Mpofu. A misunderstanding arose and Ncube allegedly picked a knobkerrie and hit Leonard once on the back of the head and he fell down. The court heard that he then took an axe and allegedly struck him on the right ear and he died on the spot. After allegedly killing him, he left the homestead. On his way, he met Ms Mpofu and confronted her about the same matter. Ncube then allegedly hit her on the back of the head with the axe and she died on the spot. Since committing the crimes, Ncube has been on the run until his arrest on Tuesday.state media.

Carles Puigdemont (right) and Oriol Junqueras during a session of the Catalan parliament on October 26, 2017 (AFP). Jailed and exiled figures from Catalonia's separatist movement feature prominently in party lists unveiled by the region's pro-independence factions, ahead of elections called for December 21. Of the 14 members of the Catalan government who were dismissed by the central government in October, 12 are on the two main separatist lists, the "Together for Catalonia" group of sacked president Carles Puigdemont and the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), led by his vice president Oriol Junqueras. Seven of the former officials, including Junqueras, are currently jailed pending an investigation into charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, while Puigdemont and four others are in Belgium fighting an extradition request filed by Spain. Prosecutors in Brussels asked a judge Friday to extradite Puigdemont and the others, and a new hearing has been set for December 4. But a final decision could still be months away, as both sides are expected to appeal if the judge rules against them, which means Puigdemont might be out of the country when the Catalonia vote is held. Junqueras and the others being held may be released before the election. Puigdemont presented on Twitter the lists backed by his conservative PDeCAT party, saying the candidates supported "independence, the republic and freedom", as well as the restitution of the regional government and "a return of political prisoners and exiles". He had hoped to form a united separatist front for the new elections, as was the case in the region's last elections in 2015, when the pro-independence camp secured a majority of 72 seats in the 135-seat parliament. But the ERC rejected a joint ticket, and opinion polls suggest that while it is leading in the current campaign, which officially opens on December 5, the independence coalition as a whole could lose its absolute majority. The polls indicate a tight race against the "Constitutionalist" bloc which favours Spanish unity, which includes Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party (PP), the centrist Ciudadanos and Catalonia's Socialist party. Madrid has imposed direct rule on the once semi-autonomous region since the independence declaration made after a banned referendum on October 1, and called the new elections in a bid to "restore normality". Regional authorities said 90 percent chose to split from Spain, though less than half of eligible voters turned out in a region deeply divided on independence.

VMalcolm Young, whose crunching guitar provided the rhythmic backbone of AC/DC for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at the age of 64. Young, who co-founded the Australian hard rock band with his younger brother Angus in 1973, stuck with the band -- and, by most accounts, served as its leader -- until he retired in 2014. His retirement was prompted by the onset of dementia. The band confirmed Young's passing in a statement posted to its Facebook page. The post also includes a second, more personal statement from Angus himself. "As his brother, it is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special," Angus wrote. "He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever.". "Malcolm, job well done.". A separate statement from the Young family, shared by Australia's SBS, confirms that Malcolm died peacefully on Saturday with his family at his side. "Renowned for his musical prowess, Malcolm was a songwriter, guitarist, performer, producer and visionary who inspired many," the statement read. "From the outset, he knew what he wanted to achieve and, along with his younger brother, took to the world stage giving their all at every show. Nothing less would do for their fans.".

V(File photo). Marondera \u2014 Farmers who benefitted from the government's controversial $500 million command agriculture scheme have failed to repay loans after selling their produce to middlemen, an Agritex official has confirmed. The low rate of loan repayment by the farmers has forced the government to put in place new stringent requirements for all the beneficiaries of the 2017/18 programme, the government official said in an interview. Under the command agricultural programme, beneficiaries were expected to deliver their harvested maize to the state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB), where the government was expected to recoup its expenses from. However, according to an Agritex official based in Marondera, a huge number of farmers were unwilling to service their loans and sold their grain to middlemen who offered instant cash. The middlemen went on to resell the maize to the GMB at a higher price. Last month, Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is heading the programme, confirmed that the government had only received $60m from farmers who had repaid their loans through the GMB. The failure by the farmers to honour their debts had forced the government to put in place new stringent requirements for all farmers applying for new loans for the 2017/18 farming season. "We are receiving various reasons from the farmers on why they failed to repay their loans," he said. "Some are citing loss of their crops to veld fires, poor yields due to late disbursements of inputs or lack of adequate rains. A number are even claiming they are still harvesting their maize, but need inputs to prepare for the next season.". Although the Agritex official could not give figures on how much the government was owed, he confirmed that farmers who had failed to service their loans had reapplied for new inputs. "Inputs for the coming farming season are being allocated to farmers who have fully repaid their loans and those people applying for inputs for the first time. We are also working on recovering outstanding amounts from the farmers who fail to repay the loans. "As a result, few farmers are meeting the new requirements as we want to avoid what happened in previous arrangements when farmers received government loans and inputs, but failed to repay and nothing was done to recover the loans.". Since its launch last year, the command agriculture programme has been dogged by numerous challenges, including theft of inputs by farmers and government officials, disagreements among government ministers over the programme's implementation and late disbursements or non-delivery of inputs to farmers.

VCharge your phone with the same kind of battery that powers your Tesla. Tesla dropped an electric semi truck and a new Roadster at a recent event, but it apparently launched another product that didn't get any stage time. The automaker has released, of all things, an external battery pack (the Powerbank) with USB, microUSB and Apple lightning connections that can charge your Android phone or iPhone on the go. Maybe that's not as strange as it sounds, considering Tesla has a Gigafactory that pumps out batteries, including one for homes called Powerwall. In fact, the Powerbank uses a single 18650 cell with 3,350mAh capacity that's also found in its Model S and X electric vehicles. (Obviously, though, the cars are powered by more than one cell.).  But you likely wouldn't buy a $45 battery pack with those specs if it weren't designed by Tesla when there are numerous cheaper alternatives. That's probably why the company made sure it looks like a Tesla product through and through. It was designed after Tesla Design Studio's Supercharger monument and wouldn't look out of place inside one of the EV-maker's cars. Unfortunately, you can't get one anymore, no matter how much you're willing and able to shell out $45 for the portable battery: it's already marked sold out on the company's website. You'll just have to cross your fingers and hope Elon Musk and his team decide to produce another batch.

VLIVERPOOL -- Sadio Mane will start for Liverpool on Saturday afternoon against Southampton, while Joel Matip misses the game through injury. Mane was a doubt for the Anfield encounter after he was sent home from international duty early when he "slightly felt his old [hamstring] injury," according to the Senegalese Football Federation. However, following a fitness check on Friday, the 25-year-old has been named in the starting XI and will partner Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in Liverpool's forward line. Matip, meanwhile, has been ruled out with a "knock" sustained this week, according to Liverpool, and will sit out his first Premier League match of the season. He had played every minute of Liverpool's league campaign in 2017-18 until Saturday, but will not be risked against Mauricio Pellegrino's side. \U0001f4cb Our team to face @SouthamptonFC... pic.twitter.com/Jj1KNhBczt. \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) November 18, 2017 .

VWood furniture is particularly beautiful because it creates a warm and inviting atmosphere while also being elegant. It\u2019s classical and extremely popular. However, wood is not the best material when it comes to durability and maintenance. Most often, wood tables will get heat stains as a result of being extensively used. The stains are very unaesthetic and most people seem to think they are impossible to remove. You will be pleased to know that there is a way of removing them. Heat stains appear as a result of placing hot dishes directly on the surface of the table. What\u2019s interesting is that heat can also make them disappear. There are a few ways of doing that. One would be to take an iron and apply heat directly to the cloudy stains and they\u2019ll disappear. Before that wash the surface and dry it well. Take a clean, shite cotton towel and place it over the scorch marks. Place the iron on top of the towel, directly over the stain and let it sit for close to a minute. Make sure you turn the steam on because otherwise this will have no effect. The marks will disappear. Make sure you wipe the water and moisture immediately after. However, this is not a solution that is guaranteed to work in all cases. The effects might be different on another type of furniture. The finish might get damaged and the problem might even get worse. It all depends on the type of finish, the type of material or varnish. If you\u2019re afraid that placing the iron directly onto the table will make the damage worse you can just take the iron and hover over the spots to see what happens. You\u2019ll need steam for this as well. If you find this technique to be too aggressive and you do not want to try it at all, there are also a few other things that you can try and that might work. For example, you can mix 50/50 toothpaste and baking soda and rub in, make a paste of salt and olive oil and let it sit for up to an hour, mix 50/50 vinegar and olive oil and rub, use straight toothpaste, make a paste with baking soda and a few drops of water or rub some Vaseline into the mark and leave it overnight. Remember that there are just suggestions that did work in some cases but are not fully tested and guaranteed to work for all wood tables.

VDamian Green arrives at Downing Street in London. Extreme pornography found on the Commons computer of Deputy Prime Minister Damian Green was made illegal just a few weeks after it was discovered by police in raid on Green's office in November 2008. Laws regarding the possession of violent, hardcore porn were changed on 26 January, 2009, eight weeks after the raid. The Sun reports that some of the images found were so extreme the police sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) about whether to press charges. There were no grounds for prosecution given the raid took place before the law was changed. It's not clear who was responsible for downloading the material. A source told the tabloid: "Porn was being accessed on an almost virtual daily basis. Police were told nothing could be done. "Quite simply, it was not illegal to be in possession of extreme images before January 2009. If the raid had happened a few weeks later it would have been.". The raid was conducted as part of an investigation into government leaks. Green insists he was not the one who downloaded the images, and doubled down on this in a statement sent to The Sun: "As I have said throughout I did not put or view pornography on the computers taken from my office.". The change in the law was made after a four-year campaign led by the parents of 32-year-old Jane Longhurst, who was murdered by a man who was found in possession of violent images of simulated murder and rape. In January 2009, it became illegal to access porn that featured life-threatening acts (simulated or not), depicted sex with animals or corpses, or involved injury to a person's genitalia. Green, who was shadow immigration minister at the time of the raid, has been under pressure to resign since the story was reported last week, and is now the subject of a Whitehall investigation into his conduct. The investigation was ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May after Green was accused of sexual misconduct by journalist Kate Maltby, an accusation he has called "untrue and deeply hurtful".

VGetty Image. The NBA\u2019s eligibility rules for its youngest players may be changing very soon. The league is reportedly looking into changing the age restrictions that have forced young basketball players into the grips of the NCAA for more than a decade. . ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported late Thursday that the NBA \u2014 including commissioner Adam Silver and National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts \u2014 will begin talks to reshape the rule with the Commission on College Basketball. . With momentum gathering to reshape the one-and-done draft entry rule, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and NBPA executive director Michele Roberts met with members of the new Commission on College Basketball in Washington D.C., on Thursday, league sources tell ESPN. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) November 17, 2017. Wojnarowski reported the two met on Thursday with the commission, which is chaired by Condoleezza Rice and started in the wake of the FBI investigation into college basketball corruption.  Though it\u2019s something that will change only after it\u2019s negotiated through collective bargaining, it seems like the momentum is finally there to change the rule in some way that would presumably scale back the restrictions. . Nevertheless, there\u2019s a growing belief within the league that Silver\u2019s desire to end the one-and-done \u2014 the ability of college basketball players to enter the NBA draft after playing one year in college \u2014 could be pushing the sport closer to high school players having the opportunity to directly enter the league again. For that change to happen, though, the union would probably need to cede the one-and-done rule and agree to a mandate that players entering college must stay two years before declaring for the draft. The union has long wanted players able to enter the NBA draft out of high school, but they ceded that in the 2006 collective bargaining agreement. Many players have lamented the rule over the years. Terrance Ferguson is certainly not a fan of the one-and-done. Ben Simmons called the NCAA a \u201cdirty business\u201d last month, and even Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has said recently that he\u2019s for players being able to skip college and go straight to the pros. . But leadership in the NBA saying it needs to change is about as clear a sign that it\u2019s actually happening as we\u2019ve seen.

VTesla is making a new version of the Roadster sports car, Elon Musk announced Thursday night, and it looks spectacular. After the Tesla CEO spent half an hour onstage extolling the virtues of his new electric 18-wheeler, he stepped away and the lights went out. Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cSabotage\u201d came on the loudspeakers, and then the new Roadster rolled out of the very Semi he had just introduced, ripping around the massive lot where the trucks had been just a moment earlier. Musk promises insane specs from this new sports car. Zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds, quicker than the average Formula 1 car. A quarter mile in 8.9 seconds, in a world where \u201c10-second cars\u201d are coveted. Top speed somewhere north of 250 mph, putting it in the realm of the fastest production cars on the planet, like the Bugatti Chiron and Koenigsegg Agera. And to go with it, four seats (if you\u2019re traveling with two small people), decent cargo room, and 620 miles of range, thanks to a 200-kilowatt hour battery pack, about double what you get in the most capable Model S. Also, it's a convertible. No surprise the base price will be $200,000, and reserving your spot on the list will cost you $50,000. Considering that Bugatti is a seven-figure car, it's a pretty good deal.1. The Tesla CEO has long said he doesn\u2019t want to make the best electric cars around, but the best cars, period. Introducing this new wonderbeast, he took on a bolder tone. \u201cThe point of this is to give the hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.\u201d He also said it\u2019ll make driving a gas car feel like piloting a steam engine with a side of quiche. When you make cars this outrageous, you get to make up your own metaphors, apparently. The original Roadster was Tesla\u2019s first car, the proof of concept it built from 2008 to 2012. It was the young automaker\u2019s way of showing that electric cars could be cool, not just overgrown golf carts. People had long asked Musk when he would revive the model to go with his sedans and SUVs, he says. Now he\u2019s making it happen\u2014come 2020. A customary word of caution: Tesla has a history of over-promising and delivering late, if ever. Musk is struggling just to produce enough (now quaint-seeming) Model 3 sedans, the car that should appeal to the masses and make Tesla more than a niche automaker\u2014and finally make it profitable. A sports car won\u2019t fix its problems\u2014but it might make one hell of a getaway car.

VYou know you should be eating a salad with dinner. But it's such a pain to take out all the ingredients every single night, wash and cut them, and prepare your bowl of veggies. So you usually just say eff it and forgo the bowl of greens. If this sounds like you every night, here's a salad hack that will make those dinner salads happen. . All you need is about 30 minutes on Sunday night. Wash and cut all your favorite veggies, then store them in closed mason jars. Each night, take out the six or so jars and you've got a DIY salad bar. Buy a box of greens like mesclun, baby kale, or baby spinach, and keep some extra toppings on hand such as sunflower seeds and avocado, and your salad will take less then five minutes to make. . The jars will keep your veggies tasting crisp and fresh, and this hack will save you tons of time each night. Here's what you'll need:. 2 red peppers.  16-ounce bag of baby carrots.  2 yellow peppers.  2 bunches of celery.  1 large European cucumber or 2 regular cucumbers.  1/2 small red cabbage. Get creative with what you love in your salad bowl and see what you can prep ahead of time to make your life easier. You can wash and store a can of garbanzo beans, grill up some chicken, or marinate some tofu. Or cook up some quinoa or wash and store some grapes. Keep the containers in the fridge to grab with your other veggies and your salad is done!.

VFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Battery-powered cars are not ready for mass production yet, the chairman of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp told a German magazine, adding that he did not see U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla as a role model. "Battery-powered cars with a long range are very expensive and it takes a long time to charge them," Takeshi Uchiyamada was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel. "Such cars do not fit in our program.". Toyota in September established a venture to develop electric vehicle technology with partner Mazda, seeking to catch up with rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars. Both automakers are somewhat behind their peers, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market yet. This contrasts with Tesla, which late on Thursday unveiled an electric heavy duty truck as well as a new roadster. "Tesla is not our enemy and not our role model," Uchiyamada said. "I think it's the German manufacturers that rather see Tesla as a competitor.". BMW and Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicles, defying skeptics who say they will need more radical designs to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-up carmakers. Uchiyamada said that Toyota was working on a new type of solid-state battery that is able to store more power and can be recharged much more quickly than current types. "This technology will be a big development step. But that will still take time. We expect mass production in four to five years.". On Friday, Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corp said they had agreed to cooperate in selling electric vehicles in India from around 2020, aiming to give each other a leg up in emerging markets and in low-emission technology.

VLearner drink and drug-driving information courses should be incorporated into driving test requirements, according to a leading motoring lawyer. Frank Rogers, head of Just Motor Law, the motoring division of Kirwans law firm, is calling for an awareness-raising element to be introduced into learner courses to ensure that drivers are completely clear of the law around driving, drink and drugs. Speaking at the National Road Safety Conference, Frank spoke of his concerns that despite the introduction of new drug-driving legislation in 2015, many drivers still appeared to be passing their test with little or no knowledge of the effect that alcohol and drugs \u2013 including prescription drugs \u2013 could have on their ability to drive. \u201cDrivers who have been disqualified for at least 12 months for a drink-drive offence can be referred to a drink-drive rehabilitation (DDR) course, yet as it stands there is very little in place to educate new drivers about the dangers of driving while under the influence before they hit the roads,\u201d Frank said. \u201cDDR courses have had a remarkable effect on changing the behaviour of those convicted of drink driving offences, and I firmly believe that by introducing learner driver versions of these courses, incorporating additional information on drug-driving, new drivers will be far better prepared mentally to keep both themselves and others safe on the roads.\u201d. More than 1,300 people were killed or seriously injured in drink driving incidents in 2015, and the latest figures show that alcohol is to blame for 12pc of all road deaths. Road safety charity Brake also report that impairment by illegal or medical drugs was officially recorded as a contributory factor in 62 fatal road crashes and 259 crashes resulting in serious injuries in 2015 in Britain \u2013 but that experts believe that the true figure could be much higher. Frank said: \u201cAccording to the Department for Transport, offenders who attend a DDR course are 2.6 times less likely to re-offend. \u201cWith that in mind, I would urge the DfT to introduce learner drivers to their own version of such a course before they even hit the roads, in the expectation that the information retained would help drivers make informed choices when it comes to drink and drugs.\u201d.

VSOME election observers, who monitored the governorship election in Anambra on Saturday have expressed mixed feelings over the exercise, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports. Mr Samuel Itodo, the Executive Director, Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth, and Advancement (YIAGA), told the News Agency of Nigeria that materials and personnel arrived various polling units late. Itodo said 28 per cent of polling units recorded the arrival of materials and personnel as at 7.30 a.m., except in Awka North and Awka South Local Government Areas where materials and personnel arrive before 7.30 a.m. \u201cApparently, as at 10 a.m., 75 per cent of the polling units were opened while voting started about 30 minutes later. \u201cThat is disturbing but as at 12 noon, 92 per cent of polling units were opened. \u201cWe asked INEC to extend the deadline from 2 p.m to 4 p.m to enable people vote,\u201d Itodo said. The executive director also said there were issues with card readers being unable to authenticate fingerprints, saying the development raised the issue of integrity of the exercise. According to him, it is too premature to make statements on voter turnout. \u201dWe are still studying our data so as to make an official statement on that later.\u201d. On his part, Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chairman, Partners for Electoral Reform, said voting started late, especially in Ogbaru Local Government Area. Nwagwu said security agents have been civil and professional in their conduct, adding also that voters have equally behaved themselves. However, he said there were high cases of \u201cvote buying\u201d recorded in some parts of the state. Mr Harry Putker, an observer with the Embassy of Netherlands, said his group would make its observations public at a later date, which would include some minor challenges which INEC needed to work on. Another observer group, the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Election Working Group told NAN in Onitsha that the exercise began on a good note as the process started early with the arrival of materials. \u201cAll the materials, including ballot boxes, card readers, result sheets are intact and working in good condition,\u201d Coordinator of the group, Mr Adewale Ademola, said. He also commended the presence of security personnel, saying \u201ceverything went orderly and was transparent\u201d.

VIrvine Police Department asks Twitter for help. One of the most coveted items at this year's ComplexCon, the limited edition 'N.E.R.D' Adidas NMD Hu designed by Pharrell Williams currently resells for $4,500 to $6,000. Unfortunately, that kind of value appeals to lowlifes in search of a come up by any means necessary. That's apparently the case in a situation being investigated by the Irvine Police Department. Earlier today, the department's Twitter account summoned help in their search for two suspects, one of which is armed. It's believed that they robbed a local resident for his pair of the rare sneakers. The IPD even made sure to get the crimebusters over at Hypebeast on the case. We're looking for two suspects accused of robbing an Irvine resident of this pair of sneakers, valued at $6,000. One suspect was armed. @HYPEBEAST pic.twitter.com/Xjy4NihDzI.  \u2014 IPD (@IrvinePolice) November 17, 2017 . The police are working with a lead, though. According to the Twitter feed, the following is a video of one of the suspects recently shopping at Irvine Market. Here's video of one of the suspects, taken inside Irvine Market. @HYPEBEAST pic.twitter.com/2gLWX0NOLf.  \u2014 IPD (@IrvinePolice) November 17, 2017 .

VAlthough there's increased talk around the diagnosis and treatment of common mood and mental disorders like anxiety and depression, there's still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), for instance, is still almost exclusively associated with soldiers returning from active combat, despite the fact that it affects eight percent of Americans at any given time, according to PTSD United. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America notes that PTSD is the fourth most common mental health disorder affecting people in the US. . Considering how common of a mental health problem it is, POPSUGAR asked Dr. Rafael Euba, consultant psychiatrist at The London Psychiatry Centre, to clarify some prevalent queries regarding PTSD. What causes it?. While PTSD can be caused by traumatic events such as sexual assault, violent personal attacks, or witnessing extreme violence, Dr. Euba told POPSUGAR that PTSD can also be caused by "life-threatening medical diagnoses, such as cancer and other diseases where life expectancy is reduced, and traumatic treatment." PTSD can also be triggered by any event that causes you to feel fear, such as "emotional experiences of loss, abuse, or bullying at home or in the workplace.". What are the symptoms?. Much like depression and anxiety, symptoms of PTSD can be both physical and psychological, with "flashbacks, sweats, palpitations, heart racing, and sleeplessness" being the most overt symptoms, but Dr. Euba says you should also be mindful of behaviors such as "being on guard at all times, restlessness and irritability, or flashes of anger," as these may also be symptoms of PTSD presenting itself. Is PTSD similar to depression?. According to Dr. Euba, many suffering from PTSD often misdiagnose themselves with depression, but the two are distinctly different, with PTSD being caused by traumatic events and depression being triggered by a variant of life events that aren't limited to traumatic ones. Dr. Euba stresses that people be mindful of not dismissing a possible PTSD diagnosis as mild depression "because of the prevalence of depressive episodes" because it's common that "if you have PTSD, you can experience depressive symptoms," but the two are not interchangeable. . How is it treated?. Unlike depression, PTSD isn't normally treated with antidepressant medication, but if your symptoms include depressive episodes, depending on their severity, you may be prescribed with an antidepressant treatment to treat that first. PTSD-specific treatments include the two options of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, which respectively "helps patients to identify and cope with thoughts, behaviors, and emotions" and "helps to change the way traumatic memories are stored in the brain, making them easier to manage.".

She will continue her Mpumalanga campaign on Saturday, when she delivers the keynote address at a ANC Women's League (ANCWL) rally in the same area. Cyril Ramaphosa will also take his campaign to the province on the same day, delivering a keynote address at the South African Communist Party's 'Red October Rally' at the Nelspruit Rugby Stadium in Mbombela. The event will be attended by representatives of all members in the tripartite alliance. Mpumalanga is the second-biggest voting bloc in the country, with 736 ANC voting delegates attending the party's national conference from the province. The province is spearheaded by its premier, David Mabuza, who has not publicly revealed whom he supports in the presidential race. However, the ANCWL named him as their preferred candidate for deputy president on Dlamini-Zuma's slate. ANC members in the province were seen to be united behind Mabuza, but new reports suggest that branches are also voting the way of Ramaphosa. Both candidates will be seeking to entrench their support in the province this weekend.

V Mbule is determined to make an impression if he is given a chance ahead of Matsatsantsa's clash with the Ravens . SuperSport United\u2019s preparations ahead of their Caf Confederation Cup final first leg encounter has been severely hampered by injuries and suspensions to key players. Matsatsantsa go into the clash on Sunday afternoon without the suspended duo of Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Morgan Gould, but most recently they have been hit by a spate of injuries which saw them travel to Lubumbashi with just 17 players. The latest reports suggest that the exciting Thabo Mnyamane alongside the talented Teboho Mokoena have been forced to sit out the away leg due to injury. This will come as a heavy blow to coach Eric Tinkler\u2019s plans considering the disruption which the international break has inflicted. Nonetheless, SuperSport are certainly not short of talent within their ranks, and one such player who is determined to step up to the plate in place of Letsholonyane and Mokoena is youngster Sipho Mbule. The starlet who has only made a solitary appearance so far in this year\u2019s tournament, which came in the form of a substitute appearance against Zesco United, sates that he will jump at the opportunity to play in the final. \u201cI am really motivated for this game and it will be a great stepping stone in my career. If I play I will definitely give my all,\u201d Mbule told SuperSport.com. However, the 19-year-old admits that the prospect of playing against a true African powerhouse is daunting. \u201cI am a bit nervous, I think Mazembe have won it about three times, but I will try to do my best despite who is watching or not,\u201d he concluded.

V(NEW KENSINGTON, Pa.) \u2014 An intense search continued Saturday for a suspect in the fatal shooting of a rookie police officer. The shooting happened shortly after 8 p.m. Friday in New Kensington, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. Officer Brian Shaw, 25, was shot after a traffic stop involving an SUV led to him chasing someone on foot, authorities said. Police later recovered an older model of an unoccupied brown Jeep Grand Cherokee, wanted in connection with the shooting. Shaw had served as a part-time officer in three other towns before joining the New Kensington police force full time in June. He was taken to a hospital after the shooting but was pronounced dead there a short time later, according to authorities. Police officers from neighboring towns continued to scour the area for the suspect early Saturday. SWAT teams and police dogs assisted. A description of the suspect has not been released. Authorities planned to provide more details at a news conference Saturday.

VStrong demand is set to give a huge boost to renewable energy growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the next five years, driving cumulative capacity up more than 70 percent, a senior international energy official said Wednesday. From Ethiopia to South Africa, millions of people are getting access to electricity for the first time as the continent turns to solar, wind and hydropower projects to boost generation capacity. \u201cA big chunk of this [growth] is hydro because of Ethiopia, but then you have solar ... in South Africa, Nigeria and Namibia and wind in South Africa and Ethiopia as well,\u201d said Paolo Frankl, head of the renewable division at the Paris-based International Energy Agency. He forecast installed capacity of renewable energy in the Sub-Saharan region almost doubling - from around 35 gigawatts now to above 60 gigawatts, given the right conditions. Ethiopia has an array of hydropower projects under construction, including the $4.1 billion Grand Renaissance Dam along the Nile River that will churn out 6,000 megawatts upon completion. That is enough for a good-sized city for a year. \u201cAfrica has one of the best potential resources of renewables anywhere in the world, but it depends very much on the enabling framework, on the governance and the right rules,\u201d Frankl told Reuters on the sidelines of a wind energy conference. Coal industry opposition. The transition to a low-carbon trajectory to reduce harmful greenhouse gases is creating opposition from the coal industry and fueling uncertainty in countries where job creation was linked to coal mining. In Africa, this tension and its impact on new investment has been best illustrated by South Africa\u2019s state-owned Eskom and its reluctance to sign new deals with independent power producers, according to analysts. In May, the South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) said the energy regulator agreed to investigate Eskom\u2019s refusal to sign agreements that delayed 2,942 megawatts in new solar and wind projects. \u201cOur government does not appear to appreciate the forces of nature,\u201d SAWEA Chairman Mark Pickering said Wednesday. The inability of Eskom to sign the new power purchase agreements for two years has delayed investment of 58 billion rand ($4.03 billion), and hit investor confidence with at least one shutdown of a wind turbine manufacturing plant, said SAWEA. \u201cThe continent has a lot of potential, but the problem is financial and political issues, so all of our projects are being delayed for quite a long time, like with Eskom,\u201d said Mason Qin, business development manager for southern and eastern Africa at China\u2019s Goldwind.

VGerman won his second consecutive world championship with Ferrari with the F2001. The Ferrari F2001 that sold for $7.5m on display in New York. The Ferrari car with which Michael Schumacher won the 2001 Formula 1 world championship has been sold for $7.5m (£5.7m) to an unnamed buyer at an auction in New York on Thursday (16 November). Sotheby's had estimated the car would be sold for between $4m and $5.5m, but it instead fetched what is understood to be a record figure for a modern F1 car. Carrying the chassis number 211, the car was the one Schumacher drove as he won the Hungarian Grand Prix that season, clinching his fourth world title and the second consecutive championship with the Italian team. The chassis is also the one with which the German legend secured a win in the Monaco Grand Prix in the same season, which would turn out to be his final success in the Principality. Introduced at the beginning of the 2001 season, the Ferrari F2001 replaced the F1-2000 that had brought back the drivers' title to Maranello the previous season for the first time since 1979. The new car proved to be even better than its predecessor, with Schumacher claiming nine wins and five second place finishes from 17 races, while teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second and third five times each. Along with Schumacher's title, Ferrari also clinched a third constructors' championship in a row, to which they would three more until 2004. Such was the superiority of the F2001 that Schumacher and Barrichelloused it in the opening races of the following season, with the German winning in Australia and finishing third in Malaysia. Barrichello, meanwhile, also continued to race in the 2001 Ferrari in the early stages of the 2002 season, but suffered three consecutive retirements and subsequently switched to the F2002, with which he would win four races and claim six podium finishes. Overall, the F2001 retired with an outstanding record of 19 podiums in 20 races, including 10 wins. The car started from pole position in 13 occasions and led 18 of the 20 races it took place in, making it one of the most successful F1 cars of all times.

VTesla Inc.'s stock ran up 4.3% in premarket trade Friday, with Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker saying the "new age of trucking begins today," after the unveiling of the new Tesla Semi truck. Late Thursday, Tesla unveiled its new semi-autonomous electric-powered big rig, with a 500-mile range per charge, on tap for production in 2019. "The Tesla truck appears to best current diesel truck performance in almost every measurable way," Shanker wrote in a note to clients. "Comfort and connectivity will likely be unparalleled as well." He said that while Tesla didn't announce any launch partners as expected, product development head Jerome Guillen briefly thanked customers for many orders. Earlier Friday, J.B. Hunt Transportation Inc. said it has made reservations to buy "multiple" Semi trucks. Tesla's stock had fallen 11.2% over the past three months through Thursday, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average has gained 4.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7.9%.

VRating agency Moody's said on Friday it has withdrawn its credit rating on Reliance Communications, as it considers the Indian telecom operator to be in default for missing an interest payment on its bonds that was due last week. Debt-laden Reliance Communications posted a fourth straight quarterly loss last week and said it had failed to pay interest on some debentures, sending its shares tumbling. "Moody's has withdrawn the ratings as a missed scheduled payment of either interest or principal is considered a default under Moody's definitions," the rating agency said in a note. With net of debt of 443 billion rupees as of end-March, RCom - as the company is widely known - is the most leveraged listed Indian telecom company, and along with its rivals has been hit badly by a price war with upstart rival Reliance Jio, which is controlled by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. RCom, controlled by Ambani's younger brother, Anil, is attempting to convert roughly 70 billion rupees of its debt to equity via a strategic debt restructuring plan. As part of the plan, the company is under a debt standstill and hence there are no payments of interest or principal being made to RCom lenders or bondholders, said Moody's, adding it was thus withdrawing its 'Ca' corporate family rating on the company and its 'Ca' rating on RCom's senior secured notes. Earlier in November, RCom signed a deal to sell its non-core direct-to-home business, in a bid to reduce its debt load. (Reporting by Rahul Bhatia; Editing by Euan Rocha).

The man in question, 19, then told officers he had a snake in his pants and pulled out a 14-inch (36cm) royal python. (Picture: Getty). The man in question, 19, then told officers he had a snake in his pants and pulled out a 14-inch (36cm) royal python. He was taken to a police cell to sober up and the snake was put in a box. Officers said they are now looking for the reptile\u2019s owner and are examining whether the man may have violated animal welfare laws. According to a police report, the snake may belong to one of the 19-year-old\u2019s family members.

VA builder works on the roof of a home under construction in Jackson Township, Pa. (Keith Srakocic / Associated Press). Construction of new homes in the United States climbed 13.7% in October, the biggest jump in a year, as builders broke ground on more apartments and single-family houses. But the increase wasn't spread nationwide: Construction declined in the West. The Commerce Department said Friday that the monthly gain put U.S. housing starts at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That is the best pace for home construction in 12 months. Housing starts have risen just 2.4% year-to-date, largely because fewer apartment complexes are being built. Construction of single-family houses has driven much of the growth this year, a sign of greater demand from buyers in a healthy job market. But recent building trends reversed somewhat in October, with most of the momentum coming from apartment construction. The building of multi-family properties jumped 37.4% in October. Construction of single-family houses increased 5.3%. Still, the building of new homes has done little to alleviate the growing shortage of existing homes for sale. This shortage has started to stifle the broader real estate market. Purchases of existing homes have fallen over the past 12 months, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. The decline largely reflects that there are 121,600 fewer homes on the market during the same period, a 6.4% decrease that new construction has been unable to offset. "For a significant increase in new homes, municipalities are going to have to work harder to make more land available for building," said Robert Frick, a corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Construction in the South rose 17.2% last month compared with the month before, a sign the region is regaining its footing after damage from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Home construction shot up 42.2% in the Northeast thanks to groundbreakings for apartments. Construction increased 18.4% in the Midwest, but it declined 3.7% in the West. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 5.9% in October to 1.3 million.

VNEWS | 18/11/2017 | Alberto Navarro.  The Whites travel to an Atlético side who are unbeaten at home so far this term in LaLiga (8:45pm CET).  . Real Madrid return to action following the final international break of the calendar year with a fixture that is sure to be earmarked in the diaries of football fans the world over: the first Madrid derby of the campaign (8:45pm CET). Indeed, on this occasion it's also a historic encounter, with this being the sides' first-ever meeting at the Wanda Metropolitano.  With the two teams level on points in the LaLiga standings, the Whites will be aiming to put some ground between themselves and tonight's opponents. One look at the statistics confirms Real Madrid's excellent form on their travels, with the team having found the net in each of their last 35 away games. Speaking in the build-up, Zinedine Zidane insisted that "We come into the game in good shape and we'll have to play at full throttle for the full 90 minutes in the derby\u201d. The defending LaLiga champions face an Atlético Madrid side who are unbeaten so far this term at the Wanda Metropolitano. Four teams have visited Atlético's new home and none of them have managed to emerge victorious : Málaga (1-0), Sevilla (2-0), Barcelona (1-1) and Villarreal (1-1).  Defensive solidity .  Atlético have been breached on just two occasions at home and, ahead of this round of fixtures, can lay claim to having the division's joint-meanest defence, along with Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla and Leganés. Ángel Correa, with four goals to his name, currently tops the Rojiblancos' scoring charts. .

VA Wisconsin milling company should pay $1.8 million in fines for failing to prevent a fatal plant explosion earlier this year, federal labor officials announced Friday.  The Didion Milling Co. corn processing plant in Cambria exploded on May 31, killing five workers and injuring 12 more, including an employee who had to have both legs amputated after the blast sent a railroad car crashing down on him.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a news release Friday saying that an accumulation of highly combustible grain dust probably caused the explosion.  The agency said the explosion was preventable and issued 19 citations against the company for violations including failing to maintain equipment, failing to implement a program to control dust accumulations, failing to shut down ignition sources, failing to prevent static electricity discharges, failing to provide adequate protective equipment to workers and failing to correct malfunctioning dust collection systems. OSHA officials proposed fining the company $1.84 million.  "Didion Milling could have prevented this tragedy if it had addressed hazards that are well-known in this industry," said OSHA Regional Administrator Ken Nishiyama Atha. "Instead, their disregard for the law led to an explosion that claimed the lives of workers, and heartbreak for their families and the community.".  The company has 15 business days from receiving the citations to comply with the fine, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The commission is an independent federal agency that decides disputes over OSHA citations and penalties.  Didion officials said in a statement Friday afternoon that they disagree with the severity of the penalties and OSHA's conclusions. They said they're working with their attorneys to decide how to proceed.  They added they plan to build a new plant with state-of-the-art safety equipment.

VKeanu Reeves has survived a lot of crazy stuff. World-dominating machines. Bomb-laden bus rides. Traveling through time in a phone booth. But his biggest challenge of all: impressing bikers. This week, Reeves has abandoned Hollywood for Milan. The Italian city plays host to the Esposizione Internazionale Ciclo Motociclo e Accessori, or EICMA. He's not at the world's preeminent bike convention to gawk at the wares, however. He's unveiling three new motorcycles he has spent the past years of his life designing and building. \u201cIt\u2019s international, it\u2019s all the journalists and enthusiasts,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s let\u2019s plant our flag. Let\u2019s go to EICMA with three models, and hopefully people will really love what we make.\u201d. By us, he means Arch Motorcycle, the shop he founded with his business partner and friend Gard Hollinger. They teamed up in 2007, when Reeves, a two-wheel enthusiast, asked Hollinger, a well-known bike designer, to make him a custom ride. He was so impressed with the final product, he convinced Hollinger to start building and selling a version of the bike to rich but discerning riders. The KRGT-1 is designed, bespoke, for each customer in Arch\u2019s workshop just south of LA, for a price of around $78,000 and up. For years, creating variations on that one model kept Reeves and Hollinger creatively content, and Arch hummed along. Now, the young outfit is expanding its scope with three new bikes. One is an updated version of the original KRGT-1 for 2018, with tweaked looks, upgraded suspension, better brakes, and EURO 4 emissions compliance, so it can be sold on the other side of the pond. The Arch 1s is a single-sided swing arm that offers a sportier, more aggressive ride than the average cruiser. Rounding out the trio is the "ultra-exclusive" Arch Method 143. Reeves and Hollinger will only make 23 of these \u201cconcept production\u201d bikes. You can get a closeup look inside Arch's Southern California shop in the video above. Reeves and Hollinger won't announce pricing for the new models until next year, but don't expect to spend less than what you'd drop on a new BMW 5-Series. You can, however, expect to attract a lot more attention, and to have a way more excellent adventure.

VTesla's new Semi trucks are slated to boast a range of up to 500 miles per charge \u2014 but powering up those batteries will still be important to the truckers who have to drive long routes. . The automaker will introduce an entirely new kind of charging station for its new big rigs: Megachargers. The units will be even more powerful than the Supercharger network Tesla already offers for its cars. . Like the Supercharger network, the Megachargers will be built around the world to support the fleet, as Musk claimed truckers will be able to "travel anywhere in the world via the Megachargers.". The new Megachargers will be solar-powered, so charging with them won't take any juice away from the rest of the grid. Musk claims that truckers will be able to charge at their origin or their final destination while they unload their freight, or take a 30-minute break from the road, leave their rig on a Megacharger, and have enough power to drive up to 400 miles. . It's not clear where or when we can expect to see these new stations popping up or how much it will cost to use them, but Musk said the first Semi's will being production in 2019. Those trucks will hit the road soon after \u2014 so they'll need to have the new Megachargers ready to keep them up and running. .

VMassimiliano Allegri © Gallo Images. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri distanced himself from taking up the vacant post as Italy coach on Saturday, but left the door open to eventually accepting the job.  Italy are still reeling from their historic failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup finals after Sweden beat them in the play-offs on Monday. .  Heartbroken Italians are looking for some immediate positive response, and Allegri, who won the Italian title in 2011 at AC Milan and the last three at Juventus, would fit the bill. .  "Coaching the national team is one of my ambitions, but not right now," the 50-year-old told a press conference ahead of Juventus's game at Sampdoria Sunday. .  "In a few years," said the man who made his name as coach at Cagliari and who is known as tactically astute.  "I still have major objectives to attain with Juventus, building a team for the future.".  "As for the national team we can talk about that in a few years time, if indeed I ever get offered the job," said Allegri, who took over Juventus in 2014.  Italy is still floundering in disbelief after 75 000 stunned fans in Milan's San Siro Stadium and 14.8 million horrified Italians watched their national fall from grace at the hands of Sweden on Monday. .  Italy had only failed once before to make the cut, at the Sweden finals of 1958.  The Italian football federation called crisis talks on Wednesday and sacked the 69-year-old Gian Piero Ventura. .  With his avuncular touch the former Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, AC Milan, Chelsea, PSG and Juventus coach Carlo Ancelotti is the favourite to take over and rebuild the Azzurri.

VBOURNEMOUTH, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 28: Michy Batshuayi of Chelsea during the Premier League match between AFC Bournemouth and Chelsea at Vitality Stadium on October 28, 2017 in Bournemouth, England. (Photo by Michael Steele/Getty Images). During his press conference, Antonio Conte provided a few injury updates ahead of Chelsea\u2019s Premier League clash with West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday with a difficult away assignment. The Blues will travel to the Hawthorns to take on West Brom. Despite their early season struggles, any Tony Pulis team represents a tough afternoon. Speaking ahead of the game, Antonio Conte provided updates on several injured Chelsea players. Batshuayi has a problem in his ankle. Musonda has a problem in his knee. Moses is progressing well and I hope to see him back next week. Gary Cahill is in contention for tomorrow\u2019s game, he is fit. \u2013 via chelseafc.com. Michy Batshuayi\u2019s injury is fresh news. The Belgian was on the bench for the Manchester United game and was called up to the Belgium squad. However, he then left the camp due to this ankle problem and will not be available for the Midlands trip. Victor Moses, meanwhile, is a player that many fans desperately want to see back in a Chelsea shirt. The Nigerian has been missing since mid-October and despite the Blues enjoying a fairly decent run of results, his return will be welcomed, albeit only next week. After his striking omission from the matchday squad to face United, David Luiz is expected to return to the fold on Saturday. He may even slot straight back into the starting eleven due to Gary Cahill\u2019s minor niggle. The Englishman has been passed fit, but it will be interesting to see which defender Conte picks. Elsewhere, Charly Musonda is unavailable but that will make little difference. The youngster was realistically never going to start this game and his absence only opens up a spot on the bench. Importantly, Chelsea\u2019s key players are all fit. The Blues need to hit the ground running after the break and put together a serious winning streak to keep up with Manchester City. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team do not look like slipping up and thus the pressure is on the chasing pack. What team do you think Conte will select? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!.

VMartin Keown believes Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino should use Eric Dier in a centre-half role. John Stones, Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson. Martin Keown believes Eric Dier\u2019s best position is on the right side of a three-man defence ahead of Totteham Hotspur\u2019s trip to Arsenal. The England international has established himself as one of the best defensive players in the Premier League over the past 24 months or so. Dier started his Tottenham career at full-back before he was utilised in a holding midfield role under current Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino. The retired Argentina international has also used Dier in defence when Toby Alderweireld or Jan Vertonghen have been sidelined with injury. England boss Gareth Southgate has also played Dier in a variety of positions since taking over the reigns of the national team back in 2016. Dier will be hoping to start Tottenham\u2019s game against bitter rivals Arsenal in the north London derby in Saturday\u2019s early kick-off. Former Arsenal defender Keown suggested that Dier\u2019s best position is at centre-half and ideally on the right side of a back three. \u201cDier is such an outstanding player that he can play in midfield,\u201d Keown told the Daily Mail. . \u201cUltimately, if England had better midfield players he would be in the back line. \u201cFor me, Dier is England\u2019s best central defender. I read this morning that Gareth Southgate intends to play him as a defender at the World Cup. \u201cWhile that is the right move, he needs to play on the right of a back three rather than in the middle.\u201d. Tottenham signed Dier in a £4m transfer from Sporting Lisbon in the 2014 summer transfer window. Spurs finished in second place in the Premier League table but ended up seven points adrift of eventual champions Chelsea. Tottenham are eight points behind leaders Manchester City.

VQualcomm believes the shareholders\u2019 best interest lies in the hands of current management. Last Monday, Broadcom made what would be the largest-ever tech acquisition offer to San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm. This morning, Qualcomm announced a unanimously approved decision to reject the offer, saying the $130 billion (including $25 billion of debt) proposal \u201csignificantly undervalues\u201d the company. \u201cThe Board has concluded that Broadcom\u2019s proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty,\u201d Tom Horton, Qualcomm\u2019s presiding director, said in a statement. Qualcomm believes the shareholders\u2019 best interest lies in the hands of current management. \u201cNo company is better positioned in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking within the semiconductor industry. We are confident in our ability to create significant additional value for our stockholders as we continue our growth in these attractive segments,\u201d CEO Steve Mollenkopf said. \u201cThe fact that the offer was rejected is not surprising,\u201d Bloomberg reporter Ed Hammond told Bloomberg TV this morning. Hammond said the relationship between the two semiconductor companies has never been good, as both have tried to expand their monopolies over the chip market through acquisitions. Qualcomm is in the process of acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV, a NASDAQ-listed chip maker specializing in automotive technology, in a deal valued at $47 billion to diversify away from its core mobile business. Broadcom offered to buy Qualcomm at $70 per share. That was 28 percent higher than Qualcomm\u2019s trading price when the offer was made public, and 33 percent higher than Qualcomm\u2019s 30-day average price. Qualcomm\u2019s share price has stayed relatively stable since the offer announcement, up by 5 percent in the past week.

VTNN Online. The National Vice Chairman (South-South) of the All Progressives Congress, Hilliard Eta, has said that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is no longer an option for the 2019 presidential race. Eta said this in an interview in Abuja, on Friday. He explained that he was one of those who canvassed votes for Atiku during the APC presidential primaries in 2015 but that their loyalty shifted to Muhammadu Buhari after he became the party\u2019s presidential candidate. Eta explained that he and all the other party faithful cast their lot with the party and its candidate which eventually led to Buhari\u2019s emergence as President. According to him, even the ardent critics of Buhari have been surprised by his performance. Eta said the President was already doing what Atiku had always aspired to do if given the chance. The APC chieftain said, \u201cAnother cycle is about to come and Atiku is no more an option for me because I think that the option for me now is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Buhari, who has done remarkably well in keeping the promises that he made to Nigerians.\u201d. He urged the former Vice President to join the President in building the Nigeria of his dreams. When asked if he was pushing for an automatic ticket for Buhari, Eta said, \u201cWell, because of the sterling qualities of the President, because of the job he has done, the totality of the membership of the party may want him to go back without contest. \u201cWhat I mean is that those who may want to contest against him may join hands with him to build the country and have him only as both the aspirant and eventually the candidate of the party. It has happened in a lot of political circumstances around the world.\u201d. In response to Eta, the Media Adviser to the former Vice President, Paul Ibe, said every Nigerian was entitled to their opinion. He explained that the party chieftain was expressing a personal opinion, but that he could only speak for himself in such matters. Ibe, who spoke in a telephone interview, said, \u201cHe is entitled to his opinion like all Nigerians, he is free to speak for himself just like he has done, but he can\u2019t speak for all Nigerians.\u201d.

VGiovani Santillan finally has a taste out of what it is like to be a legit contender. He still has a ways to go before he becomes an elite fighter, but he is on the right path and the right people behind him. Santillan stopped Dodzi Kemeh at the Doubletree Hotel in Ontario, California. The 10 round bout headlined a seven-bout card that can be seen in its entirety on ThompsonBoxing.com or Thompson Boxing\u2019s Facebook page. Santillan staggered Kemeh at the end of round two. At the conclusion of the fourth, the ringside doctor stopped the fight after feeling that Kemeh's left eye was too injured to allow the boxer to continue. Santillan (23-0, 13 knockouts) was considered the B-side in his last fight on July 7 against welterweight contender Sammy Valentin. In the clash between unbeaten welterweights, Santillan dropped and eventually stopped Valetin in the second round. The win earned Santillan a regional title belt and a number seven ranking by the WBO. The 25-year-old from San Diego wants to prove he belongs amongst the best in the division, but also wants to get better with every outing. \u201cAs of now, Valentin is the most skilled fighter that I\u2019ve fought,\u201d said Santillan, who is promoted by Thompson Boxing, the company that has promoted the likes of Timothy Bradley, Josesito Lopez, Mauricio Herrera, Yonnhy Perez, and current WBA junior featherweight titleholder Danny Roman. \u201cI didn\u2019t let (Valentin) shine or show anything. I tagged him pretty good in the first round so I knew I was going to stop him.\u201d. Kemeh (19-2, 17 KOs) was making his U.S. debut after having fought his entire career in his native. Only two of his victories have come over those with winning records. The impressive victory over Kemeh could put Santillan in a position where he could fight on a televised card or in an elimination bout. Santillan does not take these opportunities for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s a big responsibility to be ranked where I am. All future performances need to be memorable. I don\u2019t have to get knockout win every time, but I do need to make sure to show all me skills. It\u2019s a long process to get ranked and win titles. I\u2019ve worked too hard to let this opportunity slip away.". In an eight round featherweight bout, Erick Ituarte (19-1-1, 3 KOs) knocked out Gustavo Molina (25-17, 9 KOs) of Mexico in the first round.

VAll about how drivers can get penalised for simple infringements. What exactly are grid penalties: Penalties may be imposed on drivers for numerous offences, including starting prematurely, speeding in the pitlane, causing an accident, blocking unfairly or ignoring safety flags. Broadly, there are four types of penalty which a driver may incur for violation of on-track rules:. 1. The five-second penalty: This is a flexible one where a driver may even serve it the next time he is due to pit. If he doesn\u2019t need to pit, then five seconds will be added to his time at the end of the race. 2. The drive-through penalty: This requires the driver to enter the pit lane, drive through it while obeying its speed limit, and exit without stopping. Drive-through penalties are normally imposed for minor offences such as kerb hopping at chicanes, ignoring yellow flags or cutting corners. As a drive-through penalty does not require a driver to stop and pit, it is less costly to a driver\u2019s race times than a stop-go penalty. 3. The ten-second (also called \u2018stop-go\u2019) penalty requires the driver to enter the pit lane, stop at his pit for ten seconds, and then exit again. As the stop is designed to punish the driver for an offence, team mechanics are forbidden to work on the offending car at any time when the driver is serving the penalty. Stop-go penalties are generally imposed for more serious offences such as jump starts, pit lane speeding, ignoring blue flags or unfair blocking. The ten-second halt makes a stop-go penalty much more costly to a driver\u2019s race time than a drive-through penalty. 4. A more severe penalty may be imposed for more severe infractions, such as adding ten places to the driver\u2019s grid position at the next grand prix. For example, if the driver has qualified in pole position, he will start the race in eleventh place instead.

V Euphoric crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital to demand the departure of President Robert Mugabe after nearly four decades in power. In a colorful gathering that even days ago would have drawn an immediate police crackdown, Zimbabweans giddy with joy raced through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced. Some had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in earlier this week and put Mugabe under house arrest, with the slogan: \u201cGo, go, our general!!!\u201d Marchers handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved. \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas,\u201d said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time. The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, is said to be asking for more time amid negotiations with regional leaders that seek his exit with a veneer of dignity. But he is virtually powerless and deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested, and the crowds in Harare on Saturday were making it clear the country was impatient to move on without him. Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingered in power \u2013 or if Mugabe\u2019s longtime but recently fired deputy led a new government \u2013 people reveled in the rare chance to speak out.

VHer celebration may already be underway. Serena Williams is about to get married! Earlier, news broke that the star is tying the knot this week. It was also revealed that the athlete and her spouse-to-be, Alexis Ohanian, are saying their vows in New Orleans, Louisiana. We already know about the star-studded guest list, but now, we're learning about the wedding's theme, and a few other details about the multi-day celebration. According to Entertainment Tonight, the event will be Beauty and the Beast-themed. The celebrity is said to be wearing two different dresses, one of which TMZ saw being delivered yesterday. An E! News source added that the bride's sisters will be her bridesmaids. The Entertainment Tonight insider also shared that the rehearsal dinner took place last night at the restaurant Meril. According to E! News, about 100 of the couple's family and friends were there, including spouses Eva Longoria and José Bastón, and newlyweds Colton Haynes and Jeff Leatham. Don't count on many photos\u2014upon arrival, guests were apparently asked to put their phones into lockable pouches. Everyone munched on beignets from a Café Du Monde truck, and plenty of Champagne bottles were popped. Williams wore a glamorous, sparkling outfit for the occassion. . With the rehearsal dinner happening last night, the wedding must be today! Apparently, guests will sip on pre-ceremony drinks, watch the couple wed, and then head to the reception. The party is posed to go until 3 a.m. Tomorrow, there's said to be a post-wedding brunch. That will take place at the Ace Hotel, and will have a DJ, games, and drinks\u2014how fun!. We've also learned that Ohanian had his bachelorette party on Tuesday night. That celebration was held at Frankie & Johnny's. "It was a good-size group and they enjoyed themselves," a source explained to E! News. The insider said that Ohanian and his friends "wanted to have an authentic New Orleans experience.".

VAfter making a huge impression as a pop artiste in 2013, we all witnessed Cynthia Morgan\u2018s smooth transition into the dancehall space \u2013 a more convenient environment for any female artiste to exist in as there is little or no competition in that territory. . For over three years, Cynthia Morgan stood out and reigned supreme as the Queen of Nigerian Dancehall music dishing out par reggae tunes that kept us in touch with memories of the movie Third World Cop. Her patois always effortlessly came correct on each record thus leading us to question the originality of her male counterparts. From 2015, Cynthia Morgan began to slowly sleep on us after her break up and makeup charade with Burna Boy on the visual representation of her Simatiniya single. Just like her preceding records, Simatiniya was a good song but we just never got a follow up (well we got a few leaks and singles which were barely promoted) \u2013 leaving us to whirl in our imaginations of what could be possibly wrong with the star girl. Some suggested that the Headies Next Rated award loss was what took a toll on her while others insisted she was either going through a personal storm or having managerial hiccups. . News reaching us confirms that her supposed hiatus from the music scene is indeed a result of managerial hiccups. A member of her team who spoke to NET revealed that the singer has parted ways with the Jude Okoye led North Side INC Label which she joined in 2013. The source also disclosed that Morgan has now signed on to a new management which will be announced in due time. It is unclear is Jude Okoye\u2019s own crisis in the dissolution of Psquare could have contributed to his lukewarm approach to managing Cynthia Morgan. On why she hasn\u2019t been putting out music, our source explained that the managerial transition played a role in the break, but assured that everything is now in order and the singer will be releasing her first single under the new management in the nearest future (January 2018 possibly). \u2018We are not granting interviews for now but we will send out a press release to address and inform the public very soon\u2019, He added. Reggae music isn\u2019t a dominant genre in Nigeria and Cynthia Morgan\u2019s recent inactivity has left the Dancehall throne vacant. We hope to have her back at full throttle. .

VYou Were Never Really Here, 2017. Directed by Lynne Ramsay.  Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Ekaterina Samsanov, Alessandro Nivola, and Judith Roberts. SYNOPSIS:. When a teenage girl (Ekaterina Samsanov) goes missing, a fixer (Joaquin Phoenix) with a unique skillset is sent to hammer out some justice on those responsible. It takes a very special film to leave you stunned in your seat whilst the credits roll, collecting your thoughts in the dark, not quite ready to bleed into the reality of the outside world. Lynne Ramsay achieved it with the emotional wallop of We Need to Talk About Kevin, and now she has done it again, in a slightly more perplexing manner with You Were Never Really Here. It\u2019s a film in the form of a slight burst of existential violence, with a man on fire central performance from the bearded shuffling monolith of Joaquin Phoenix. With a plot that\u2019s relatively simple, and a ninety minute runtime with which to exacerbate the gut-punch nature of the film, You Were Never Really Here\u2019s complexities can be found on the hunched shoulders of Phoenix. Economic with words, he is a quiet spectre who offers up insight with his actions. Whether that\u2019s the way he dotes on his mother (Judith Roberts), who watches Psycho in a not so subtle nod to their relationship, or how he regularly self-asphyxiates with a plastic bag as a way to feel alive in a world of dim lighting and decay. It\u2019s a performance that challenges the audience, provoking fear, sympathy, and condemnation in equal measure. Matching the subtleties of Phoenix is the film\u2019s composition, with Ramsay underplaying almost every aspect of it. The main vengeance sequence largely plays out through CCTV imagery, allowing you to feel the full effect of Phoenix\u2019s Joe ghosting around the frame to take down the \u2018bad guys\u2019. In fact most of the violence takes place off-screen, we just see the bloodied weapons or battle scars, the searing pain of which is palpable. In such moments you\u2019re truly gripped, never quite sure where this overwhelmingly bleak journey is taking you, which is why some might be left frustrated by the beautifully ambiguous resolution. It\u2019s holding up a mirror to world of uncertainty, refusing to offer the viewer or Phoenix the promise of salvation. Deal with it. You Were Never Really Here is the cinematic equivalent of a bruise; it hurts, bloodies, and leaves a mark that will last for days.

VSmartwatches for kids have been banned by regulators in Germany, with parents even urged to destroy the wearable devices. This is not the first time that electronic devices involving children have faced the banhammer, but why would the German government also recommend the smartwatches to be destroyed?. Smartwatches For Kids Banned In Germany. The Federal Network Agency, the telecommunications regulator of Germany, banned the sale of smartwatches for children, and urged parents who have already bought the devices to destroy them. According to the agency, a number of the wearable devices may allow someone to remotely access their microphones. This would effectively allow people to spy on children wearing the smartwatches, including the people around them. Recording conversations without permission from all people involved is illegal in Germany. Federal Network Agency President Jochen Homann revealed that in the regulator's investigation, parents were actually using the smartwatches to listen to what teachers say during classes. Turning the smartwatches into spying devices that function similarly to baby monitors can be done by hackers and parents alike. This is why the German government is very serious in wishing for the devices to be destroyed. In fact, it is requesting for parents to document how the smartwatches are disposed of, with the regulator to then issue a so-called "certificate of destruction.". Kids And Digital Privacy. The ban on smartwatches for kids follows the warning issued last month by the European Consumer Organization that the devices may be serious threats to the privacy of children. A Norwegian Consumer Council report then revealed flaws in several smartwatches that made them vulnerable to hackers. It is unclear if the findings and decision of the Federal Network Agency were based on these previous reports, but the smartwatch ban for kids is not the first time that the country's government has ordered parents to destroy something that belonged to their children. Earlier this year, the Federal Network Agency warned parents that My Friend Cayla, a Wi-Fi-connected smart doll, can be compromised to allow hackers to listen to children and even talk to them. This was possible through the insecure Bluetooth connection in the toy, so as it was taken down from shelves, parents were also recommended to destroy the doll if they bought it. Fortunately, some companies such as Google, through its Family Link app, have become more vigilant in protecting the digital privacy of children. However, the tables have turned in some cases, such as how a 10-year-old kid was able to unlock his mother's iPhone X through Face ID.

Blavity reports, this week the site made it even easier to find black-owned businesses near you through a new app. Also called Black Wall Street, the iOS and Android app helps you find black-owned businesses near you. Each entry offers directions to the business, images of what you can buy there, and reviews from others that have been there previously. You can set up alerts to get a notification when you pass by a black-owned store so you can make a point to pop in (or visit later on), and get special offers that you can redeem while shopping. Image: Official Black Wall Street. The app really shines for brick-and-mortar stores, but listings also include online shopping opportunities. Black entrepreneurs can also create listings for their businesses within the app, and a two-way messaging feature allows customers to potentially interact directly with business owners.

VInappropriate images were found on Green's Commons computer in 2008. Damian Green arrives at Downing Street in London. Extreme pornography found on the Commons computer of First Minister of State Damian Green was made illegal just a few weeks after it was discovered by police in raid on Green's office in November 2008. Laws regarding the possession of violent, hardcore porn were changed on 26 January, 2009, eight weeks after the raid. The Sun reports that some of the images found were so extreme the police sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) about whether to press charges. There were no grounds for prosecution given the raid took place before the law was changed. It's not clear who was responsible for downloading the material. A source told the tabloid: "Porn was being accessed on an almost virtual daily basis. Police were told nothing could be done. "Quite simply, it was not illegal to be in possession of extreme images before January 2009. If the raid had happened a few weeks later it would have been.". The raid was conducted as part of an investigation into government leaks. Green insists he was not the one who downloaded the images, and doubled down on this in a statement sent to The Sun: "As I have said throughout I did not put or view pornography on the computers taken from my office.". The change in the law was made after a four-year campaign led by the parents of 32-year-old Jane Longhurst, who was murdered by a man who was found in possession of violent images of simulated murder and rape. In January 2009, it became illegal to access porn that featured life-threatening acts (simulated or not), depicted sex with animals or corpses, or involved injury to a person's genitalia. Green, who was shadow immigration minister at the time of the raid, has been under pressure to resign since the story was reported last week, and is now the subject of a Whitehall investigation into his conduct. The investigation was ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May after Green was accused of sexual misconduct by journalist Kate Maltby, an accusation he has called "untrue and deeply hurtful".

VGreater Manchester Police dog Tyson. Good boy. A Greater Manchester Police dog named Tyson has been showered with treats (we hope) after tracking down three suspected armed bank robbers who allegedly stole a box of cash after striking a security worker with a crowbar. Tyson tracked three men down in a woodland area where the offenders drove after escaping the crime scene in a car. Tyson found them in dense undergrowth, according to Manchester Evening News. A 28-year-old man and 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. Sergeant Danny Kabal of Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit said: "This was a shocking incident where a security employee was violently attacked by three, brutal, offenders. "Thankfully, our specialist team, including Tyson the police dog, responded immediately and as a result, we have been able to make two arrests. The three robbers targeted a security worker carrying a box of cash at 4pm on Friday (17 November) at a bank on Stockport Road in Levenshulme. They demanded the worker hand over the box, then struck them, causing them to drop the box which they grabbed and escaped with. "Tyson's swift work shows how vital police dogs are in our fight against violent criminality. While we've made two arrests, our investigation continues and I'd ask anyone who has information that could help with our enquiries, to get in touch with us.". What a good boy.

VInvestors in the Nigerian capital market will soon be able to use their Bank Verification Number (BVN) as a means of identification as capital market regulators seek to widen the scope of customer verification. A circular obtained by The Nation at the weekend indicated that Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the apex capital market regulator, has started the process of amending capital market\u2019s rules to pave way for the admission of BVN as part of acceptable means of identification in the capital market. The draft of the \u201cproposed inclusion of BVN as a valid means of identification of individual clients in the capital market\u201d stipulates that a capital market operator shall use a combination of electronic and documentary checks to confirm different sources of the same information provided by the clients. \u201cThe capital market operator may use the Bank Verification Number (BVN) as a means of verifying information provided by the clients,\u201d the rule stated. SEC noted that the adoption of BVN was premised on the fact that BVN gives a unique identity that can be verified across the Nigerian banking industry and it is not peculiar to one bank alone. According to SEC, the BVN is a nationally acceptable means of identification implemented by all banks in Nigeria as directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The Commission stated that the adoption of BVN would help to address issues of identity theft and reduce exposure to fraud while simultaneously promoting financial inclusion of unbanked clients. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is currently investigating not less than 10 cases of investors\u2019 impersonation. About 20 persons are being investigated by the anti-corruption agency for alleged impersonation and fraudulent attempt to convert investors\u2019 shares into their names. Many of the impersonators were operating as syndicates with links across the chain of the capital market transaction. Some of the impersonators had successfully converted and sold other people\u2019s shares but were apprehended when the original owners of the shares reported the illegal transactions. Although the details of the investigations are still sketchy because of the confidentiality of the investigations, a source in the know of the investigations confirmed that there were syndicates that took advantage of the dormancy of some investors\u2019 account to surreptitiously prey on such accounts. The source said some of the impersonators specialised in fraudulent conversion of shareholding estates. Capital market regulators have responded to recent cases of capital market frauds by tightening existing disclosure rules and sanctions as well as increased collaboration with the law enforcement agencies.

VBe responsible without anyone knowing. That audiophile in your life can be so difficult to shop for, especially if you're one of those low-maintenance listeners who's never really understood the appeal of, say, collecting fragile vinyl records. (In your defense, Spotify's library of tunes is extremely large and extremely free.). Well, fret not: The Mashable Shop is currently holding a sale on the EarDials, a set of smart, transparent earplugs that make the perfect stocking stuffer for any music snob who still wants to be able to be able to hear after the encore wraps up. (Imagine that!). People who wear earplugs to a show may find themselves the butt of a couple jokes now and then, but tinnitus \u2014 the ringing in your ears after a loud concert \u2014 is no joke. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders notes that "long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss." Considering most clubs and concerts expose you to levels of sound over 100 decibels, it's reasonable to assume that just one show can permanently damage your hearing if you're not careful. That's where the EarDials come in: Specifically designed for piercing music environments, these comfortable, low-profile hearing protection filters sound so you can still enjoy your favorite artists and chat with your fellow concert-goers without suffering the consequences of loud noise exposure (or looking like a dweeb). Each pair comes with access to a companion mobile app that detects the safety of the sound level around you, as well as a compact aluminum storage case that can fit right in your purse or pocket. With the purchase of a pair of EarDials, you'll not only be benefitting you (or your Secret Santa's) ears, but someone else's, as 5% of all profits go to charities seeking a cure for tinnitus and noise-induced hearing loss. ('Tis the season of giving, after all.).  to pick up a pair of EarDials for just $21.99 \u2014 33% off the original price of $33.

VThe Incredibles are back, and they have a laser baby. This is great news. Disney Pixar's first-ever look at The Incredibles 2 reveals that the youngest member of the superhuman family has some new powers: Jack-Jack Parr can now shoot lasers out of his eyes. That's in addition to the shapeshifting, fire-making, and phasing powers he tapped into in the first movie. The #Incredibles2 trailer is here. See the film in theatres in 3D June 15, 2018. pic.twitter.com/episnabztB. \u2014 Disney\u2022Pixar (@DisneyPixar) November 18, 2017. While our first look at The Incredibles 2 focuses dad Bob Parr's adventures in babysitting, we learned over the summer that mom Helen Parr \u2014 aka "Elastigirl" \u2014 is the star of this new story. We don't know what global threat she's facing, but we're sure she can handle it. The trailer here raises more questions than it answers. Jack-Jack already had powers in The Incredibles, he just lacked control. And yet here we see Bob excitedly shout in Jack-Jack's face, "You have powers!" Maybe it's a flashback?. At least now we know when answers will be coming. The long-awaited sequel to Pixar's 2004 will be in theaters next summer, on June 15, 2018. UPDATED Nov. 18 at 11:28 a.m. ET An earlier version of this story erroneously identified Jack-Jack as a new member of The Incredibles family. In fact, Jack-Jack played a major role in the original movie. We regret the error.

Karatina town in Nyeri county was the scene of illegal, forced searches as rowdy youth searched vehicles heading to Kagumo High School for the late Nyeri governor Wahome Gakuru's funeral service. The youth begun searching cars in the convoy as soon as the hearse bearing the deceased's casket passed through town. According to a report by Nairobi News on Saturday, November 18, the illegal search begun after rumour went round that National Super Alliance front runner Raila Odinga would pass through the town on the way to the state funeral.

For two hours, traffic was interefered with as the youth opened doors, searched beneath the vehicles and demanded to know from drivers if Raila was onboard in their cars. The drivers were apparently also asked to identify themselves before they were allowed to proceed on their way. Drivers were forced to undergo illegal searches for Raila Odinga in Karatina town.

V 'Mugabe no longer has regional backing, he must go,' says Botswana leader. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe attends a university graduation ceremony in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 17, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY. Harare \u2013 Botswana's President Ian Khama has told his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe to step down as he no longer has any regional support to cling on to power, says a report. According to New Zimbabwe.com, Khama said that the military intervention in the southern African country has also "presented an opportunity to put Zimbabwe to a path of peace and prosperity". Said Khama: "I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.". Khama's remarks came after Mugabe refused to step down despite mounting calls for him leave office. The leaders of the 93-year-old's ruling Zanu-PF party took to state television in an apparently coordinated push to call for him to go. "The province resolved unanimously to recall the president... from being the president of the party and the government," said Cornelius Mupereri, a spokesperson for the party's Midlands region. Mupereri was one of several branch officials to appear on ZBC's nightly news to read almost identical statements calling on the liberation hero turned autocrat to resign. Mugabe will face street protests on Saturday, organised by the country's by war veterans and supported by long-standing opponents of the president. The dramatic intervention by the regional leaders of Mugabe's party caps a week of unprecedented turmoil in which generals seized power and put the veteran ruler under house arrest.

VCan't quite get your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL to work properly but don't want to talk to a Google customer service rep? You can turn to AI, or to be exact, Assistant. However, if the virtual helper can't resolve your issue, it'll put you in touch with a real person, so there's that. Google Assistant Is Your Pixel 2 Helper. Thanks to a tipster, Android Police found out that Assistant can troubleshoot some problems on the Pixel 2 XL running on the developer preview of Android 8.1 Oreo. Here's how things went down: The fine folks over at the news outlet asked Assistant, "Why is my phone not charging to 100 percent?" The AI then asked permission to run a battery checkup, and after it got the go-ahead, it provided updates and some questions to pinpoint the issue. In the end, when it couldn't determine what's wrong, it said that it can set up a phone call or a chat conversation with a Google support rep, asking which option the user prefers. Android Police picked the former, and from there, it was only a matter of setting up the contact details. That's just one example too. Based on the evidence so far, Assistant can also check your camera and Bluetooth by telling it "troubleshoot camera" and "troubleshoot Bluetooth" respectively. Exclusive Pixel 2 Feature?. As mentioned earlier, it worked on a Pixel 2 XL with the developer preview of Android 8.1 Oreo. Presumably, it'll work on the Pixel 2 running the same Android version as well. The thing is, Android Police couldn't get Assistant to carry out diagnostic checks on a UK version of the Pixel 2 XL running Android 8.0 Oreo. In short, it's more or less a beta feature, but it's unclear if it'll be limited to U.S. users. However, it could be exclusive to the Pixel 2 lineup since the Pixel Phone Help support page does mention this bit: "Optional: Ask your Google Assistant (Pixel 2 only).". Now the takeaway here is that you can rely on Assistant to troubleshoot your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL, but what's really impressive here is that the virtual helper keeps getting noticeably smarter by the day. On the other hand, Pixel 2 XL issues have been growing as the days go by as well, including but not limited to unresponsive edges and poor audio recording quality. Perhaps the virtual assistant can help with those in the near future.

VTHIS is the tragic moment a Brit rider lost control of his bike on a tight corner of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix. The heartbreaking crash proved to be fatal for Daniel Hegarty, 31. He crashed on lap six of the race after hitting the barriers on the outside of the circuit. Dramatic footage has captured the moment the dad-of-two lost control as he came around the corner. He is thrown from his bike and loses his helmet as he crashes into crash barriers. Hegarty, from Nottingham, who was a regular at the Isle of Man TT, died on the way to hospital. SHOCKED: Daniel Hegarty, 31, died on his way to hospital after the horror crash. He had tweeted on Friday: \u201cPositive Q2 jumped from 19th to 15th with much more competitive times. Really thankful to the @TopgunRacing1 team for their hard work. Bike is much easier to ride now.\u201d. Hegarty was taking part in his second Macau Grand Prix after finishing 16th last year. Northern Ireland's Glenn Irwin was announced the winner after the race was stopped, although there were no anthems or champagne on the podium. SHOCKED: Ms Draycott, pictured with the rider said the love of her life has passed away. HORRIFIC: Hegarty lose control and smashed into the barriers.  \u201cThat's road racing and it's tough\u201d .  Race winner . Speaking afterwards, the winner said it \u201cwas not a celebration\u201d. He added: \u201cIt's a very sad end to what has been a successful week. The win is all irrelevant now and I wouldn't have won the race had it gone the distance. "It's a tragic end to the day. That's road racing and it's tough.\u201d. Hegarty's girlfriend Lucy Draycott said she had lost \u201cthe love of my life\u201d. She wrote on Facebook: \u201cIt is with a broken heart to tell you that the love of my life passed away this morning. HALTED: Organisers cancelled the race immediately following the horrific crash. COMEBACK: Hegarty, left, was racing in the final event of the year. \u201cI just need time to take in what has happened and would appreciate if people could just be patient with me and wait for contact.\u201d. Macau has been hosting the street race for cars and motorbikes since 1954. Hegarty is the first rider to die at the event since Portugal's Luis Carreira was killed in qualifying for the 2012 race.

Mila J has shared 5 new songs in celebration of her 35th birthday. 11.18, named after the singer's date of birth, follows the full-length Dopamine, released in April. In February, she released the seven track mixtape MILAULONGTIME. The new collection features clubby R&Bass jams like "Drifting" as well as steamy throwbacks like "Obsessive." . Mila, who has been known to incorporate choreographed dance into her videos, spoke to HNHH about the way the artform influences her music in an interview last year. "Movement is like expressing an emotion," she said. "So [songwriting and dance] definitely correlate. When you\u2019re in a certain mood \u2013 in dance, you\u2019re gonna move different depending on how you feel. I definitely think that they kind of go together.". In August, Mila released "Touch Me," which appeared on the original soundtrack for the 2017 film Til Death Do Us Part. 1. Dirt. 2. Drifting. 3. Obsessive. 4. Low Down Dirty Shame. 5. Switching Sides.

VThe logistics process was fair but there were recorded glitches in the accreditation of voters, a youth-based organisation has found in its preliminary analysis of the ongoing gubernatorial election in Anambra State. The Youth Initiative for Advocacy and Advancement, YIAGA, said the voting materials in most parts of the state arrived early, but some people were allowed to vote without authentication of their fingerprints. . Such occurrences, even though they happened at few polling stations, constitute \u201ca great concern,\u201d for the overall credibility of the process, YIAGA said in a statement by its director, Samson Toldo. The report was distributed Saturday afternoon as part of the election-monitoring activities of about 500 stationery observers and 29 mobile observers deployed by YIAGA across the state\u2019s 21 local government areas. The group said it deployed Parallel Vote Tabulation observation methodology to get make its findings more accurate and efficient. . The PVT is an advanced methodology that employs well established statistical principles and utilises modern information techniques for election observation. Mr. Itodo said YIAGA officials also found that there was an average of four polling officers per polling unit, challenging INEC to display transparency by publishing collection statistics of voter\u2019s cards. \u201cAPC party agents were seen at 90 per cent of polling units, APGA at 98 per cent of the polling units, and PDP at 89 per cent of polling units,\u201d it found. \u201cFor the purposes of transparency, YIAGA urges INEC to publish the data of the collection rate of the Permanent Voter Card, PVC.\u201d. The findings were similar to what PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 reporters covering the election across the state highlighted earlier today. . Our reporters also found that major political parties, including APGA and APC shared money to the electorate, contrary to denials by their leaders that there was no voter inducement. Thirty-seven candidates are running in today\u2019s election, which analysts widely see as a prelude to 2019 general elections.

VARSENAL are guaranteed a top-four finish if they can keep replicating their scintillating performance against Tottenham. . Arsene Wenger's Arsenal defeated Tottenham 2-0. That\u2019s according to Spurs hero Garth Crooks who grudgingly hailed the Gunners' display against his former club. Arsenal secured a convincing 2-0 win over their arch-rivals at the Emirates this afternoon. Shkodran Mustafi bagged the opener with an impressive header from a Mesut Ozil free kick. And Alexis Sanchez grabbed Arsenal\u2019s second after he rifled home from close range. Crooks says Spurs struggled to keep Arsenal at bay throughout the clash. \u201cI don't feel great,\u201d he told the BBC. Tottenham: Team average - 6.42.  \u201cArsene Wenger's Arsenal defeated Tottenham 2-0\u201d . \u201cIf Arsenal play like that they're guaranteed to end up in the top four. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it took Spurs two Arsenal goals to work out what mood they were in. \u201cIf those Tottenham players are as good as we're all told they are they would have anticipated Arsenal's attacking earlier. \u201cSpurs found it difficult to even get to Arsenal's goal. \u201cI\u2019ve never said Tottenham would win the league, but we hope. It's the hope that kills us!\u201d.

VTesla is making a new version of the Roadster sports car, Elon Musk announced Thursday night, and it looks spectacular. After the Tesla CEO spent half an hour onstage extolling the virtues of his new electric 18-wheeler, he stepped away and the lights went out. Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cSabotage\u201d came on the loudspeakers, and then the new Roadster rolled out of the very Semi he had just introduced, ripping around the massive lot where the trucks had been just a moment earlier. Musk promises insane specs from this new sports car. Zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds, quicker than the average Formula 1 car. A quarter mile in 8.9 seconds, in a world where \u201c10-second cars\u201d are coveted. Top speed somewhere north of 250 mph, putting it in the realm of the fastest production cars on the planet, like the Bugatti Chiron and Koenigsegg Agera. And to go with it, four seats (if you\u2019re traveling with two small people), decent cargo room, and 620 miles of range, thanks to a 200-kilowatt hour battery pack, about double what you get in the most capable Model S. Also, it's a convertible. No surprise the base price will be $200,000, and reserving your spot on the list will cost you $50,000. Considering that Bugatti is a seven-figure car, it's a pretty good deal.1. The Tesla CEO has long said he doesn\u2019t want to make the best electric cars around, but the best cars, period. Introducing this new wonderbeast, he took on a bolder tone. \u201cThe point of this is to give the hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.\u201d He also said it\u2019ll make driving a gas car feel like piloting a steam engine with a side of quiche. When you make cars this outrageous, you get to make up your own metaphors, apparently. The original Roadster was Tesla\u2019s first car, the proof of concept it built from 2008 to 2012. It was the young automaker\u2019s way of showing that electric cars could be cool, not just overgrown golf carts. People had long asked Musk when he would revive the model to go with his sedans and SUVs, he says. Now he\u2019s making it happen\u2014come 2020. A customary word of caution: Tesla has a history of over-promising and delivering late, if ever. Musk is struggling just to produce enough (now quaint-seeming) Model 3 sedans, the car that should appeal to the masses and make Tesla more than a niche automaker\u2014and finally make it profitable. A sports car won\u2019t fix its problems\u2014but it might make one hell of a getaway car.

VChinese President, Xi Jinping. China on Saturday announced a pilot programme to help pension schemes meet growing pressure from an ageing society by transferring shares of state-owned firms to social security funds. A document released by the country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, said the programme would begin this year with shares of up to seven SOEs to be transferred. The plan is intended to help make up for shortfalls in the nation\u2019s pension schemes and will be expanded in 2018 to involve more state-owned companies, the document said. An initial 10 percent of equity in the state firms will be transferred to the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF), the state pension fund. In a report on the plan, state-run Xinhua news agency said China has more than 200 million people over the age of 60, adding that the country \u201cfaces a severe challenge in meeting its pension obligations.\u201d. The problem has become particularly acute in certain regions like the northeastern China industrial belt, home to many elderly former workers at now struggling state-owned companies. China earlier this year began allowing pension funds to invest in stocks and other assets to help expand their returns. The State Council said the plan would help foster a more sustainable pension system and promote reform of state-owned companies. \u201cOver the course of economic development and the ageing of the population, the pressure on basic pension payments has continuously increased,\u201d it said.

VCardiac arrest \u2014 when your heart suddenly stops pumping \u2014 is a killer in the U.S., but at least it probably won't happen during sex. . Scientists at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute analyzed over 4,500 sudden cardiac events that took place between 2002 and 2015 in Portland, Oregon, as part of the long-term Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study. Their results, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, show that less than one percent of these cardiac arrest cases, 34 in total, were related to sex, occurring either during sex or within an hour afterwards. As one might expect, these sexually-triggered heart incidents occurred mostly in men with an average age of 60 who had known heart problems, although one patient was 34. Only two of the cardiac arrest victims were women. This should temper some of the concerns people with heart disease might have about this heart-pumping cardiovascular activity. . "People will ask their doctors if sex increases their risk of sudden death, and we\u2019ve never had the answer before because there never was a study,\u201d said Sumeet Chugh, the study\u2019s lead author and associate director of the Heart Institute for Genomic Cardiology at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. . \u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve had a fair bit of data on physical activity and how it\u2019s related to sudden cardiac arrest, but no one had looked specifically at sexual activity. The risk is very small.\u201d . For heart patients, the question of having sex "needed to be answered," Michael J. Ackerman, a genomics and cardiovascular researcher at the Mayo Clinic who was not involved in the study, told CNN. . "I think it's important to healthy relationships to have this anxiety lifted," Ackerman said. Although the risk for for heart-stopping sex is small, cardiac arrest still unexpectedly kills around 300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Cardiac arrest is different than a heart attack, which is an even greater threat, killing 735,000 Americans every year. During cardiac arrest, the heart stops when the organ's electrical system malfunctions. These are often caused by heart arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation \u2014 so common that you've probably seen defibrilliators (AEDs) at work or in public places. Defibrilliators are intended to shock a malfunctioning heart back to its normal pumping function. Heart attacks, however, happen when something like a glob of accumulated fat blocks the blood flow to someone's heart, depriving the heart of blood and causing part of the heart muscle to die.

VLast week, we learned that a universal red liquid lipstick is coming from Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. And we finally have all of the juicy details about Stunna Lip Paint. . Here's what we know: this is the first liquid lipstick Rihanna has launched under her standout Sephora line. Like Gloss Bomb \u2014 a peach-pink shade that really does look rad on just about everyone \u2014 Stunna Lip Paint is meant to flatter most skin tones. Inclusivity is the same of Fenty's game. The cherry color is what the industry calls a "true red," meaning it is not too cool or too warm. "The perfect red is hard to get right, and it's really hard to find YOUR red that works on your skin tone," Rihanna said in a press release. Damn straight, and if it's as gorgeous \u2014 or rather, stunning, in this case \u2014 as Gloss Bomb, we need it in our makeup bags. You probably do, too. (But you knew that already.). The formula is described by the brand as a soft, matte pigment with 12-hour weightless stay. "I wanted a lipstick that wouldn't budge \u2014 even as you eat, even as you make out," Rihanna said. It was also noted that the bottle needs to be activated before being used. So shake it, and then swipe on the intensely pigmented red. The doe-foot application looks cushion-y and comfy, and the rose gold top begs to be Instagrammed. You probably won't want to throw out the chic, graffiti-printed packaging. . Stunna Lip Paint ($24) launches on Nov. 23 at midnight ET \u2014 so plan your Thanksgiving travel logistics accordingly \u2014 at Sephora.com and FentyBeauty.com. It will be in Sephora stores on Nov. 23. Add it to your Google calendar NOW!.

VIt might sound strange to say that being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes has made me healthier, but I really believe it has. It\u2019s forced me to take my health seriously: to put good health front and centre in my daily life. Before I was diagnosed, I knew what I should be doing, but life is full of \u2018shoulds\u2019, isn\u2019t it? And sometimes they can feel overwhelming. Now that I\u2019m diabetic, there are certain things I do that have an immediate impact on how I feel \u2013 how my blood sugar reacts, and how much energy and vitality I have. I\u2019m sorry to say there aren\u2019t any big surprises here, but these are the things that contribute most to my daily well-being. 1 The right kind of food. A balanced diet with plenty of fresh vegetables, some fruit, good proteins and a moderate amount of the right carbs. Little to no junk food, fast food or refined carbs. 2 Regular exercise. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense, and it doesn\u2019t have to be for long, but if I do 30 minutes of yoga five times a week my blood sugar (and my body!) thanks me. 3 Enough sleep. Easier said than done on some nights, but getting enough sleep is essential for getting the cortisol (stress hormone) out of my system. 4 Manageable stress. Cortisol is released when we\u2019re stressed, and it inhibits the effect of insulin, which means it gives me high blood sugar and makes me feel dreadful (on top of stressed!). 5 A positive attitude. Diabetes is unpredictable at the best of times. If I beat myself up about every high or low blood sugar reading, I would be black and blue. So I have to try my best and then let go\u2026 Good advice for diabetes and life!.

VNo compromise \u2014 sporty, luxurious, practical.  Ten years ago, if you had told us that one of the many new luxury segments to develop would be sedan-style hatchbacks, we'd have said you'd lost your mind. And yet, here we are today with not one, but four competing in just such a niche segment: The Kia Stinger, Buick Regal Sportback, BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo and Audi A5. That's just in one size and price bracket. Two of the manufacturers listed here make larger versions of each hatchback. We aren't entirely sure how it happened, but we're not going to complain, because we love the idea of a car with almost no compromise: luxury features, sporty performance, and plenty of practicality.  One of the reasons we're taking a look at these cars right now is that Kia has recently released pricing for its entry in the segment, the Stinger and Stinger GT. Buick wasn't far behind with the Regal Sportback and Regal GS, nor was Audi with the A5 and S5. So it seemed like an appropriate moment to look at the numbers and see which come out ahead or behind, with victors in each category highlighted with bold and underlined text.  What we found when comparing these cars' statistics is that each one has a clear area of expertise. For performance, it's hard to beat the four-cylinder Kia Stinger and the V6 Stinger GT. The four-banger has the most horsepower of the four cars, and is just behind on torque. The V6 has the most power and torque among the six-cylinder versions. The Stingers are also the second lightest of the group when equipped with rear-wheel drive, though they fall to third with all-wheel drive.  Space is a split between the Buick Regals and BMW 3 Series Gran Turismos. The Buicks have the most cargo space with the rear seats up or folded by a significant margin. The BMW on the other hand generally offers more space for passengers. It's up to you what's most important.  When it comes to cost, nothing can beat the four-cylinder Regal's base price of under $26,000. But if a V6 is what you're after, the Stinger GT is the cheapest. Neither matches the Audi A5 and S5 for fuel economy, though. Both Audis have the highest numbers for city, highway, and combined EPA estimates.

VFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks onstage during the tour for her new book 'What Happened' in Atlanta, Georgia. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more investigation into sexual assault allegations brought against President Donald Trump, equating them with those leveled against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. \u201cWe have a man who\u2019s accused of sexual assault sitting in the Oval Office, don\u2019t we? The very credible accusations against him have not been taken seriously,\u201d Clinton said during an interview with 77 WABC Radio\u2019s Rita Cosby. \u201cWe can\u2019t excuse the president from this debate.\u201d. Later, Clinton added that Trump \u201chas disgraced the office.\u201d. During the interview, Clinton also praised the way Sen. Al Franken dealt with sexual misconduct allegations recently brought against him, saying his actions provide a model for men like Trump and Moore. \u201cAl\u2019s very quick acceptance of responsibility and apology and his willingness to be investigated and to take the consequences is the kind of accountability I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t hear that from Roy Moore or Donald Trump, do you?\u201d. Clinton also addressed her husband\u2019s checkered past \u2014 which includes a series of sexual assault allegations in the late 1990s, some of which Clinton publicly denied \u2014 after being pressed by Cosby, standing by the investigation into his actions. \u201cI think every situation has to be judged on its own merit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should give the people who make such allegations the benefit of the doubt, that\u2019s what our system does, but then you have to investigate them, and that\u2019s what happened in the late \u201990s.\u201d.

VLooks like Apple lovers are going to have to wait a little longer for smart, room-filling sound. Apple announced on Friday it will delay the release of the HomePod, a smart speaker set to directly compete with the Amazon Echo, until early 2018. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple's breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it\u2019s ready for our customers," Apple wrote in an email to Mashable. "We\u2019ll start shipping in the U.S., UK and Australia in early 2018.". Apple debuted the device in June at their Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and originally planned to release the HomePod in December of 2017. With the price tag set at $349 per speaker, that would have been quite the holiday season windfall. What Apple claims makes the speaker really stand out from the crowd of networked home assistant speakers is its sound quality: The device sonically assesses the room it's in, and adjusts the speakers so that the sound best fills each individual space that it occupies. . Guess we'll just have to hold out a little longer to experience that first-hand, but from our brief time with the product in June, the HomePod might actually be worth the wait.

VIn 2015, Mandy Bowman founded Official Black Wall Street, a website that features a global directory of black-owned businesses. Blavity reports, this week the site made it even easier to find black-owned businesses near you through a new app. Also called Black Wall Street, the iOS and Android app helps you find black-owned businesses near you. Each entry offers directions to the business, images of what you can buy there, and reviews from others that have been there previously. You can set up alerts to get a notification when you pass by a black-owned store so you can make a point to pop in (or visit later on), and get special offers that you can redeem while shopping. Image: Official Black Wall Street. The app really shines for brick-and-mortar stores, but listings also include online shopping opportunities. Black entrepreneurs can also create listings for their businesses within the app, and a two-way messaging feature allows customers to potentially interact directly with business owners.

VThe fish cakes were crammed with chunks of fish and prawn. Kung Thai. Where: 59 Adelaide Tambo Drive, Durban North, Durban, 4051. We had booked as it was a Saturday evening and were not sure how busy it would be. As it turned out, the restaurant started filling up and there was a nice buzz there. We were shown to a table along a wall, which was a good spot. We ordered lime and soda (R27) and a Millers (R24) while scanning the menu. Several portraits of the much-loved Thai monarch, who died about a year ago, hung on the wall leading to the kitchen. The room is big and comfortable with an impressive wine area. Diners can also sit on the balcony. For starters, we ordered fish cake Tod Mun (R35) and pork belly (R35). The fish cakes were crammed with chunks of fish and prawn, accompanied by a winning cucumber and chilli-based sauce. The pork belly was wonderful with crispy skin and full of flavour. For mains, my companion had the honey-glazed chicken (R122), which contained grilled, sliced chicken breast, served on a bed of wok-fried noodles and a honey-based sauce. My dish was the steamed fish (R149) with a sauce of ginger, coriander, honey, lemon-grass and lemon juice. Accompanying the dish was egg-fried rice (R11). The chicken was tender, served on rice and vegetables, and the sauce was not too sweet. The fish was surprisingly firm and served on steamed vegetables. It was excellent. To go with our meals, we ordered a glass of Excelsior merlot (R34) and Excelsior sauvignon blanc (R28). We were happy to stop eating but the waitress suggested their special dessert, the pasoom combination platter (R59), which was popular with other diners. This consisted of balls filled with minced banana and sweet potato, sesame seed batter coated in fresh orange, lime ginger, honey sauce, banana chips tossed in honey, syrup, pecan nuts and cinnamon. In there somewhere was also ice cream with a chilli-choc sauce. This was one of a kind and delicious.  After this, we settled for two cappuccinos (R19). It was a great evening out. Food: 4. Ambience: 3½. Service: 4. The Independent on Saturday.

VAbuja - Nigeria's former national security adviser on Friday denied illegally channelling money meant for the fight against Boko Haram to fund Goodluck Jonathan's failed re-election campaign. Sambo Dasuki told the Federal High Court in Abuja that he "did not enter into an unlawful act with respect to any transaction" with Olisa Metuh, who is on trial for corruption. Metuh, the former spokesperson for Jonathan's Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is accused of receiving $1.1m from Dasuki before the 2015 vote. The money allegedly came from defence funds earmarked to buy weapons and equipment for the Nigerian military tackling the Islamist militants in the country's remote northeast. At the time, the army was being out-gunned and out-manoeuvred by the jihadists, whose insurgency has left at least 20 000 dead and more than 2.6 million homeless since 2009. The case is one of the most high-profile in a series of trials linked to President Muhammadu Buhari's campaign against endemic corruption. Both Dasuki, who is on trial separately accused of sending the defence cash to other prominent PDP members, and Metuh have said Jonathan was aware of the transactions . But the former head of state, whose wife and other close family members are facing claims of graft, is not thought to have been questioned. Jonathan has been summonsed to appear as a witness in the Metuh trial but his lawyer said earlier this week that he was "not the proper person to testify". The court also threw out a request for him to receive the equivalent of $2.7m to cover his security and logistics costs to attend the trial. Dasuki, appearing as a defence witness, told Metuh's lawyer that he followed lawful procedure in all his transactions while in office between 2012 and 2015. The alleged contract with Metuh's company and records of an electronic payment of the money have been shown to the court but Dasuki said he had "nothing to say". "I have already mentioned, for any details I have to make reference to my records," he told the court. Judge Okon Abang discharged Dasuki from the witness box and adjourned the case until December 4.

V\u2018If nothing is done between now and the budget presentation in February, then things will become a lot more difficult on the fiscal front\u2019. SA will face more fiscal difficulties and higher financing costs should state-owned companies\u2019 debt continue rising and if the nation\u2019s local debt is downgraded to junk, the International Monetary Fund says. If state entities such as cash-strapped power utility Eskom and South African Airways request more state support, the government will have to step in to help, removing fiscal space for "more socially useful activities", says Montfort Mlachila, the lender\u2019s senior resident representative in the country. "If the current fiscal problems are not addressed soon enough, it will obviously worsen the market sentiment and could increase the financing costs," he says. "If nothing is done between now and the budget presentation in February, then things will become a lot more difficult on the fiscal front.". Last month, Treasury almost halved its economic growth forecast for this year, to 0.7%, and said debt was predicted to rise. The deteriorating trajectory threatens to trigger a downgrade of SA\u2019s rand-denominated securities to junk by S&P Global Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Fitch Ratings already assesses the local-currency debt as sub-investment grade. SA projects a revenue shortfall of R50.8bn for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, and sees public debt exceeding 60% of gross domestic product by 2021. Despite the predicted widening fiscal gaps, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba did not want to "deviate irretrievably from the fiscal consolidation agenda", he said in his medium-term budget presented on October 25. The country has not approached the IMF for help, Mlachila says. "If SA were to come to the IMF, we would obviously be ready to assist.". The sustainability of the nation\u2019s debt would be at risk unless government presented a credible fiscal consolidation plan in 2018, Moody\u2019s said on October 30. The change in policy direction away from a focus on fiscal consolidation was faster than expected, Fitch said on October 26. Moody\u2019s assesses the nation\u2019s foreign-and local-currency debt at one level above junk and is scheduled to make an announcement on November 24. S&P, which is also due to review its reading the same day, has SA\u2019s rand debt at the lowest investment grade, and foreign securities at the highest junk level. Bloomberg.

VYahya Jammeh listens to one of his aides in Banjul on November 29, 2016, during the closing rally of the electoral campaign of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC). More than 880,000 voters are expected to cast their ballots when the west African country goes to the polls on December 1, 2016. Jammeh has won four elections with his ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction, following a 2002 constitutional amendment lifting term limits. Rights bodies and media watchdogs including Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accuse Jammeh of cultivating a \u201cpervasive climate of fear\u201d and of crushing dissent against his regime, one cause of the mass exodus of Gambian youths to Europe. / AFP PHOTO / MARCO LONGARI. A dozen Gambian soldiers will face charges for nine different offences, an army spokesman told AFP on Saturday, amid fears that a faction of the military remains loyal to ex-president Yahya Jammeh. The charges were laid out at a court martial hearing held on Friday, where 12 officers were presented to a military panel and a civilian judge in a case shrouded in secrecy. \u201cTwelve army officers were arraigned before a court martial at Yundum barracks yesterday,\u201d army spokesman Lamin Sanyang told AFP. \u201cThey are charged with nine criminal counts, but for now I cannot go into the details,\u201d he added. Pleas will be entered on November 27, when the men are expected to be formally charged. Separately, military sources told AFP the charges relate to sedition accusations and suspicions of loyalty to former President Jammeh, who ruled the small west African nation with an iron fist for 22 years. A coalition of opposition parties fielded standard-bearer Adama Barrow as their candidate in December 2016 elections, who ultimately defeated Jammeh and took over the presidency in late January. There have been concerns about lingering Jammeh supporters in the ranks of the army, evoked back in July by Colonel Magatte Ndiaye, the head of a Senegalese army contingent still deployed to The Gambia by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). He told AFP that rebel elements were intent on destabilising the country and working with exiled Jammeh-era top brass, though President Barrow has said such reports are \u201chugely exaggerated\u201d.

V The Senegalese forward heaped praise on David Unsworth\u2019s men for their doggedness after settling for a stalemate at Selhurst Park . Everton forward Oumar Niasse has lauded his teammates for their fighting spirit in their 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace in Saturday\u2019s Premier League encounter. . The Toffees fought their way back to pick a point at Selhurst Park. Goals from Leighton Baines and the 27-year-old striker cancelled out efforts from James McArthur and Wilfried Zaha as the Merseyside club avoided their seventh defeat of the campaign. Despite their struggles in the English top-flight this season, the right-footed forward praised the team's spirit and charged his teammates to keep fighting when they visit the St. Mary\u2019s Stadium to battle Southampton for their next top-flight game. \u201cThe past few months have been difficult but it is always good to get a point, especially away from home, and now we need to work for next week [away at Southampton],\u201d Niasse told club website. \u201cCrystal Palace started the season badly, but they have some great players. It is difficult to play them away \u2013 their stadium is tough \u2013 you need to focus and fight every time. "The confidence is coming into the team, because in the last game (against Watford) we were 2-0 down and won 3-2. Then Palace were ahead twice and we came back. \u201cWe did not give up and the team is getting better and better.\u201d. Niasse expressed delight after his effort - which made it five goals from seven Premier League games this season - helped Everton earn a point. \u201cIt is difficult for me, because for two seasons in a row I did not have a proper pre-season,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have to work harder and keep running to get my fitness back. I am getting better and better and we will see at the end of the season what happens. \u201cBut I am happy to get a goal and help my team," he concluded.

VHonda Motor Co. is recalling about 800,000 of its Odyssey minivans in the U.S. after receiving 46 reports of injuries over faulty passenger seats. The company will repair the seats free of charge for owners of 2011-2017 models, it said in a statement Saturday. \u201cIf a second-row seat is not properly latched after adjusting it side-to-side or reinstalling a removed seat, the seat may tip forward during moderate to heavy braking, increasing the risk of injury to an occupant,\u201d the company said in the statement. Honda said it\u2019s looking into how best to repair the seats and will start notifying owners of the fault via mail beginning in late December. The recall comes two months after Honda agreed to pay $484 million to settle economic-loss claims tied to Takata Corp. air-bag recalls. As of mid-September, about 20 million vehicles containing defective Takata air-bag inflators still haven\u2019t been fixed, 64 percent of the 31.5 million vehicles containing the defective parts, according to a progress report.

It was jubilation galore as the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party was declared winner at Amatutu polling unit, Agulu 2, located in front of the home of former governor, Mr. Peter Obi, in the ongoing Anambra governorship election. The presiding officer announced the result as follows; APC: 5 votes, APGA 40 votes, UPP; one vote, PDC; two votes, while PDP secured a whopping 145 votes from the polling unit. Voters in the unit, consisting mainly of women, erupted in wild jubilation over the result upon its announcement. Our correspondent gathered that the reason for the jubilation was because Governor Obiano had allegedly mobilised funds to the unit in the hope of buying up votes to humiliate his arch rival, Mr. Obi.

VThe first trailer for the movie adaptation of the arcade game Rampage has arrived. While photos from the movie previously released showed star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson among chaos and destruction, this is the first look at the mutated monsters causing all the trouble. Rampage follows primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), as he attempts to save his best friend, a silverback gorilla named George, who has mutated into a gigantic creature capable of tearing down buildings. George isn't the only mutant, though. There's also a massive wolf shown in the trailer, which seems to have a much less friendly disposition than the gorilla. If you've wondering about Lizzie, the giant lizard from the game, never fear. While the trailer mostly follows George and Ralph--the name of the wolf in the game--it ends with the arrival of Lizzie. The massive lizard reveals itself after surfacing in a river. "I was just thinking the only thing that's missing right now is a giant crocodile," Johnson's character says. Rampage also stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is essentially just playing his The Walking Dead role of Negan here, Malin Ackerman (Watchmen), and Naomie Harris (Moonlight). It smashes into theaters on April 20, 2018.

VIn Brief.  In a first-ever demonstration, researchers showed how ultrafast and short pulses of light can directly affect the firing of neurons. They hope that this might lead to advanced light therapies for mental health disorders. . Light Therapy. A host of mental health issues have been tied to light: from trouble related to our circadian rhythms to seasonally-related mood disorders, light can have a profound impact on our health. In a new study, researchers have put this long-held theory to the test using specially crafted ultrafast light pulses that can trigger neurons to fire, as well as altering the patterns in which they fire. The study, published in the journal Nature Physics, was completed in mice by a team of researchers at the University of Illinois, led by Dr. Stephen Boppart. It\u2019s the first demonstration of coherent control, a practice using light beams to control functionality within a living cell. The success of this demonstration could allow researchers to develop new methods for treating mental health disorders in the future by using light to direct neural activity. Dr. Boppart and his team used optogenetic mouse neurons, cells with added genes to make them responsive to light. While the team modified these cells, the researchers assert that the same results should be possible in cells that are naturally sensitive to light, like those found in the retina. Dr. Boppart stated that \u201cThe saying, \u2018The eye is the window to the soul\u2019 has some merit, because our bodies respond to light. Photoreceptors in our retinas connect to different parts in the brain that control mood, metabolic rhythms and circadian rhythms.\u201d . Neurons have been shown to fire in different patterns in reaction to light pulses. Image Credit: Stephen Boppart, University of Illinois. Circadian Science. In nature, biological systems that use and are affected by light do so with the light from the Sun. But within this controlled experiment, the research team used fast pulses of light less than 100 femtoseconds long. This has a different effect than naturally-derived light sources, as it\u2019s a large quantity of energy in a short period of time. The team changed both the length of the pulses and their wavelengths to truly explore the different responses that were possible. While this first true demonstration of this ability is more of the first step than a complete conclusion, the team is confident that their methods could have clinical applications one day. Dr. Boppart remarked that \u201cUltimately, this could be a gene-free, drug-free way of regulating cell and tissue function. We think there could be \u2018opto-ceuticals,\u2019 methods of treating patients with light.\u201d.

VEddie Jones has said Australia will face a hungry England team at Twickenham on Saturday, live on Sky Sports. Saracens' Owen Farrell is back in the starting line-up after being rested for the autumn opener against Argentina. Farrell is picked at inside centre in place of Henry Slade, who drops to the replacements' bench, in one of two changes in personnel to the backline that helped topple the Pumas 21-8. Another British and Irish Lions summer tourist Maro Itoje, who was also rested against Argentina, must settle for a place among the replacements. "You've just got to look at it, [that] we've brought back four players, all class players. Two of them nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year so they're not short of ability," Jones told Sky Sports News. "Maro comes off the bench. Owen's a strong defender, good communicator, great goal-kicker and George Ford, knowing they're controlling the attack, it will just give us more poise probably.". Owen Farrell is back at inside centre to face the Wallabies. Australian Jones admitted he was looking forward to pitting his wits against his compatriots, hoping to add to the four wins over the team he coached from 2001 to 2005 as part of a sequence of 20 victories from 21 Tests in charge of England. The Wallabies come into the match fresh from a 29-21 win over Wales in Cardiff and Jones said: "Yeah it's a bit of fun this week. England-Australia is always a big game and obviously me being Australian makes it more interesting. "I'm really looking forward to this game. It's a great chance for us to test ourselves against probably the form team in the world. "I think they've improved considerably but you've got to remember when we last played them they were the World Cup finalists and, so, they've always been a good team they've just had some lapses in form. "But they're certainly in-form at the moment.".

VThis year has seen a number of interesting smartphones from Nokia, with parent company HMD Global releasing devices that cover a number of price-points in the Android market. Unfortunately only a few of these models have made their way to the US, including the mid-range Nokia 6 and the retro-inspired, non-smart Nokia 3310. It appears that\u2019s about to change, as the super cheap Nokia 2 will soon be on sale here. A listing for the Nokia 2 has appeared on Amazon, complete with a wallet-friendly $99 price. Available in black, white, or copper, the device is currently listed as \u201cout of stock,\u201d but will be available for purchase in the near future. Buyers will get an unlocked Nokia 2 that\u2019s compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile\u2019s networks (sorry, Verizon and Sprint users), and covered by a warranty. While the Nokia 2 clearly has entry-level specs, the two main things it has going for it are the dirt-cheap price and a huge 4,100mAh battery. The latter is said to give the device almost two full days of usage between charges, paired with the fact that the display and chipset are designed to use as little power as possible. Along with the large battery, the phone features a 5-inch 720p display, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor with 1GB of RAM. There\u2019s also 8GB of storage with microSD card support, 5MP and 8MP cameras on the front and rear, respectively, and a durable chassis made from an aluminum frame and polycarbonate shell. It ships with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but is said to get the upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo at some point down the line.

VGeorge Clooney is returning to TV. The 56-year-old actor-and-director \u2013 who became a household name playing Dr. Doug Ross in medical drama series E.R. from 1994 to 1999 \u2013 will star in and direct an adaptation of Joseph Heller\u2019s satirical novel Catch-22, Deadline reports. The six-part miniseries is being produced by Paramount Television and Anonymous Content, and is expected to begin production in 2018. Catch-22\u2013 which will have a script written by Luke Davies and David Michod \u2013 follows US airman Yossarian and his attempts to avoid the fighting in Italy during World War II, as he knows the situation is likely to end in death. But he runs up against the army\u2019s Catch-22 policy, which states that if someone is rational enough to try to evade combat, they are sane enough to continue fighting. George\u2019s role as the malicious Colonel Cathcart marks his first acting job since his appearance as a slick TV presenter held hostage in 2016\u2019s Money Monster. He will be joined as director on the show by his long-term collaborator Grant Heslov. The filmmaker \u2013 who has five-month-old twins Alexander and Ella with wife Amal \u2013 recently admitted he isn\u2019t as interested in acting as he used to be, and even the money doesn\u2019t really tempt him. He said: \u201cLook, I acted for a long time and, you know, I\u2019m 56. I\u2019m not the guy that gets the girl any more\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t be the guy that gets the girl. \u201cBut, look, if somebody\u2019s got Paul Newman in \u2018The Verdict\u2019, I\u2019d jump. But there aren\u2019t that many like that. \u201cActing used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f***ing dollars. I don\u2019t need money.\u201d.

VSamsung's Galaxy S9 launch is quickly approaching, and it looks like the company might have some big plans ahead. Image: Tom's Guide . In a series of social updates on Thursday (Nov. 16), serial leaker Ice Universe, who has been right more times than not with Galaxy rumors, said that Samsung is actually planning to release three new units next year. Two of them will be updates to existing models and called the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+. The third model, called the Galaxy S9 Mini, could come with a screen size somewhere in the 4-inch range. Additionally, Ice Universe, whose comments were earlier reported on by Forbes, said a variety of changes will be coming to the Galaxy S9 line. For instance, the Galaxy S9's cameras will likely shift with a broad-band anti-reflection (BBAR) coating. The feature, which is typically found in digital-SLRs exclusively, reduces glare and reflections on the camera lens to create better-looking images. The move appears to be part of a broader effort by Samsung to make one of the most powerful and capable cameras in the smartphone business. In addition to what Ice Universe discussed this week, reports are swirling that a variety of other high-end components will be coming to the Galaxy S9, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, the next iteration of this year's Snapdragon 835. Additionally, Samsung is said to be planning a 3D front-facing scanner that will identify a person's identity far more effectively than the 2D version in its current line of handsets. Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S9 in early 2018 and could release the device sometime in February or March.

VSamsung's latest device bearing the model number SM-J250F/DS that might just be Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) was accidentally confirmed by the company's South African division on November 16. The local unit launched a support page for the yet to be launched Android device. Samsung, however, hasn't confirmed anything on the technical specifications yet but the fact that SM-J250F will possess dual sim variant for specific territories has been confirmed. . Geekbench's database also released the international version of the device along with the technical specifications. Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) will be powered by Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 430 SoC. The model is said to come with 1.5GB to 2GB RAM with 32 GB internal space and a microSD card slot. . It is all geared up to feature Android 7.1.1 Nougat enhanced with Samsung Experience software suite. Since Samsung's software support for the Galaxy series has been a bit tipsy when upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo is concerned, there is no confirmation on the fact that Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) might sustain the Oreo upgrade. . The device is powered by octa-core SoC and can operate at a maximum frequency of 1.4 GHz which is the standard frequency for Qualcomm. . The accidental confirmation of Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) came right after another wing of Samsung released news about Galaxy A7 (2018). The Kazakhstani division of the company accidentally launched a support page for the device tagging it as SM-A730F/DS. It will have dual sim capability but all the versions might not support the same features. It might contain the Infinity Display panel present in the Galaxy S8 lineup and Galaxy Note 8 along with being IP68-certified with complete water and dust resistance. The device is all set to feature a 6-inch screen with Exynos 7885 SoC and 6 GB RAM. Galaxy J2 Pro will be launched by early 2018. .

VAnthony Watson is the recipient of the Gary Frisch Gay Times Honour: Entrepreneurship. Anthony Watson is a banking and technology entrepreneur who sits on the board of GLAAD, and who donates at least forty percent of his professional time to supporting charitable organisations and marginalised communities around the world. \u201cIf someone could give me a pill tomorrow and say \u2018this will make you straight\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t take it in a million years. I love the fact I\u2019m gay; I love our community,\u201d Anthony explains. \u201cI have achieved so much because of our community. I\u2019ve had support from people that I would never have interacted with in any shape or form, so I absolutely believe that being gay, identify as being gay in a positive way, has propelled me in ways that just wouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cI love the fact I\u2019m gay and wouldn\u2019t change it for the world!\u201d. Anthony was honoured at the National Portrait Gallery during the inaugural event on 18 November, introduced to the stage by Rob Curtis \u2013 managing director at Gaydar. Gary Frisch \u2013 whom the Honour is named after \u2013 was the founder of Gaydar, a website that would go on to connect 3.5 million users in 23 countries and pave the way for a myriad dating services globally. TWEET FROM THE NIGHT HERE. The Gay Times Honours recognise those who have had a tremendous impact on what it means for us to live openly and freely as LGBTQ people in modern Britain. There\u2019s much to be said about the enduring contributions of the individuals and organisations amplified by their inclusion in the Gay Times Honours, but celebrated queer writer and author Armistead Maupin perhaps sums it up best: \u201dThe world changes in direct proportion to the number of people willing to be honest about their lives. In a bid to highlight those who\u2019ve paved the way for justice, visibility and equality, the nine Honours are named posthumously after LGBTQ trailblazers. Created in close collaboration with Gay Times Curator, Gemma Rolls-Bentley, and the nine Honourees themselves, specially commissioned artworks were created to recognise and reflect on the contributions of the individuals, organisations and institutions being honoured. We\u2019d like to extend a special thank you to Gemma for the passion and enthusiasm she has brought to the Gay Times Honours. We\u2019d also like to thank our panel of educators, activists and creators who volunteered their time and who worked hard to ensure comprehensive representation of the LGBTQ experience across the shortlists and Honourees: Simon Millson, Topher Campbell, Polly Shute, Dr. Seb Buckle, Jacqui Gavin, Jon Huggett, Simon Black, Philippa Drew CB and James Frost. The Gay Times Honours 2017 was hosted by Jinkx Monsoon an Freida Slaves to an invited LGBT+ audience.

VWhich company will be the biggest in America, 100 years from now? Judging by the chart below, it\u2019s fair to say it may not be Apple . This chart from cost-calculating website HowMuch.Net uses Forbes data to identify which American companies were the top corporate giants over the past century. The size of the circle in the visualization corresponds to the company\u2019s valuation, adjusted for inflation to 2017 dollars. Companies are color-coded by industry. . As Raul Amoros for HowMuch.Net points out, the top 10 companies in each year are all different. In 1917, U.S. Steel reigned supreme, while in 1967, IBM was king. The year of 2017 has been dominated, no surprise, by iPhone maker Apple, which recently became the first public company to cross the $900 billion market capitalization milestone... and looks to be on the path toward $1 trillion (or even $2 trillion???). . One major takeaway from the chart is that today\u2019s tech giants are huge and valuable on a scale that we\u2019ve never seen before. In 1967, IBM was worth $258.6 billion, adjusted for inflation. That\u2019s a long way off from Apple\u2019s $900 billion perch today. . \u201cThe massive steel monopolies from a century ago pale in comparison to the size of tech companies today,\u201d writes Amoros. . \u201cThis suggests that the internet has concentrated financial power in the boardrooms of only a handful of companies like never before. This is one of the many reasons why tech companies have to worry about regulators busting up their monopolies,\u201d he says. But if the one constant on lists such as these is change, as Amoros says, \u201cYou can be sure that the top ten companies in 2067 will look substantially different than today, and just imagine what the list will look like in 2117.\u201d .

VWeststar Associates Limited, the authorised general distributors of Mercedes-Benz passenger and commercial vehicles in Nigeria, in collaboration with one of its authorised dealerships \u2013 Barbedos Cars Limited began a special vehicle service programme in Abuja this week that would end on December 8. Weststar said, in a statement, that this campaign was \u201cpart of the strategic directions aimed at achieving superior after-sales quality of service and enhancing customer relationship.\u201d. According to the company, \u201cThis service week campaign serves as an opportunity for Mercedes-Benz passenger car owners in Abuja to bring their cars to the workshop in preparation for the upcoming yuletide season.\u201d. Special offers for each week, they said would include \u201cfree diagnostics and engine checks, free labor for every car serviced, availability of genuine parts at special prices and also, free parts and service advice for the next five weeks. Due to concerns raised by the management over the increase in road accidents during the holiday season, the service campaign was initiated to help reduce the frequency of road casualties by attracting Mercedes-Benz customers to come partake in free service of their cars at a much more subsidised cost.\u201d. General Manager, Aftersales, Weststar Associates Limited, Michael Bromberger said, \u201cAt Weststar and its authorised dealerships nationwide, we believe that after-sales plays a critical role in the life-span of each Mercedes-Benz vehicle. Hence, with our highly qualified technicians and substantial availability of genuine spare parts, we intend to get our customers vehicles ready for the Christmas season starting with the Abuja dealership network. All our authorized dealerships are equipped to the highest standard in line with the Mercedes-Benz global benchmark.\u201d. The company said with the upcoming service weeks, \u201ccustomers can rest assured of the well-being of their cars as they prepare for family vacations in the coming month. This is Weststar\u2019s little contribution towards ensuring safe travels for Nigerians planning to commute to various locations across the country.\u201d.

November 5 saw the launch of the ICO for the unique project Connectius, a service that will increase transparency in the entire e-commerce industry. Connectius is a blockchain-based SaaS solution for e-commerce that allows companies to decrease their e-commerce-related losses due to the actions of dishonest customers during chargebacks or cardless transactions through the use of smart contracts. According to research findings, in 2016 approximately 8% of e-commerce income was lost to fraudulent activity, and almost 40% of all attempted transactions did not result in purchases. Connectius will help solve these problems, lower costs, and increase security for all of the ecosystem's participants: consumers of goods and services, who place orders within the system; suppliers, who provide these goods and services; and arbitrators, who resolve complicated situations between other users. Work on Connectius began back in 2016. The first Connectius-based mobile app, Connectius Experts, has already been developed. Using geolocation and smart matching, the app offers users a sorted list of people and organizations ready to sell the service they need. The funds raised during the ICO will be put toward further product development. Connectius tokens (CNT) will become a universal medium for all transactions within the system. It will be used as a means of value exchange for payment not just within the system, but also in apps based on the Connectius platform. The cost of goods and services will be given in US dollars, which will be instantaneously converted into tokens by an external service. \u201cCNT tokens are not a security or cryptocurrency. We don't see it as a means for speculation. Nevertheless, tokens are an important element of our system that will be needed by all participants in these relationships. The team's goal is to ensure the ease and security of goods exchange through the use of CNT tokens,\u201d explains Vasily Kozlov, Connectius founder and CEO, a blockchain enthusiast who has founded several companies. Before November 20 tokens can be purchased at a 20% discount. Fundraising will continue through December 20. The company plans to raise $31 million. Company name: Connectius.

VGreater Manchester Police dog Tyson. Good boy. A Greater Manchester Police dog named Tyson has been showered with treats (we hope) after tracking down three suspected armed bank robbers who allegedly stole a box of cash after striking a security worker with a crowbar. Tyson tracked three men down in a woodland area where the offenders drove after escaping the crime scene in a car. Tyson found them in dense undergrowth, according to Manchester Evening News. A 28-year-old man and 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. Sergeant Danny Kabal of Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit said: "This was a shocking incident where a security employee was violently attacked by three, brutal, offenders. "Thankfully, our specialist team, including Tyson the police dog, responded immediately and as a result, we have been able to make two arrests. The three robbers targeted a security worker carrying a box of cash at 4pm on Friday (17 November) at a bank on Stockport Road in Levenshulme. They demanded the worker hand over the box, then struck them, causing them to drop the box which they grabbed and escaped with. "Tyson's swift work shows how vital police dogs are in our fight against violent criminality. While we've made two arrests, our investigation continues and I'd ask anyone who has information that could help with our enquiries, to get in touch with us.". What a good boy.

VPresident Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe [Photo: BBC]. Wild celebrations were reported across Zimbabwe on Saturday moments after reports emerged that some lawmakers were plotting to remove the country\u2019s defiant president. Robert Mugabe has failed to stand down, days after the military seized control of the country\u2019s affairs. Zimbabwe Newsday reports Saturday that an opposition parliamentarian of the Movement for Democratic Change, James Maridadi, would raise the motion next week. The paper cited its sources as stating that the articles of impeachment could be moved as early as next week Tuesday \u2013 and that the Speaker had been informed. Local media reports said members of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF would likely endorse the impeachment proceeding in order to pave way for a new leader. . The report has further raised the hopes of Zimbabweans that the 93-year-old leader\u2019s days in office are numbered. It came hours after citizens held protests across the country to demand Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ouster and affirm their support for the military action. Mr. Mugabe was pushed aside in the early hours of Wednesday b\u200ey military leaders, in what many see as a potential end to the 37-year-old rule. He had vowed to be in charge of the country until his death. But a recent decision to make his wife, Grace, the president of the southern African nation, is believed to have prompted the military takeover. Military leaders in uniform took over state broadcaster, ZBC, on Tuesday, a day after the chief of army staff, Constantino Chiwenga, warned of possible military intervention due to an alleged inflammatory rhetoric of politicians. But the military has maintained that its intervention was not a coup. Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was sacked last week by Mr. Mugabe, is now widely believed to have been favoured by the military as the next leader. South African President Jacob Zuma sent his Defence Minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and State Security Minister, Bongani Bongo, to Zimbabwe to meet with Mr. Mugabe and the military Wednesday. The team held talks with Mr. Mugabe Thursday afternoon, although sources said the leader had refused to step down until he completes his current tenure. His current tenure expires next year. Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, has continued to demand Mr. Mugabe\u2019s resignation. In 2008, the MDC won a majority in parliamentary polls, defeating Mr. Mugabe\u2019s Zanu-PF. But Mr. Tsvangirai withdrew from the second round of the vote, sparking a crisis that eventually led to a power-sharing arrangement. The arrangement collapsed in 2013, prompting Mr. Tsvangirai to proceed on exile, where he\u2019d remained largely until returning to the country after yesterday\u2019s \u2018coup\u2019.

VNov 18, 2017 \u2013 No Right Thinking Nigerian Can Praise Okorocha For Using Imo State Money To Build Statues \u2013 Ohakim. Group Threatens To Destroy South African President Jacob Zuma Statue In Imo State. Former governor of Imo state, Ikedi Ohakim, has criticised Okorocha for spending the state resources on building statues. Ohakim, who handed power over to Okorocha in 2011, said that his successor had impoverished the people and failed \u201ccomprehensively\u201d in terms of leadership and development. He said, \u201cShould I praise Okorocha because civil servants now receive half of their salaries instead of 100 per cent? Should I praise his government for owing pensioners for over 30 months and recently issuing dud cheques to them? What exactly are those good works for which I was supposed to be showering praises on the governor?. \u201cThe fact is that no right-thinking Nigerian can praise Rochas. Our biggest industry, education, is in a free fall. Youth unemployment has risen to an unprecedented height. Executive promises are discarded like used napkins like the promise of conducting local government area election, which has been made eight times but discarded eight times. \u201cQuality and due process have been relegated to the background, leading to an unmitigated infrastructural disaster like roads collapsing within 90 days. There is also a deliberate strategy to destroy our judicial system. \u201cCourt orders are hardly obeyed, judicial quarters are bulldozed with recklessness and as of today, judicial officers are being owed 11 months\u2019 salaries, while monuments costing hundreds of millions of naira are being mounted for foreign dignitaries and whereas our children are killed in their countries.\u201d. Similarly, a group called the Igbo National Council said it was a show of shame by the Okorocha administration to have erected Zuma\u2019s statue in the state. INC also said that the naming of a street in Owerri after Zuma was unfortunate. INC President, Chilos Godsent, told Saturday PUNCH that South Africa, in recent times, had recorded the \u201cwanton killing of many Igbo youths who are doing business or working in South Africa in the name of xenophobia.\u201d. He said, \u201cZuma cannot be said to be a Nigerian or an Igbo patriot; he has not contributed in any capacity to the well-being of Imo State indigenes or the Igbo.\u201d. INC said the INC was, therefore, calling on Okorocha \u201cto immediately reverse the naming of a street in Owerri after Zuma and dismantle his statue.\u201d.

Coronel finished second to Mehdi Bennani in the Opening Race at WTCC JVCKENWOOD Race of Macau today having failed all season to finish in the top three. \u201cSomehow I\u2019ve never found the luck [at Macau] but last night I was in Sands [casino],\u201d Coronel explained. \u201cI put on number nine [my race number].

I knew in the mountain section I really had to push and there I was really on the limit everywhere for myself because this was my only chance. These are the results I need, especially at the end of the season. We saw in the last few races we couldn\u2019t do anything with the car any more and somehow we found the speed in the mountain section so I\u2019m really happy.\u201d. Having started second for the Opening Race, the ROAL Motorsport-run Dutchman will start tomorrow\u2019s Main Race eighth. .

VTD Ameritrade is seeing increasing optimism on the part of investors, with short interest declining by a double-digit percentage during October. As of Oct. 13, The Ledger Gazette reported that short interest in the Omaha, Nebraska-based broker's stock stood at 9.2 million shares, down 19% from Sept. 29, when short interest stood at 11.4 million shares. In other words, about 1.8% of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation's (AMTD) stock is held by shorts, or investors betting that the stock price will decline. The declining short interest comes as the broker's share prices have been climbing and the company is seeing record interest in stock investing by its customers. The firm also had a strong showing in its third quarter, which bodes well for the stock price. [Looking for a reliable broker? Check out Investopedia's broker reviews first.]. TD Ameritrade stock was recently trading down $0.27, or 0.55%, to $48.82. In May, the stock fell to a 52-week low of $36.12, but it has recouped those losses and then some, climbing 33% higher since then. For 2017, TD Ameritrade stock is up 4%. Rival The Charles Schwab Corporation's (SCHW) stock is up 7% so far this year, while shares of E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC\u200b) are up 22%. For its fiscal fourth quarter, which TD Ameritrade reported in late October, the company was able to beat on the EPS and revenue fronts. It posted revenue of $983 million, which was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $965 million, and EPS of $0.49, also higher than the $0.46 Wall Street estimate. As of the end of October, TD Ameritrade said that clients made an average of 680,000 trades each day, which marks a 55% increase from a year ago and a 19% increase from September. Meanwhile, total client assets hit $1.14 trillion at the end of October, up 49% from last year and 2% from September. The company also said that average spread-based balances increased 31% from last year and 14% from September to $150.9 billion, while the average fee-based balance increased 29% from last October and 5% from September to $217.7 billion.

According to Yomi\u2019s post, Tope had an operation here in Nigeria and died in the process. Yomi is blaming the rot in the Healthcare system in Nigeria for the death of his friend.

VHector Bellerin says Mesut Ozil is hugely appreciated by his teammates and pointed to the German\u2019s influential performance against Sp*rs as proof that he gives everything for the Arsenal shirt. Ozil claimed his 45th assist for the Gunners, and made more key passes than anyone else, as he helped Arsene Wenger\u2019s men to a comprehensive 2-0 win in the North London derby. Substituted in the 84th minute he fully earned his standing ovation from the Emirates crowd. Speaking to Arsenal.com after the match, Bellerin noted: \u201cMesut is someone who gets a lot of criticism, but the players who are around him are very happy to have him and play with him. \u201cHe makes things easy for you. People sometimes talk about his body language, but he gives everything for this shirt. \u201cThe players who play around him know that he makes everything so much easier.\u201d. Bellerin drew special attention to the importance of the result, coming just days after important international games for so many of his peers. \u201cIt feels really good [to win],\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard over the past week. \u201cObviously, we had people going to play internationals and playing for their lives ahead of the World Cup, so it\u2019s been a hard few days. We\u2019ve done really well and we\u2019ve shown what we\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019m proud and very pleased for everyone.\u201d.

VJurgen Klopp has made four changes to his Liverpool side as they return from the international break to take on Southampton in the Premier League. The Reds head back to Anfield after departing for World Cup qualifiers and friendlies, taking on familiar opposition in Mauricio Pellegrino\u2019s Saints. Liverpool have signed five players from Southampton in the past three years, while Pellegrino spent two-and-a-half years on Merseyside, first as a player and then as assistant manager. Klopp was unsuccessful in his efforts to sign Virgil van Dijk last summer, leaving the Dutchman to line up against his suitors on Saturday. Meanwhile, Klopp has largely kept faith with the side that won 4-1 away to West Ham before the break, though he has been forced to deal with the absence of Joel Matip through injury. Simon Mignolet takes up duties in goal, behind a back four of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren, Ragnar Klavan and Alberto Moreno. In midfield, Jordan Henderson is joined by Georginio Wijnaldum and Philippe Coutinho, and Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino will operate in Klopp\u2019s forward line. Buoyed by the improving fitness of his squad, Klopp has been able to name Emre Can, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Daniel Sturridge among his substitutes at Anfield. Adam Lallana, who has returned from a long-term thigh injury, is not part of the squad. Liverpool are currently on a three-game winning streak, and with 13 games over the next 45 days, including 11 outings in the league, another victory is essential on Saturday. Liverpool: Mignolet; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Klavan, Moreno; Henderson, Wijnaldum, Coutinho; Salah, Mane, Firmino. Substitutes: Karius, Gomez, Milner, Can, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sturridge, Solanke.

Manager Chris Hughton has said Brighton must not forget the bigger picture as they look to build on a positive opening to the Premier League season. .  Stoke are the visitors at the Amex Stadium on Monday night, when the Seagulls will be seeking to extend a four-match unbeaten run. .  The sequence includes away wins at West Ham and then Swansea before the international break. .  Brighton have been on some journey since they last played in the top flight 34 years ago, during which the south-coast club were left homeless following the sale of the Goldstone Ground and fought back from the brink of liquidation. .  After finding themselves up as high as eighth place ahead of the international break, Hughton is determined to keep everyone grounded. .  His side are setting off on a testing run of fixtures which will take in matches against Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham before a trip to Chelsea on Boxing Day. .  "We have surpassed my expectations with where we are at this stage of the season," Hughton said. .  "I am delighted with it, but you just don't know how you're going to fare before the campaign, it was our first start in the Premier League and it is about sustaining it now. .  "I have been delighted by both the points total and the way we have conducted ourselves in matches as well." .  Hughton, who was appointed at Brighton on New Year's Eve 2014, is no stranger to keeping things in perspective, having taken Newcastle back up to the top flight and later helping Norwich retain their Premier League status. .  "We have done the big part of that (staying focused on our job) last season, from getting from the Championship to the Premier League which is where we want to be," the 58-year-old said, quoted on Brighton's official website. .  "Now it is about developing this team and developing this club that can be a club that can stay there." .  Hughton added: "With where we are and where we have come from, I don't think we'll be favourites too often ahead of matches, but we have played at a level to put ourselves where we are at the moment and so we have to focus on that." .

VCan\u2019t afford one of Tesla\u2019s big home batteries? It has a new alternative for you, and it\u2019ll fit in your pocket: the Tesla Powerbank. As you\u2019d expect from a powerbank, this model is designed to charge your smartphone, earbuds, or any other USB gadget, and it is small enough to fit in your pocket. The Tesla Powerbank is available now from the company\u2019s own website. The Tesla Powerbank was a recent addition to the company\u2019s lineup, one that costs $45 and sports a modest 3350mAh capacity. The model is far pricier than power banks of the same capacity from most other companies, but it\u2019s not much to pay to say you own a Tesla\u2026not to mention, we\u2019d expect the build quality for these are probably great compared to a random generic portable battery. The Powerbank has a design that is inspired by Tesla\u2019s own Superchargers; it includes the Tesla brand on it, a black body, silver inner portion, and two red cables that tuck into the device when not in use. One cable has a micro USB connector, the other an Apple Lightning connector. The micro USB cable is detachable, while the other isn\u2019t. The device has a charge indicator and what Tesla describes as high-efficiency circuitry. The output is a typical 1.5A/5V max, which is suitable for smartphones and other similarly small devices. If you want one of your own, put it on your wish list \u2014 Tesla is already sold out and it isn\u2019t clear when more will be in stock.

According to TMZ, the actor has been in the hospital for three days. The outlet reports that he is in need of a liver transplant and has kidney failure. Page Six reports that Cassidy's health is rapidly deteriorating, but that he is "conscious now and surrounded by family." The news comes after the actor revealed in February that he has dementia. The 67-year-old actor-singer told People magazine at the time that his family has a history of dementia and he had sensed "this was coming." Cassidy, whose song hits include "I Think I Love You" and "Cherish," said he would stop touring to focus on his health and "enjoy life.". Cassidy has had numerous personal problems in the decades following his initial success, ranging from substance abuse to bankruptcy.

VSami Khedira says it hurts to see Juventus teammate Gianluigi Buffon miss out on one last World Cup with Italy. Gianluigi Buffon is still recovering from Italy's failure to qualify for the World Cup and won't play for Juventus at Sampdoria on Sunday. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri announced on Saturday that defender Andrea Barzagli also won't play for the same reason. Both Buffon and Barzagli announced after Italy's playoff loss to Sweden on Monday that they were retiring from the national team. Allegri said: "They're getting over the disappointment but after 15 days with the national team they spent a notable amount of physical and -- above all -- mental energy. "It would have been Buffon's sixth World Cup and it was a big disappointment. But I found him in form. He had a good reaction.". He confirmed Buffon would return for the Champions League game against Barcelona next week. Allegri was also asked about the potential for him to replace Gian Piero Ventura as Italy manager. He said: "The national team is a future ambition, but right now I'm only focused on Juventus because we have plenty to do together. I'd talk about the opportunity in a few years.".

V ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) Thin at tight end, the Denver Broncos made a roster move Saturday that cost them their most productive player at the position.  Down to Virgil Green as their only healthy tight end, the Broncos (3-6) promoted former Wisconsin Badger Austin Traylor from their practice squad. To make room, they waived third-year pro A.J. Derby, who missed practice all week with a shoulder injury while Jeff Heuerman (knee) was also out.  Derby, who was acquired from New England in a trade last year, led Denver\u2019s tight ends with 19 catches for 224 yards and two TDs this season. Green and Heuerman have 15 receptions for 194 yards and two TDs combined.  Coach Vance Joseph said Friday he wouldn\u2019t go into Denver\u2019s game Sunday against the Bengals (3-6) without a second option at tight end. He considered using a tackle at the position but decided instead to promote Traylor, who\u2019s been on Denver\u2019s practice squad since Dec. 20, 2016.  Combined with an inability to develop a productive slot receiver, Denver\u2019s middling tight end production has bogged down the Broncos during their five-game losing streak, although it hasn\u2019t forced coordinator Mike McCoy to back off on his reliance on three-receiver sets as his base formation.  On Friday night, general manager John Elway gave his first-year head coach and his staff a vote of confidence while insisting it\u2019s up to the players to pull the Broncos out of their rut. He suggested the team had gotten \u201da little bit soft\u201d after a 3-1 start following a perfect preseason.  The Broncos have been outscored by almost 20 points a game during their losing streak.  \u2014.  For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL.  \u2014.

VA builder works on the roof of a home under construction in Jackson Township, Pa. (Keith Srakocic / Associated Press). Construction of new homes in the United States climbed 13.7% in October, the biggest jump in a year, as builders broke ground on more apartments and single-family houses. But the increase wasn't spread nationwide: Construction declined in the West. The Commerce Department said Friday that the monthly gain put U.S. housing starts at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That is the best pace for home construction in 12 months. Housing starts have risen just 2.4% year-to-date, largely because fewer apartment complexes are being built. Construction of single-family houses has driven much of the growth this year, a sign of greater demand from buyers in a healthy job market. But recent building trends reversed somewhat in October, with most of the momentum coming from apartment construction. The building of multi-family properties jumped 37.4% in October. Construction of single-family houses increased 5.3%. Still, the building of new homes has done little to alleviate the growing shortage of existing homes for sale. This shortage has started to stifle the broader real estate market. Purchases of existing homes have fallen over the past 12 months, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. The decline largely reflects that there are 121,600 fewer homes on the market during the same period, a 6.4% decrease that new construction has been unable to offset. "For a significant increase in new homes, municipalities are going to have to work harder to make more land available for building," said Robert Frick, a corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Construction in the South rose 17.2% last month compared with the month before, a sign the region is regaining its footing after damage from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Home construction shot up 42.2% in the Northeast thanks to groundbreakings for apartments. Construction increased 18.4% in the Midwest, but it declined 3.7% in the West. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 5.9% in October to 1.3 million.

VIt's only been days since Kim Kardashian dropped her trio of healing crystal-inspired KKW Beauty fragrances, but she's not wasting any time before her line's next product launch. In fact, she's been low-key teasing it for months. In an interview with People about her fragrances, Kardashian dropped the bomb that KKW Beauty lipsticks are coming next. "You have no idea\u2014I started wearing it at New York Fashion Week [in September],\u201d she told PeopleStyle. \u201cI posted this photo at the Alexander Wang show on my Instagram and I never had more people ask what lipstick it is in that photo. It was the most satisfying feeling when friends, makeup artists, everyone was like, \u2018What is this lip liner?'\u201d.  Alexander Wang Gang. A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 17, 2017 at 4:06pm PDT. Kardashian didn't share what we can expect in terms of colors and formulas, but considering that a nude lip is just as much a part of her signature beauty look as a killer contour, we're willing to bet that Kardashian comes out with her version of the perfect nude lipstick. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been formulating,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cLip liners and lipsticks. I\u2019m so excited for them to come out. It\u2019s gonna be so good.\u201d. VIDEO: 9 Celebrities Who Struggle With Psoriasis . Kardashian's next launch may be exciting, but for real KKW Beauty stans, the news isn't surprising since the star gave her Instagram followers a more direct hint that she was going to be launching lipsticks back in September when she posted a photo of a lip print. A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 2, 2017 at 3:53pm PDT. As for when you can get your hands on KKW Beauty's lipsticks? That's TBA by Kardashian.

VCommunity engagement with police in Gauteng has yielded positive results, including the discovery of a dagga plantation in Muldersdrift on Friday. Gauteng police uncovered the large dagga plantation on Friday and destroyed around 3 000 dagga plants. Police, security companies and the community conducted an integrated operation in Muldersdrift, Johannesburg which led to the discovery of the plantation. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said no arrests were made. While in Muldersdrift, police also raided illegal liquor outlets, closed them down and confiscated volumes of liquor. In an unrelated case, police acted on a tip-off from the Duduza community on the East Rand and arrested a 42-year-old man, who was found with dagga worth an estimated street value of R600 000. "Meanwhile, working relations between the community and the police also paid off in Vila Lisa in Dawn Park. Police responded swiftly to information from the community and arrested a 20-year-old man for dealing in drugs," said Masondo. Masondo said communities have been responding positively to the call by Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange, to report criminal activities and to work with the police in exposing and arresting perpetrators of crime. "The power of community police relations goes a long way in fighting crime and cannot be undermined by the criminals," Masondo said.

President Jacob Zuma .  African National Congress .  SACP .  ANC stalwarts .  ANC stalwarts conference . JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has accused President Jacob Zuma of being the reason for the African National Congress (ANC)'s stalwarts' consultative conference. The ANC's alliance partner used its address on the second day of the conference to lash out at President Zuma, blaming him for much of what many say is the rot in the ANC. The SACP\u2019s Solly Mapaila says President Jacob Zuma has sold out the country. "He has donates our national sovereignty, our national independence to a grouping of individuals.". He says the president is largely to blame for the current state of the ANC. "He is presiding over a corrupt state system run by securocrats, who are dealing with anyone that they diffe with, who concoct wrong charges, and who incriminate and fabricate lies about individuals who do not agree with them.". Zuma has also been accused of undermining the ANC led alliance. Timeline. Zuma: Clean governance crucial for improved service delivery. Zuma: SA will not support unconstitutional change in Zim govt.

VWell, well, well, after more than a decade it looks we're finally getting a follow up to Disney's brilliant animated comedy The Incredibles. The sequel to the 2004 movie has been teased for years as director Brad Bird was waiting for a plot that would match or be better than the original. Finally, our prayers have been answered and the first look at The Incredibles 2 has been released. Credit: Disney. Bob/Mr Incredible, his wife, Helen/Elastigirl, and their three superhuman kids are back for more action and they are taking on the Underminer. For those that need a cheeky history lesson, that villain appeared right at the end of the first movie and appeared to be like a mole man, hell bent on destruction. . Writer and director Brad Bird told the Disney Animation Presentation at D23: "It's so great to be here to tell you about the film. It's fundamentally a story about family...with this new film, we're excited to jump back into that world. We have controls able to do so much more than before. "The whole world of Incredibles 2 is gonna be greatly expanded upon. We'll be seeing a lot more of Elastagirl.". Thankfully, some of the best characters will also appear alongside the Parr family, including Lucius Best/Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) and Edna Mode (Brad Bird). It'll be hard to top the 2004 original, which was praised by critics, won a bunch of awards, including two Oscars, and grossed more than $633 million (£479 million) at the Box Office. . Mr Bird has been tossing up with the idea of a sequel for years, first telling ComingSoon.net in 2007: "If I can come up with a Toy Story 2 with The Incredibles, then I would do it in a second. I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together.". He followed that up nearly seven years later by telling the Hollywood Reporter: "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world. "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that.". Obviously, he's managed to piece all his ideas together to release the movie that people have been waiting for for 15 years. But don't hold your breath, the film is expected to be released on June 15, 2018.  Featured Image Credit: Disney .

VJust a few months ago, Elon Musk pulled off one of the great coups in automotive history, launching the Model 3, the long-range, $35,000 car that will bring Tesla\u2019s electric ambitions to the masses. Since then, Tesla has been on shakier ground. Production problems followed the launch, high-ranking executives have left, and the company faces lawsuits accusing it of gender and racial discrimination. True to form, however, Musk hasn\u2019t let any such grim news keep him from his next great adventure: trucking. . And so we\u2019re here live in Los Angeles, where Musk will soon reveal a new kind of Tesla, an all-electric semitruck. For a company dedicated to making a difference, it\u2019s a good target: Heavy duty vehicles make up just 7 percent of vehicles on US roads, yet account for 20 percent of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. It\u2019s also hard to hit. Truck operators don\u2019t buy vehicles for their looks or fancy features. If the Tesla truck doesn\u2019t live up to to their expectations of range and cost, it will flop. . Musk has promised to take the stage at 8 pm Pacific (and he might just make this deadline), and we\u2019ll start our liveblog around 7. In the meantime, check out our rundown of what we expect from tonight\u2019s event. And if you want the deep scoop on Tesla\u2019s newest bid to save the planet from humanity, stick around and join WIRED\u2019s transportation team as we dissect and discuss the Tesla truck.

VGreater Manchester Police dog Tyson. Good boy. A Greater Manchester Police dog named Tyson has been showered with treats (we hope) after tracking down three suspected armed bank robbers who allegedly stole a box of cash after striking a security worker with a crowbar. Tyson tracked three men down in a woodland area where the offenders drove after escaping the crime scene in a car. Tyson found them in dense undergrowth, according to Manchester Evening News. A 28-year-old man and 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. Sergeant Danny Kabal of Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit said: "This was a shocking incident where a security employee was violently attacked by three, brutal, offenders. "Thankfully, our specialist team, including Tyson the police dog, responded immediately and as a result, we have been able to make two arrests. The three robbers targeted a security worker carrying a box of cash at 4pm on Friday (17 November) at a bank on Stockport Road in Levenshulme. They demanded the worker hand over the box, then struck them, causing them to drop the box which they grabbed and escaped with. "Tyson's swift work shows how vital police dogs are in our fight against violent criminality. While we've made two arrests, our investigation continues and I'd ask anyone who has information that could help with our enquiries, to get in touch with us.". What a good boy.

VPost-2009 stock-market returns looking unrealistic, San Francisco Fed paper finds. What goes up... A popular measure of valuing stocks looks set for a decline, and stock returns will suffer because of it, according to new research published Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings, or CAPE, ratio is the inflation-adjusted value of the S&P 500 index divided by the real earnings of companies in the index averaged over the most recent 10 years. . Going back to 1881, big run-ups in the CAPE ratio\u2014usually from the advent of new technologies including high-speed rail, automobiles and the internet\u2014were met with substantial decline in stock prices. The quarterly average CAPE ratio stands at around 30, exceeded only by the peak values of 43 in 2000 and 31 in 1929, according to a paper from San Francisco Fed research adviser Kevin Lansing. Lansing compared the CAPE ratio against different economic variables to determine whether it\u2019s signaling that stocks are overvalued. So far, the answer isn\u2019t really\u2014the actual CAPE ratio is about 8% above where a regression model that includes the natural rate of interest, potential GDP and core inflation suggests it should be. It was 40% above the fitted ratio in early 2000, at the peak of the internet bubble. But the projected path of that model implies a 13% decline in the CAPE ratio over the next 10 years. \u201cAll else being equal, stock returns in this case would be lower than those observed since 2009 when the CAPE ratio was doubling. Investors who expect high stock returns in the coming years based on recent market experience may end up being disappointed,\u201d he wrote.

VNew Delhi - A 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped for three months by three men including a 65-year-old watchman in India's central city of Bhopal, police said Saturday. The accused lived in the same neighbourhood and sexually assaulted the girl at a house owned by a woman, an accomplice in the crime. The girl had complained to her mother, a domestic helper, about the abuse on Thursday after which they approached the police. "The girl told us that the woman had offered her chocolates to lure her to her house where the accused committed the crime. They later threatened her not to tell anyone about it," police officer Shivnath Yaduvanshi said, adding that the abuse had been occurring since August. "We have arrested all four, including the woman for helping the men assault her. Neighbours angered [by] the crime also thrashed some of the accused," he added. The accused face charges of gang-rape and have been sent to jail pending trial. India has been in the spotlight in recent years over incidents of sexual violence against women. In 2012, the fatal gang rape of a student on a bus in New Delhi led to massive public outcry and tougher laws.

VA new FBI report indicates that hate crimes committed against white Americans are the fastest growing racial hate crimes in the United States. The FBI report on 2016 Hate Crime Statistics shows that in 2016, there were 876 reported anti-white hate crime offenses in the United States. In 2015, this number was 734, indicating a 19.34 percent increase. There were more racial hate crime offenses altogether in 2016 compared to 2015. There were 4,029 single-bias incidents that targeted \u201cRace/Ethnicity/Ancestry\u201d in 2015, compared to 4,229 in 2016. Anti-Hispanic or Latino hate crimes also increased in 2016. In 2015, the number of offenses targeting Hispanic/Latino Americans was 379. In 2016, that increased to 449, an increase of 18.46 percent. Anti-Black hate crimes actually declined by three offenses. Within religious hate crimes, there were also increases. Anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by 20 percent and anti-Islamic hate crimes increased by 26.57 percent. Anti-Catholic hate crimes also slightly increased. Since Donald Trump\u2019s election win, many mainstream media reports have centered on hate crimes being supposedly inspired by Donald Trump and his supporters. A number of these reports have turned out to be false. . Note: \u201cAnti-Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\u201d hate crime attacks were not included in this report as the numbers were too small to be statistically significant.

VThe Incredibles are back, and they have a laser baby. This is great news. Disney Pixar's first-ever look at The Incredibles 2 reveals that the youngest member of the superhuman family has a new power: Jack-Jack Parr can now shoot lasers out of his eyes. That's in addition to the shapeshifting, fire-making, and phasing powers he tapped into in the first movie. The #Incredibles2 trailer is here. See the film in theatres in 3D June 15, 2018. pic.twitter.com/episnabztB. \u2014 Disney\u2022Pixar (@DisneyPixar) November 18, 2017. While our first look at The Incredibles 2 focuses dad Bob Parr's adventures in babysitting, we learned over the summer that mom Helen Parr \u2014 aka "Elastigirl" \u2014 is the star of this new story. We don't know what global threat she's facing, but we're sure she can handle it. The trailer here raises more questions than it answers. Jack-Jack already had powers in The Incredibles, he just lacked control. And yet here we see Bob excitedly shout in Jack-Jack's face, "You have powers!" Maybe it's a flashback?. At least now we know when answers will be coming. The long-awaited sequel to Pixar's 2004 hit will be in theaters next summer, on June 15, 2018. UPDATED Nov. 18 at 11:28 a.m. ET An earlier version of this story erroneously identified Jack-Jack as a new member of The Incredibles family. In fact, Jack-Jack played a major role in the original movie. We regret the error.

VMore than 1,000 youth are expected to be recruited, trained and deployed as Community Policing Assistants (CPAs) under the National Youth Employment Agency (YEA) in the Western Region as part of efforts to help reduce the high unemployment in the country. The initiative forms part of partnership between the YEA and Ghana Police Service on Community Safety and Security Innovation aimed at helping to address youth unemployment in the country. In all, about 15,000 youth are expected to be recruited nationwide under the initiative. Several training courses are being offered to thousands of youth by the Agency in the areas of health, education and security to enable them gain meaningful employment. Alhaji Bashiri Ibrahim, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of YEA in-charge of operations, disclosed this at a sensitization workshop for personnel of the Police Service on the new Community Policing module in Takoradi on Friday. He emphasized that it was the responsibility of the police to protect the fundamental human rights of Ghanaian, adding \u201call of us are responsible players in that regard. That is why YEA saw it prudent to collaborate with the Ghana Police Service to carry out these efforts. He continued, \u201cOur mandate at YEA is to develop, coordinate and supervise the creation of jobs for the teeming youth to fulfilling not only the vision of Ghana Police Service but also that of the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo. Mr Bashiru appealed to the Police Service to give preference to trained beneficiaries after their period of engagement in relation to recruitment into the Service. COP Akuribah Yaagy, the Director-General of the National Patrol Department (NPD) of the Ghana Police Service, explained that the new community policing strategy focuses on improved visibility and accessibility in the communities to guarantee maximum protection. \u201cIt will also enhance services up to the standards of international best practices and the Police Service is also introducing a more professional, cost-effective and community friendly model of policing,\u201d he pointed out. According to him, the Community Policing Module is also to promote the image of the Police and public relations through community engagements. He encouraged all District Police Commanders to form neighbourhood watch dogs to assist the police in gathering intelligence in the communities to help combat crime. COP Yaagy urged officers of the service to stop violating the human rights of suspects, noting that those who break the law would not be spared. He also warned officers to avoid any acts that would dent the image of the Police Service. He pointed out that civilians\u2019 oversight body would be constituted for all the 6,000 electoral areas in the country for effective monitoring of the recruits. COP Yaagy indicated that security was a shared responsibility so all should work hard to combat crime.

VKeanu Reeves has survived a lot of crazy stuff. World-dominating machines. Bomb-laden bus rides. Traveling through time in a phone booth. But his biggest challenge of all: impressing bikers. This week, Reeves has abandoned Hollywood for Milan. The Italian city plays host to the Esposizione Internazionale Ciclo Motociclo e Accessori, or EICMA. He's not at the world's preeminent bike convention to gawk at the wares, however. He's unveiling three new motorcycles he has spent the past years of his life designing and building. \u201cIt\u2019s international, it\u2019s all the journalists and enthusiasts,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s let\u2019s plant our flag. Let\u2019s go to EICMA with three models, and hopefully people will really love what we make.\u201d. By us, he means Arch Motorcycle, the shop he founded with his business partner and friend Gard Hollinger. They teamed up in 2007, when Reeves, a two-wheel enthusiast, asked Hollinger, a well-known bike designer, to make him a custom ride. He was so impressed with the final product, he convinced Hollinger to start building and selling a version of the bike to rich but discerning riders. The KRGT-1 is designed, bespoke, for each customer in Arch\u2019s workshop just south of LA, for a price of around $78,000 and up. For years, creating variations on that one model kept Reeves and Hollinger creatively content, and Arch hummed along. Now, the young outfit is expanding its scope with three new bikes. One is an updated version of the original KRGT-1 for 2018, with tweaked looks, upgraded suspension, better brakes, and EURO 4 emissions compliance, so it can be sold on the other side of the pond. The Arch 1s is a single-sided swing arm that offers a sportier, more aggressive ride than the average cruiser. Rounding out the trio is the "ultra-exclusive" Arch Method 143. Reeves and Hollinger will only make 23 of these \u201cconcept production\u201d bikes. You can get a closeup look inside Arch's Southern California shop in the video above. Reeves and Hollinger won't announce pricing for the new models until next year, but don't expect to spend less than what you'd drop on a new BMW 5-Series. You can, however, expect to attract a lot more attention, and to have a way more excellent adventure.

V 'The Avengers' was the previous champ. . After less than a month in theaters, Disney and Pixar's latest animated film Coco has made history at Mexico's box office. . On Wednesday, Coco crossed the 827 million pesos mark ($43 million) to become the top-grossing film of all time in that market. The Avengers was the previous record-holder. Coco had its world premiere at the Morelia Film Festival on Oct. 20 and debuted in Mexican theaters on Oct. 27, where it has held the No. 1 spot for three consecutive weeks. It opens on Nov. 22 in the U.S. and Nov. 23 in China. Animated films tend to perform well in Mexico, so it comes as no surprise that a Day of the Dead movie featuring Mexican talent has enjoyed such phenomenal success. Coco has received mostly favorable reviews, including The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen calling it one of Disney-Pixar's "most engaging efforts.". Co-directors Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) and Adrian Molina (Monsters University) spent years traveling in Mexico and researching the culture and customs behind the age-old Dia de Muertos tradition. . The film features Benjamin Bratt and Mexico's own Gael Garcia Bernal, who did a little singing in the movie as well. .

V Los Angeles police are investigating. . Murray Miller. Girls writer Murray Miller has been accused of sexual assault by actress Aurora Perrineau, who filed a report on the alleged incident, Sgt. Salvador Rios of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. . While the actress filed the report at the West Hollywood station, Los Angeles police will handle the investigation, Rios said. . Perrineau has appeared in Passengers, the Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt starrer. Miller has also worked on King of the Hill and American Dad. No additional information was released. The writer, through his attorneys, denied the allegation. "Mr. Miller categorically and vehemently denies Ms. Perrineau\u2019s outrageous claims," attorney Don Walerstein said in a statement. "After being contacted several weeks ago by lawyers who \u2014 on Ms. Perrineau\u2019s behalf \u2014 sought substantial monetary damages from him, Mr. Miller\u2019s legal team gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims.". The statement added: "Only after her demands for money were rebuffed did Ms. Perrineau go to the police. Mr. Miller looks forward to sharing all evidence and information with any and all authorities seeking the truth in this matter." . Girls co-showrunners Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner sent a statement to THR late Friday, defending Miller: . "During the windfall of deeply necessary accusations over the last few months in Hollywood, we have been thrilled to see so many women\u2019s voices heard and dark experiences in this industry justified. It\u2019s a hugely important time of change and, like every feminist in Hollywood and beyond, we celebrate. But during every time of change there are also incidences of the culture, in its enthusiasm and zeal, taking down the wrong targets. We believe, having worked closely with him for more than half a decade, that this is the case with Murray Miller. While our first instinct is to listen to every woman\u2019s story, our insider knowledge of Murray\u2019s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year. It is a true shame to add to that number, as outside of Hollywood women still struggle to be believed. We stand by Murray and this is all we\u2019ll be saying about this issue.". A rep for Perrineau did not immediately respond to a request for comment. . TheWrap was first to report the allegation and police report. . 4:20 p.m.: Updated to include statement from Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner. .

VAdam Matos had also beaten the woman's mother to death with a hammer. Adam Matos may face the death penalty after his conviction on Thursday - Representational image. A Florida man who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend in front of their son before killing her parents and her new boyfriend has been found guilty of four killings. Adam Matos may face the death penalty after his conviction on Thursday (16 November), the Daily Mail reports. According to police reports, the 32-year-old first shot his ex Megan Brown and her father Greg Brown before battering Megan's mother and her new boyfriend, Nicholas Leonard, to death with a hammer at their Hudson home on 28 August, 2014. While confessing to his crime, Matos described how horribly he killed the four. He claimed that a combination of self-defence and "paranoia" drove him to murder them. Matos also did not show any remorse for leaving his then four-year-old autistic son at the crime scene while he went out to buy a shovel to bury the bodies. The bodies were found stacked four-high on a berm alongside a nearby road. He was arrested on 5 September, 2014 at a Tampa Bay area hotel with his missing son. In the court room, he described that fateful day of August 2014 as the "worst day of my life, a horrible experience, like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from", the Tampa Bay Times reported. Born in Philadelphia, Matos lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and New York City. He reportedly said he met Megan when he was 18 and she was 16 and after knowing each other for some months, she became pregnant with his child. But Megan's parents reportedly convinced her to move with them in Hudson and she told Matos she was taking their child. It was then that he decided to make the move. "I tried to convince her to stay. Tristan was born there, he had friends there, he was going to school, and there were beautiful parks he could go to there. It was a great place to raise our child," Matos had said. Local media reports said after the killings, the child was adopted by a new family.

VFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Battery-powered cars are not ready for mass production yet, the chairman of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp told a German magazine, adding that he did not see U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla as a role model. "Battery-powered cars with a long range are very expensive and it takes a long time to charge them," Takeshi Uchiyamada was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel. "Such cars do not fit in our program.". Toyota in September established a venture to develop electric vehicle technology with partner Mazda, seeking to catch up with rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars. Both automakers are somewhat behind their peers, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market yet. This contrasts with Tesla, which late on Thursday unveiled an electric heavy duty truck as well as a new roadster. "Tesla is not our enemy and not our role model," Uchiyamada said. "I think it's the German manufacturers that rather see Tesla as a competitor.". BMW and Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicles, defying skeptics who say they will need more radical designs to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-up carmakers. Uchiyamada said that Toyota was working on a new type of solid-state battery that is able to store more power and can be recharged much more quickly than current types. "This technology will be a big development step. But that will still take time. We expect mass production in four to five years.". On Friday, Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corp said they had agreed to cooperate in selling electric vehicles in India from around 2020, aiming to give each other a leg up in emerging markets and in low-emission technology.

V "In one case specifically, Sen. Franken admitted wrongdoing, and the president hasn't," Sanders said. "I think that's a very clear distinction." . The White House on Friday rejected comparisons between President Trump and Democratic Sen. Al Franken, both of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct, saying the difference between the two is Trump denied the claims made by more than a dozen women and went on to become president. At the White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to a question posed by a reporter over whether it would be fair to investigate the allegations against Trump after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans called for an investigation into Franken, who was accused of groping a woman without her consent. Sanders said the president had already addressed the allegations against him during the campaign. "The American people, I think, spoke very loud and clear when they elected this president," she said. Sanders said that Trump should not be investigated because "in one case specifically, Sen. Franken admitted wrongdoing, and the president hasn't.". "I think that's a very clear distinction," she said. Sarah Sanders says she has not asked President Trump why he never sued his sexual assault accusers, as he vowed to\u2026 https://t.co/Aidi3TWycy.   09:01 PM - 17 Nov 2017  . Trump himself has faced allegations from more than a dozen women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Most notably, during a 2005 Access Hollywood appearance Trump told former host Billy Bush: "When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything," including "grab 'em by the pussy.". Trump, who has not explicitly addressed the allegations of sexual misconduct against Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate for Alabama, slammed Franken in tweets Thursday night, calling him "Al Frankenstien.". Franken has apologized for his actions and said he would "gladly cooperate" with an ethics investigation. Last month, Sanders said the official White House position was that all the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying.

VThe representative of International Committee of the Red Cross (ACRC), Catherine Gribbin, expressed need for countries engaged in the fight against terrorism to understand the legal regime under which the war is domiciled and adhere to the rules of engagement to avoid unnecessary loss of lives, especially those of the civilian population. Speaking yesterday at a two-day technical assistance and strengthening of national and regional capacity to prevent acquisition and diversion of weapons in the Lake Chad basin, organised by the United Nations (UN) Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa (UNREC), in collaboration with the Small Arms Division of the ECOWAS Commission, as well as the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gribbin urged the military to ensure protection of civilian population, as well as respect rights of the arrested and detained suspected terrorists, as enshrined in international laws treaties. In attendance were officers of Nigerian Armed Forces, Customs, Immigration and other relevant agencies involved in the fight against illicit influx of arms in the country. Also at the event was the representative of the Counter-Terrorism Centre and the Institute for Security Studies (ISS Africa), which gave an evaluation study on the implementation of the regional approach towards combating illicit flows of arms and ammunition in the region. In his welcome address, Deputy Director, Political Affairs Officer, UNREC, Dr. Jiaming Miao, expressed fears that illicit proliferation, circulation and misuse of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) have become a widespread phenomenon in the Lake Chad Basin, which Nigeria is part of.  He added that the resulting humanitarian crises from the illicit influx of arms have constituted obstacles to socio-economic development and has led to increasing criminal and terrorist acts in Nigeria and neighbouring African countries. He stated that it was in recognition of the above development that the UN Security Council, by its resolution 2178 (2014), requested countries, among others measures, to prevent the acquisition and diversion of weapons by terrorist groups. A representative of ECOWAS, Mr. Oluwafisan Bankale, noted that the devastating effect of small arms in the region cannot be underestimated, as easy access to light weapons has elevated small arms to a level it could be described as weapons of mass destruction in the region. He added that arms diversion remained a challenge that must be overcome if Nigeria and indeed Africa are to experience meaningful development.

VNEARLY everyone in the country will have been a victim of cyber crime, police experts say. And some of their personal details will be for sale on the dark web. Cops claim nearly all Brits may have been victims of cyber crime. The revelation comes as cyber attacks, including some backed by foreign governments, soar. Police warned hackers also target businesses and infrastructure, such as the \u201cWannaCry\u201d attack on the NHS this year. Oliver Gower, head of the National Cyber Crime Unit, said: \u201cThere is a tendency to think this threat is some far away abstract thing. Hacking, data theft and ransomware are the modern burglary, theft, extortion or criminal damage. For several years we have said Russian-speaking nations are our No1 cyber crime threat. \u201cWith cyber criminal capability available to the highest bidder, it's inevitable hostile states will explore its possibilities.\u201d. But of the estimated two million cyber-dependent crimes in the past 12 months, only about 30,000 have been reported, so authorities do not have a full understanding of the threat. Chief Constable Peter Goodman, leader of cyber crime at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said: \u201cI can guarantee almost everybody in this country has had some sort of data breach against them. \u201cSome of their personal data is being held on the dark web and being traded. The industry should be taking security into account more when they design and build products.\u201d.  Fake Twitter accounts targeting EU referendum for Brexit 'co-ordinated by Russia' .

VIt's launching 15 models and plans to sell 1.5 million of them per year there by 2025. GUANGZHOU, China \u2014 Volkswagen Group said on Thursday it plans to spend 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) by 2025 to develop and manufacture all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles as it seeks to comply with upcoming stringent rules in China. The group, which includes Volkswagen AG and Audi AG, intends to launch 15 of the so-called new energy vehicles (NEV) models over the next two to three years, and an additional 25 after 2025, China chief Jochem Heizmann told Reuters on Thursday. China's NEV production and sales quotas, which must be met by 2019, have prompted a flurry of electric car deals and new launches as automakers in China race to ensure they do not fall short. Automakers that do fall short will be required to buy credits. Volkswagen currently has around 10 NEVs already on the market in China, although all are imported models with limited sales volumes, according to a company spokeswoman. Heizmann, speaking ahead of the Guangzhou auto show, added that the group is aiming to sell 400,000 new energy vehicles per year in China by 2020 and 1.5 million per year by 2025. NEVs refer to all-electric battery cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrids. Heizmann said some of those models will have a 400- to 600-km driving range \u2014 that's up to 370 miles \u2014 on a single full charge. By comparison, Tesla's Model S has a range of 490 km and as much as 632 km depending on battery capacity. The Volkswagen Group is also confident that its group companies and their local China joint venture partners will be able to generate enough NEV sales volume to account for NEV quotas by 2019, Heizmann said, adding that there will be no need to buy credits. "We need high volumes of new energy vehicles ... we are working on full speed on that.". Last week, General Motors' China chief Matt Tsien told reporters GM's China joint ventures will be able to generate enough NEV sales volume to meet NEV quotas by 2019 and without the need to buy credits. Tsien said both GM and its China joint-venture partners "are working to at least meet, if not exceed, those credit mandate requirements.". The Guangzhou auto show starts on Friday.
