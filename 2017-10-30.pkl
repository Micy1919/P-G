VA 60-year-old man, Nuhu Mohammed, on Thursday pleaded guilty to raping his 12-year-old daughter and her 13-year-old friend. Mohammed, who appeared before a Minna Magistrate\u2019s Court, is standing trial on a one-count charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with two minors. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the offence runs contrary to Section 18(2) of the Child Rights Law of Niger State 2010. Mohammed, after pleading guilty to the offence, begged the court for leniency. NAN reports that his plea was, however, not taken by the Magistrate, Fati Auna, on the grounds that her court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. Auna directed the Police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice, and ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison pending the advice. She, thereafter, adjourned the matter until Nov. 16, for further mention. The Police Prosecutor, Mr Emmanuel Danladi, had told the court that one Ahmad Aliyu of Garatu village in Bosso Local Government of Niger, reported the matter at the Kpakungu Police Station, on Oct. 17. Danladi alleged that the defendant had lured the two minors into his shop and had carnal knowledge of them. He further told the court that the defendant confessed to the crime during police investigation.

VPhoto: L: Rodrigo Varela/Getty Images for Univision, M: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images, R: Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images. Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez and Marc Anthony\u2019s star-studded disaster relief concert, One Voice: Somos Live!, helped raise over $35 million. The concert, held to raise money for those affected by the natural disasters in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas, Mexico and more, was broadcast on Saturday across multiple platforms. Lopez, 48, and the former baseball player personally raised $26 million in corporate pledges and donations prior to the event from the business, sports and entertainment industry, with the rest of the money coming from the telecast. . "With the disasters and tragedies befalling us almost weekly, and the swirling negativity dividing our country, it was gratifying to see people of all ages, races and background come together to support and help those in need,\u201d Lopez expressed in a statement. "Alex and I were amazed by the amount of love, unity and donations that were received. And I am personally overcome with gratitude for all the incredible artists and talent who showed up in both Los Angeles and Miami to perform, answer phones or lend their services. While there is still much to do, we are deeply grateful for all that\u2019s been done. We are, and will continue to be, one voice.". Rodriguez also echoed J.Lo\u2019s sentiments, adding, \u201cIt has been an incredibly difficult time for the people in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. These people were the first to answer our call to help with this cause. We are profoundly grateful to them and all those who came together to help make a difference.". Somos Live! included performances by Demi Lovato, Maroon 5, Ricky Martin, Camila Cabello, Gwen Stefani, Jamie Foxx and more. Kim Kardashian West, Selena Gomez and Ellen DeGeneres were among the celebs that took phone calls and jotted down donations. .

VTiger Woods has pleaded guilty to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion programme in order to avoid a DUI charge. The 41-year-old was arrested in May after he was found asleep in his car near his home in Jupiter Island, Florida. A toxicology report showed Woods had prescription drugs and marijuana in his system, but no alcohol. Woods issued a statement after his arrest, in which he apologised and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain following back surgery. Woods entered the guilty plea Friday in Palm Beach County, Florida, and he will spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. He also must attend DUI school, perform 20 hours of community service and attend a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged. Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo indicated that he had already met those requirements and also warned Woods about his future conduct. "This particular plea agreement has no jail time on it," said Bosso-Pardo. "However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and then I could sentence you to jail for 90 days with a fine of up to $500.". Tiger Woods was arrested in May after he was found asleep behind the wheel of his car. Woods has 79 PGA Tour victories and 14 major titles, which both rank number two all-time. However, having once been the dominant player in the world, Woods has been plagued by injuries over recent years, and has not won a major since 2008 or any tournament since August 2013. He has not competed since February because of a back injury and is not expected to return this year.

V REUTERS/Joshua Roberts. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez falsely claimed that the Electoral College is not \u201ca creation of the Constitution.\u201d. During a lecture at Indiana University Law School, Perez said the Electoral College \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be there,\u201d asserting that the national popular vote should be the principal standard. \u201cThe Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution. It doesn\u2019t have to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 270 electoral votes do the same.\u201d. Perez\u2019s claim that the Electoral College is not a part of the U.S. Constitution is completely false. Article II clearly outlines the electoral process, dictating that states must appoint electors who meet and vote for the president. . LISTEN:. \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector,\u201d Article II states. Perez has made statements in the past that President Donald Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t win\u201d the 2016 presidential election because former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.

V Bando Jonez - Stack It Up Feat. Migos . HNHH PREMIERE - Bando Jonez & Migos link up for a heater. We're pleased to premiere the latest banger from Bando Jonez and Migos, "Stack It Up." The Atlanta rapper slash singer has been killing it lately, and now, he's secured a track with the biggest group in the world right now. The crew made up of Offset, Quavo and Takeoff comes through to hold it down, with Polow Da Don putting in work behind the boards. Throw in some hilariously dope South Park inspired artwork for good measure, and "Stack It Up" is firing on all cylinders. . Bando spoke about linking up with Migos, and like many who have worked with the ATLiens, had nothing but praise for the group. "Ah man," begins Bando. "All three guys are talented. They got that turn up sound so it was only right my team got them on the record. They took the song and made it their own. When we heard their verses, I was like yeah man that's it! And you know Polow is a beast with producing...a genius I should say!". This marks the second Migos drop of the day, with the first being the Cardi B & Nicki Minaj assisted Culture 2 single "Motor Sport." Yet Bando's joint may actually go a bit harder, especially when the beat switches up around the 2:40 mark. In fact, it kind of makes you wish the entire track could have kept that same intensity, and Polow's production truly shines in that particular moment. Still, perhaps the brief switch-up makes you appreciate the moment even more. What do ya'll think about this latest drop from Bando Jonez? The Zone 4/Epic artist has already proven he can succeed with an RNB dominated vibe, and now, Jonez gets to flex his bars a little. If you're itching for more Migos, be sure to check out "Motor Sport" above. Quotable Lyrics. Now we got rich, you know that's a miracle. XXL they askin' for interviews. Trapper turned rapper so now I'm an artist. I run to the money but I am not Forrest.

VIt's practically impossible to find discounts on newly launched Apple phones. But imagine being charged more than even Apple's listed price on a new iPhone. You won't have to imagine that if you go shopping for an iPhone X at Best Buy. As first reported by Bloomberg, the retailer is offering the base 64GB iPhone X for $1,099.99 and the 256GB iPhone X for $1,249.99. In both cases, that's a full $100 over the Apple Store's price. . Overcharging for a popular product on its launch day isn't going to win many fans. In Bloomberg's report, a spokesperson for the retailer said its pricing offers customers flexibility. Here's the statement in full from Danielle Schumann, a company spokeswoman:. \u201cOur prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer\u2019s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy. Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.\u201d. To be fair, Best Buy only charges those prices if you pay for the phone in full. Buy the iPhone X in monthly installments from Best Buy, and you'll pay $41.63 per month over 24 months, which is in line with Verizon's monthly payment for an iPhone. Nevertheless, Best Buy is the only spot we've seen that's charging that much to buy the iPhone X outright, with many expecting the phone to sell out fast. . Best Buy expects to ship the iPhone X to customers by December 15. The Apple Store is also estimating a 5 to 6 week wait time for iPhone X deliveries. . On the positive side, the big-box retailer is currently in the midst of an excellent Apple sale with steep discounts on the 2017 MacBook Air ($250 off), Apple Watch Series 2 ($70 off), iPad Pro ($150 off), and iPad ($80 off). . To keep up on the latest legit iPhone X deals, be sure to follow updates we make to our deals story. .

VThe International Air Travel Association\u2019s (IATA), Thursday, presented a membership certificate to the Africa World Airlines (AWA), Ghana's fastest growing regional carrier. The symbolic presentation was done at the opening of the First Aerospace and Aviation Exhibition in West Africa. Mr. Raphael Kuuchi, Vice-President, Africa IATA, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency on the sidelines of the Africa Airshow, said one of the core objectives of the Association was to promote the value of Aviation. He said AWA joining the IATA family was a great achievement, not only for the Airline but also for Ghana. He said the Association has a lot of resources that member Airlines could leverage to grow their business and expand their network across the sub-region. "We will encourage AWA to take advantage of the Association's training resource to build their own capacity," he added. He said before an Airline becomes a member of IATA, it needs to pass the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), where the Airlines were provided with some capacity building to prepare. He said currently, the Association has 33 Airlines in Africa, on the IOSA's register, with 400 members globally. "We want to see more African Airlines joining IOSA," he added. He said Airlines on the IOSA register\u2019s safety record is seven times better than Airlines not on the register. Last year, Africa got a very impressive safety record, where the continent recorded zero air transport accidents. Mr. Richard Kyereh, Head, Commercial, AWA said: \u201cIt is a pride to be on the IATA register looking at the series of activities you go through to be on that register". He said \u201cwhen an Airline is listed on the register, they get more partnerships because other airlines build confidence in you and this will strengthen our collaboration with the bigger carriers,". Membership of IATA is optional. Members benefit in several ways, most importantly, IATA provides a powerful, unified and experienced voice that supports and promotes the interests of its members through international recognition and lobbying, targeting key industry priorities and driving industry change. The rest are reducing costs, communication campaigns, training and other services.

VThe iPhone X is now up for pre-order, and a lot of people seem to want to grab Apple's first $999 smartphone - shipping estimates have already slipped to 5-6 weeks at the moment, in fact. An interesting detail has been revealed by Apple today regarding the iPhone X, and it has to do with repair prices. The company published its flat-fee pricing for units that aren't covered by AppleCare+, and it turns out that if you know you're clumsy you probably shouldn't skip that. A screen-only repair of the iPhone X will set you back $279, while for other damage you will pay $549. For comparison, those numbers are $169 and $399 for the iPhone 8 Plus (which starts at $799), and $149 and $349 for the iPhone 8 (which starts at $699). So the repair pricing is pretty much in line with each handset's pricing. On the other hand, if you pay $199 for AppleCare+ on top of the $999 for your iPhone X, then you will only shell out $29 for a screen repair and $99 for anything else. All of these prices obviously only apply for the US, things may be wildly different in other parts of the world.

VPHOTO: Getty Images.  It feels like just yesterday that  Sephora's Weekly Wow promotion   came to us for the first time, bringing the sales that dreams are made of. For a place that used to have only one sale a year, we can't say we were expecting it\u2014it was a gift. And it was incredible while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end. From the beginning Sephora told us that the Weekly Wow sales would only run until November 1, which means this week's is our very last one. (We're just as bummed and hoping they'll decide to make it a permanent thing.) The single upside is, the Weekly Wows are going out with a bang, and this week's sale is the best product lineup yet. .  As per the Weekly Wow's custom, there's no official theme to the products. But look at this selection, and it really seems like the motif would be "best bone structure of your life," or, if you prefer, "get those angles." We've got not one but two contour palettes from sculpting heavyweights Anastasia Beverly Hills. Both its original powder  Contour Kit   and its  Contour Cream Kit   are now going for $20, down from $40. .  Leaning into Instagram makeup techniques, they're joined by  Stila's Correct & Perfect All-In-One Color Correcting Palette  . The palette is basically  Color Correcting for Dummies  ,   in the best way possible way\u2014the cream formula is sheer but buildable, while the powders set everything with an added dose of brightness. If you never got into contouring or color correcting and aren't about to start, prepare yourself; our eyes bugged out when we saw this one. Becca's best-selling  Shimmering Skin Perfector Poured Crème Highlighter  , one of the easiest, prettiest highlighters on the market, is marked down to $19, down from its original $38. .  Loading . View on Instagram.  Unless you're diehard passionate about makeup, brushes are usually the hardest sell. But at $20 for a  Sephora Collection set   of face makeup brushes, typically $40, it's intriguing (and the price breaks down to $10 per brush, which is  very   persuasive). Philosophy's  The Microdelivery Resurfacing Peel   rounds out the bunch, a two-step exfoliating treatment that would likely nullify the need for color correcting. That is a choice you must make. Good luck. .

VAccording to organisers, Rwanda Automobile Club (RAC), the two-day event is part of the National Rally Championship held in memory of the late Claude Gakwaya, one of the best Rwandan rally drivers, who passed away in a motor accident in 1986. "All is set for the rally, everything will go as planned. We are ready to have a smooth event," said Eric Gakwaya, the event organizer. Gakwaya added that this year's rally will be special and more interesting because it will also include the popular Motocross Freestyle race which will feature riders from South Africa. 14 crews from regional countries are expected to compete in the race. They include five from Rwanda, six from Uganda, and three from Burundi. Drivers will compete in competitive sections through Rango, Gisagara and Rwasave before returning to Huye town where they will race three times. In the afternoon, the event will shift to Huye Stadium where the motor cross race will take place at night. Two South African riders as well as eight local Motocross riders will compete in the freestyle category and the first day of event will cover a total of 125km. On the last day of the rally (Sunday) the drivers will start from Save-Rango to Shyanda where they will race four times before the closing ceremony. Roshanali and Jean Jeans Giesen are the reigning champions of the rally.

VEdinson Cavani scored for PSG. Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain made light of the absence of world-record signing Neymar as they coasted to a 3-0 victory over Nice. The Brazil international was serving a suspension for his sending off last weekend, but it mattered little to his team as Edinson Cavani took centre stage. Uruguay international Cavani scored twice, taking his tally to 64 goals in his last 63 matches for the club, with Dante's own goal denying Dani Alves his first league strike since arriving from Juventus in the summer and putting the game beyond the visitors after just 50 minutes. PSG were also without the injured Thiago Motta and Thomas Meunier but such is the strength and depth of their squad that barely warranted a mention such was the comfortable margin of victory. All the talk was about Cavani who stole the show as he flourished in the absence of Neymar. Cavani scored with PSG's first attempt on target in only the third minute, diving in at the near post to head home Angel Di Maria's low free-kick from the left. Cavani could have doubled the lead midway through the half but was denied by Walter Benitez from Julian Draxler's pass. He was not to be denied for long, however, as just past the half-hour the 31-year-old timed his run to perfection to latch onto Di Maria's reverse pass over the top, toe poke past the on-rushing Benitez and roll the ball into an empty net. Playing with confidence - helped by a record which has seen them suffer just one Ligue 1 home defeat in the last three-and-a-half years - it was virtually one-way traffic. PSG's third and final goal came five minutes after the interval and, in keeping with the rest of the evening, Cavani had a hand in that. The Uruguayan headed Yuri Berchiche's cross back into the six-yard area where Alves, who had been denied in the first half by Benitez, challenged with Dante with the Nice defender appearing to get the final touch from close range. There was no way back for Nice, who could find themselves in the bottom three if results go against them at the weekend, with the width of a post preventing Kylian Mbappe making it 4-0. The win extended PSG's advantage over Monaco, who travel to Bordeaux on Saturday, to seven points.

VTHE SUPREME Court has issued separate arrest warrants to the police administration for the arrest of four suspected armed robbers. The suspects are 32-year-old Richard; 30-year-old Ofei, Mustapha and Oboye. Richard is a native of Aburi; Ofei is from Mampong-Akwapim; Oboye hails from Dahwenya and Mustapha comes from Ashaiman, the warrants indicated. Ofei is said to be 5.4 inches tall and fair in complexion. According to the warrants, the suspects are believed to be hiding at Ashaiman, Tema, Accra or Aflao, in the Greater Accra and the Volta regions respectively. The accused persons allegedly hired the service of a taxi driver, Emmanuel Kisseh Agovor, by 2:00 am on July 7, 2017, from Ashaiman to Ashongman Estates, in Accra. According to the facts of the matter, the accused persons, armed with AK 47 rifles, broke into the complainant's house and made away with a Dell laptop, two Samsung Edge mobile phones (5 and 7), DVR for CCTV and Mossberg pump action gun, all valued at GH¢20,000. \u201cThe police upon a tip-off, rushed to the crime scene but the accused persons \u2013 Richard, Oboye, Ofei and Mustapha \u2013 had absconded and are still at large. Some photographs were however, obtained during investigations,\u201d the police administration indicated. The complainant in the case, according to a Police Fact Sheet, is Stephen Teye Martey, a resident of Ashongman Estates. The suspects are required to be produced before the court upon their arrests. The police administration has therefore urged members of the public to assist with information to help arrest the suspects. \u201cAnybody with information should kindly contact the nearest police station. Hotlines: 18555 & 191; other: 0243382836,\u201d the police said.

Breaking the financial statement for September in Yenagoa, Jonah said the state had realised abhout N1.3 as IGR in August. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Bayelsa had collected N868.58 million in the previous month.

VImage credit: Carl Court/Getty. Whatsapp users with fingers moving faster than their brain will be happy to know the company\u2019s rolling out a new feature that lets you retract that last message, and wipe it from the conversation. Right now the feature is rolling out to certain users, according to The Next Web. According to WhatsApp\u2019s FAQ page, the anticipated delete feature allows you to expunge that autocorrect fail or message sent to the wrong person from the record. Everyone, whether chatting to one person or to a group, will see \u201cThis message was deleted\u201d in lieu of your earlier message. You\u2019ve only got seven minutes to strike your flub from the conversation, however. After that, you\u2019re out of luck. . To ensure you\u2019re one of the lucky users who can delete messages, you\u2019ll have to make sure you\u2019re using an updated version of the app on your iOS, Android, or (ha!) Windows Phone (again, ha!) device. Your chat recipient (or recipients) also need to update WhatsApp to its latest version. After updating, you can check if you have the feature by selecting a message under seven minutes old. iOS users will press and hold on the message, select the Delete option, and then Delete for everyone if it\u2019s available. Android and Windows Phone users can select one or multiple messages, select the Delete option, and then pick Delete for everyone. Minor improvements do need to be made before you rely on the chat-based undo button. Recipients can see your message before you delete it, and there\u2019s no way to verify whether or not a message was successfully deleted from everyone\u2019s conversation. Still, if you\u2019re a few drinks in and want to retract the romantic advance that was sent to your tailor instead of your Tinder date, the undo button could be a life-saver.

VIn 2013, the judge had told a 19-year-old victim who had had her breasts grabbed by a telecom technician at home that it was not the "crime of the century" - Representational image. A Canadian judge's remark on the sexual assault victim's weight and her presumed consent has dragged him under fire. Quebec court Judge Jean-Paul Braun had said, "You could say she's a little overweight, but she has a pretty face, huh?" during the May trial, which was first reported by The Journal de Montreal newspaper. He had also stated that the 17-year-old girl was a "little flattered" by the attention she received from her alleged assailant. Provincial Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée filed a complaint against Braun after finding his remarks unacceptable, The BBC reported. According to reports, the teen victim has testified against a taxi driver for assaulting her while she was a passenger in his vehicle. In her testimony, the girl said that Carlo Figaro had tried to kiss her, licked her face and groped her after she boarded his vehicle. But the judge went out of context during the trial, according to a recording obtained by the Journal de Montreal and commented on the victim's weight and appearance. He also talked about the several degrees of the consent required to kiss someone. "I conclude that he tried to kiss her, that can be an acceptable gesture," Braun said. The judge in question also suggested that the girl might have been flattered by the attention she got from the accused as "it was perhaps the first time that he was interested in her". However, eventually the 49-year-old Figaro was found guilty of the assault. He is now appealing the verdict. This is not the first time Braun has come under scrutiny for his remarks. In 2013, he had told a 19-year -old victim who had had her breasts grabbed by a telecom technician at home that it was not the "crime of the century". "This judge clearly lacks information on the problem. It would be important for him to revisit the concept of consent," Sophie Charpentier, a social worker, said. Meanwhile, the Judicial Council has refused to comment on the complaints. It said they review complaints before determining whether to launch an investigation. If necessary an inquiry committee decides on possible sanctions.

VThe average age of a first-time driver is about 16-years-old. Your first few times behind the wheel are with an instructor who has just enough control of the vehicle to prevent accidents. After a certain amount of sessions, you\u2019re ready to pass a driving test \u2014 and even after that, you\u2019re not prepared enough to drive on busy roads all by yourself. But one 11-year-old boy got a little test of the road very early, and without proper supervision. In the boy\u2019s defense, it wasn\u2019t his fault that he found himself behind the wheel \u2014 it was his uncle\u2019s. Cops pulled over an erratic Honda after other drivers called 911 about the driver. The boy was in the driver\u2019s seat, sitting on a pile of clothes, which was necessary for him to see over the wheel. Next to him was his intoxicated uncle, 29-year-old Genoro Lopez. Cops asked the child why he was driving, and he answered that he was learning. Then he revealed the truth: his uncle wanted to avoid a DUI, so he got the pre-teen behind the wheel instead. But that wasn\u2019t the only crime Genoro was guilty of: he also didn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license. The man was arrested and charged with felony child endangerment and for having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. More Stories from LittleThings.

V The 27-year-old has been rewarded for his stellar performances for the Blue and Whites all year round in an elaborate ceremony at the Dragao . Yacine Brahimi has been named 2017 Porto player of the year. The Algeria international joined the Dragons from Granada in the summer of 2014 and has gone on to make 125 appearances for the club while scoring 32 goals in the process. And the former Rennes winger who was instrumental as the Estadio do Dragao outfit finished as runners-up in the 2016/17 Portuguese Primeira Liga season and qualified for the Uefa Champions League was voted the Blue and Whites best player of the year 2017. And the 27-year-old who has already scored three goals in the Portuguese top flight already this season to help his side open up a two-point gap at the top of the log thanked manager Sergio Conceicao and insists the club is desperate to end their four-year trophy drought. "Now I have a manager[Sérgio Conceição] that gives me confidence, not the other way around like last year[Nuno E. Santo]," Brahimi said during the ceremony. "For four years we haven't won anything. The most important for me this season is to win the Liga.\u201d.  Article continues below . \U0001f535\u26aa\U0001f409 .

VChief Jude Emecheta, the Managing Director of Anambra Signage and Advertising Agency, has blamed top officials of political parties and their supporters for the reported cases of destruction of campaign posters. Emecheta told the News Agency of Nigeria in Awka on Thursday that the agency officials were not responsible for the destruction of billboards ahead of the November 18 governorship election in the state. NAN reports some political parties in the state had complained and petitioned the agency for the destruction of their campaign materials by unknown persons after they had paid signage fees. The All Progressives Congress had described the act as a mark of rascality and called on ANSAA and the state government to check the ugly trend. NAN reports that in a statement by Chidi Adirika, the Media and ICT Directorate of Tony Nwoye\u2019s Campaign Organisation, the APC said the growing onslaught on opposition materials was condemnable. Adirika said: \u201cIt is bad enough that the state government imposed unreasonable levies on any candidate who wished to mount campaign billboards or paste posters. \u201cYet it sends out its hoodlums to single out all billboards and posters belonging to Dr. Tony Nwoye for destruction.\u201d. The party urged its members not to engage in any form reprisal and pleaded for issue-based politics. Responding, Emecheta blamed political brigandage and politics of bad blood for the alleged destruction of billboards and posters of candidates. He said there had been some level of compliance from APC and PDP in terms of payment while acknowledging that there had been complaints of poster war in the state. Emecheta said: \u201cANSAA officials do not pull down billboards, anybody who complied with the rules is not supposed to have problems unless it is in areas that is not permitted by the payment they made. \u201cIt is as a result of brigandage among these politicians, not just the opposition, even APGA billboards are also pull down. \u201cUnfortunately, some of these people in campaign directorates are comfortable with what is happening, they must condemn it and tell their supporters to stop it. \u201cBy way of pleading with these politicians, I want to say that Anambra belongs to us all and will remain with us after election, they should purge themselves of this bad blood politics. \u201cIf we destroy everything we have for this election, we will have to repair them later.\u201d. Emecheta said ANSAA had constituted a monitoring team with the Police to protect signage property in the state, warning that culprits would be made to face the law. NAN.

VAustralian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce reacts as he sits in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra. Australia's High Court has ruled Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce will no longer be eligible to sit in the parliament as he held dual citizenship during the election, putting the ruling government's majority at risk. Joyce was among five lawmakers disqualified by the court on Friday, 27 October. Citing the Australian constitution, which prohibits dual citizens from being elected, the High Court in Canberra ruled fresh by-election needs to be held for Joyce's seat. Joyce held a New Zealand citizenship at the time of elections but renounced it in August so he will be allowed to contest in the upcoming by-election. The court ruling means Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's coalition, which holds a one-seat majority in the lower house, will be at risk forcing the premier to seek support from independent lawmakers. "I'm not going to participate in it. I will concentrate on the people of New England. That is exactly what I was doing today. I will be talking to people in the streets, the supermarkets, the sale-yards, and making sure that service to them and my nation remains foremost in my mind," said Joyce, who argued he was unaware of his New Zealand citizenship before the elections, after the court's outcome. Joyce, born Australian, had citizenship in New Zealand through his father. "I respect the verdict of the court. We live in a marvellous democracy, with all the checks and balances they have given us all the freedoms we see. I thank the court [for] their deliberations," added the disqualified deputy prime minister. By-election for Joyce's seat is expected to take place on 2 December. Two other senators who were also under the scrutiny were allowed to keep their seats in the ruling.

V press release . Swift response by the police prevented Cash-In-Transit Robbery at Fordsburg, Johannesburg, on Friday 27 October 2017. South African Police Service Members responded to a cash-in-transit robbery in progress. As the police were approaching, suspects who were allegedly carrying boxes containing cash that they robbed from G4S members, started shooting at the police. There was an exchange of fire between the police and the suspects. Suspects on realising that they were cornered, allegedly dropped the boxes before getting into the getaway cars and drove off. One police officer was shot in the arm and one member of the community was also injured and taken to hospital for medical treatment. It is also suspected that the alleged robbers were also wounded during the shootout. Police have since launched a manhunt for approximately eight suspects who were driving in a dark grey Almeria sedan and white VW Jetta 6.

VIt feels unreal, but it's really happening. The iPhone X is now available for pre-order. . After years of constant rumors \u2014 intensified at the very last moment as it became uncertain whether the iPhone X will have a Touch ID or not \u2014 Apple's radically redesigned iPhone can actually be bought, starting at $999. . You still can't have it, though \u2014 it should start arriving in a few weeks. Or you can try to get one around Nov. 3, when it hits Apple's retail stores. Stores are a bit of a gamble, but with a pre-order, you'll at least make sure you'll get a unit in a reasonable amount of time. But you should probably hurry, as rumors say the supply will be extremely limited at first. . Interestingly, very shortly after the start of pre-orders, Apple's online store went offline, but it returned within roughly half an hour. . At the time of writing, there still appears to be plenty of availability. All available combinations \u2014 64GB and the 256GB, Silver and Space Gray colors \u2014 ship in 2-3 weeks. . We've also checked the UK Apple Store, where the situation is a little bit worse; all variants ship in 4-5 weeks. . The iPhone X sports an all new design, with a huge 5.8-inch display that covers nearly the entire front side of the device. It has Apple's new A11 Bionic chip, a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back, a 7-megapixel True-Depth camera on the front with Portrait mode, and Apple's all Face ID, a new way to unlock your phone by simply looking at it. .

VChelsea manager Antonio Conte has attacked rumours that his Premier League title champions have turned against him season. UK newspaper The Sun had reported that players had been texting former Chelsea No.2 Steve Holland to suggest that they no longer had a healthy relationship with Conte, although the story has been been pulled from its website. Holland left his role in the summer to be England assistant coach working under Gareth Southgate and reports had claimed that Chelsea players felt overworked in training in 2017-18. The same newspaper also claimed that former coach Carlo Ancelotti, fresh from being sacked by Bayern Munich, has been tapped up to replace fellow Italian coach Conte. "I think there is a lot of bullshit [rumours]," Conte told reporters ahead of Chelsea's clash with Bournemouth on Saturday. "They [The Sun] try to create problems for me and the players.". Chelsea have not started the season in the same ascension as they showed last season, with defeats to Burnley and Crystal Palace contributing to them being nine points adrift of leaders Manchester City. However, back-to-back victories over Watford and Everton in the league and Carabao Cup respectively in the last week will have settled nerves at Stamford Bridge.  Article continues below . The absence of last season's PFA Player of the Year winner, N'Golo Kante, through injury has been keenly felt and Conte ruled him out of this weekend's clash on Friday. "N'Golo is still not ready, we have to wait and I hope to have him back for the Roma game," he said.

VA planned demonstration organised by Mathare MP Antony Oluoch against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko flopped on Friday morning. . The NASA MP who was roughed up on Thursday evening at Panafric Hotel by Jubilee supporters was briefly hospitalized for checkup Thursday night and he immediately blamed Sonko for the incident although Sonko was in Machakos County during the incident. . There was drama at the Hotel on Thursday evening after some NASA allied politicians stormed and disrupted a Jubilee Party press conference. . The team, led by Oluoch and Kibera MP Ken Okoth, were angered by statements made Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen that they (NASA politicians) were waiting for him to pay for their \u201ctea\u201d at the Panafric Hotel. Just after the opposition MPs had retreated after addressing a press conference at the Hotel and normalcy was returning, a group of youths came from nowhere and descended on Oluoch with kicks and blows and he was saved by the hotel\u2019s security agents and Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja. The jubilee MPs left the facility and later addressed another press conference at Serena Hotel where they condemned the incident, saying the opposition MPs were just interested in drama. Here are some of the photos from Mathare showing how residents boycotted Oluoch\u2019s anti-Sonko protest.  .  .  . Here is the media invite sent to media houses Friday morning prior to the flopped protests. Hello . Good morning . This is to inform you that the people of Mathare will this morning stage a peaceful demonstration against Nairobi Governor Hon. Sonko against his incitement that led to attack against Mathare member of parliament Hon. Oluoch. Please be present to air our official petition.

VThe Senior Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has said the President will, in the next few days, take a decision about the controversial reinstatement of a former chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Pension Reforms, Abdulrasheed Maina. Shehu said this Thursday night when he appeared on Channel TV\u2019s Politics Today anchored by Seun Okinbaloye. According to him, President Buhari has received all the reports he requested for, to enable him take a decision but had to restrain himself from making pronouncements too early because other arms and agencies of government were currently investigating the matter and more revelations were made as well. He however assured Nigerians that the President will take a stand soon. Shehu said: \u201cAs we said in that statement (on Maina\u2019s reinstatement), this is a mess we inherited; the Maina Saga \u2013 the bribery and the sharing. N24 billion (was what) he took over on the day he took that office. When he left, (there was) one million naira left. So, it happened under the watch of the previous administration and that is why we said, morally, they have no right to accuse us. \u201cWhat is the Buhari government doing? The President has got all the reports, he is going to take a decision, but this issue is a big one. It\u2019s expanding and we welcome investigation by anyone \u2013 the Senate, the House of Representatives. \u201cNow Maina is back home, he is going to have his day in court. \u201cPeople just sat down and were receiving cash from that man, knowing full well that it was the police pension that he was sharing. People who ought to investigate him, who ought to send him to trial, are beneficiaries of that heist. \u201cIn the coming days, the President will decide and all of these things will come out.\u201d.

VIndia is now the world's second largest smartphone market, behind China. That pushes the U.S. down to third spot for the first time. According to Canalys data, India shipped 40 million phones in the third quarter of this year, 23 percent higher than the same period in 2016. That momentum was responsible for propelling India past the U.S. China overtook the U.S. in 2011 to become the world's largest. Canalys analyst Rushabh Doshi said India has been working to improve its network coverage, and as more people get reliable 4G access, that's helped push demand for mobile devices too. India, the second most populous country in the world, with 1.3 billion people, is on track to have just under 300 million smartphone users in the country by year end. Xiaomi is having a spectacular year in India. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the vendors winning India are premium Android makers with affordable models. Samsung and Xiaomi in particular, are neck-to-neck, with Xiaomi rocketing past Lenovo (last year's second place) to put up a close fight with Samsung. Samsung, which shipped about 7 million phones in India's 2016 third quarter, pushed that number to 9.4 million this year to keep the lead. But most impressively, Xiaomi, which had under 3 million phones sold in Q3 last year, tripled that figure this year to hit 9.2 million smartphones. Looking at the chart's green bars below, you can see that everyone else is pretty much left in the dust. Earlier this year, the Indian government was pushing for really budget smartphones of lower than $30, in hopes that this would push mobile adoption \u2014 and consequently mobile e-payment \u2014 in the country. But from the top five vendor list, it's clear that everyone wants premium smartphones, even if they aren't buying the top-of-the-line flagships. Xiaomi, for its part, has aggressively courted India as its main focus outside its home market of China. In May, it started opening brick and mortar stores in Bangalore, indicating it was confident of brand awareness in the country.

VNouakchott \u2014 The 8 th conference of the Heads of Supreme Courts of Arab States has concluded activities in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott. The Sudan has participated in the conference with a delegation led by the Chief Justice, Prof. Hayder Ahmed Dafulla, and the head of the National Supreme Court. The conference has asserted in its recommendations keenness of the heads of the Arab Supreme Courts to develop the judicial system, the good progress of the courts work in the Arab countries, and their determination to enhance the coordination mechanisms and develop means of cooperation among them. The conference has also stressed the effective role of the Supreme Courts in their automatic intervention in matters of public order in the civil and criminal law, calling for the legalization of the conditions and deadlines of the proceedings after the referral from the Supreme Court, taking into account the procedural specialties of each country to speed up the settling of disputes, activate the appeal in favor of the law, the restriction of its conditions to contribute to the promotion of the law and work for the spread of the principles and jurisprudence issued by the Supreme Courts in the Arab countries, and exchange and circulate them by all possible means.

VSuspected armed robbers on Friday intercepted and killed five people including a prominent PDP politician in Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulhadi Saidu Garkuwan Yanware. Then gunmen believed to be armed robbers mounted a road block along Funtua \u2013 Gusau road shooting from far range upcoming vehicles. They stopped and killed people onboard Canter vehicle before dispossessing them of their belongings. A resident Alhaji Saidu Maishanu Gusau told Daily Trust that the PDP chieftain was shot on the neck after their vehicle ran in to the road block mounted by the gunmen. They opened fire on the vehicle conveying the PDP chieftain. \u201cThey were coming back from Kaduna state where they held a meeting unknown to them that the gunmen were lurking around the area. The driver of their vehicle survived the attack but is currently receiving treatment at a medical facility in Tsafe local government area of the state,\u201d he added.

V'Tis the season... to be scalping!. Just hours after Apple's iPhone X went up for pre-order around the world, some asshole has already listed the hard-to-get-your-hands-on "all-screen" device for a whopping $59,999 on eBay. Screw this guy. But also screw anyone who's stupid and desperate enough to buy it from him. Look, I take no joy in calling anyone an asshole, but when you're scalping an iPhone X at a 5,117 percent mark up. Screw you, man. I understand that it's simple supply and demand, and some of these sellers are legitimately just trying to make a living, and it's just simple business. . But seriously, what the hell, man? . The device up for sale is a 256GB model that sells for $1,150. Don't be that idiot who pays this ridiculous price. It's not worth it. Need another reason? The seller can't even guarantee you'll get the iPhone X on launch day on Nov. 3. Estimated delivery time is between Oct. 30 (impossible unless they get it early somehow) and Nov. 13. Worse, the screenshot of the pre-ordered iPhone X shows a delivery date of Nov. 17-24. . Screw that. On that note, don't pay markup prices at all from anywhere. You're better than that. Don't fall for it. It's just a new iPhone. Relax and breathe. It's not the end of the world if you don't have one. And if anyone, like your significant other tells you otherwise, dump their ass.

VIn light of the numerous accusations of sexual harassment and assault against producer Harvey Weinstein, Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem are speaking out, and they are not mincing words. The duo made an appearance on the MSNBC show All in with Chris Hayes to discuss the allegations\u2014and they held nothing back. \u201cIt feels like something has shifted,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that it\u2019s probably because so many of the women that were [allegedly] assaulted by Harvey Weinstein are famous and white and everybody knows them. This has been going on a long time to black women and other women of color and it doesn\u2019t get out quite the same.\u201d. Her spotlight on the factors of fame and race in public awareness and media coverage comes after Lupita Nyong'o\u2014one of the few women of color to have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct\u2014opened up about uncomfortable experiences with the producer in a New York Times op-ed. Through a rep, Weinstein issued his only response that directly named an actress and specifically disputed her claim: \u201cMr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry. Last year, she sent a personal invitation to Mr. Weinstein to see her in her Broadway show Eclipsed.\u201d. Weinstein also denied all claims of sexual assault in a separate statement through a representative: \u201cAny allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\u201d. Fonda and Steinem were on the show specifically as representatives and spokespeople for The Women's Media Center, which they co-founded back in 2005 with poet Robin Morgan. Steinem gave her own thoughts about the Weinstein scandal, citing bias as a reason why accusers weren't believed until they came out in masses. \u201cIf you steal money, you probably get arrested and convicted, because everybody says stealing is wrong. But if you do something that is very sexist or racist, because there still is a critical mass of bias in this country, it takes more cumulative instances for it to be recognized,\u201d Steinem said. \u201cSo we have reached a tipping point I think.\u201d. We certainly hope so. Watch their appearance in the video above.

VWhile at one time the very idea seemed to promise the possibility of a digitally connected utopia, these days the Internet of Things is mostly notable for simultaneously being both a punchline and a threat to the very core of the internet. However, at least part of that may change \u2014 maybe \u2014 if two U.S. Congressmen have their way. . On Friday, Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) proposed a bill that aims to establish a standardized system for evaluating and certifying the security of IoT products. With so many manufacturers of internet-connected cameras and toasters ignoring basic best practices, this measure would allow a concerned customer to sort the wheat from the botnet-infected chaff. . Think something along the lines of a "certified organic" sticker, but instead of telling you pesticides weren't used on your carrots, you get to see that your smart fridge is less likely to be taken over by the Mirai botnet or its kin. . "The Secretary shall establish a voluntary program to identify and certify covered products with superior cybersecurity and data security through voluntary certification and labeling of, and other forms of communication about, covered products and subsets of covered products that meet industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks to enhance cybersecurity and protect data," reads the bill. "[The Secretary] shall permit a manufacturer or distributor of a covered product to display a Cyber Shield label reflecting the extent to which the product meets the industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks established under paragraph.". It is time we start acting like we are in the 21st Century. https://t.co/lyj23GZNpC. \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) October 27, 2017. "The IoT will also stand for the Internet of Threats unless we put in place appropriate cybersecurity safeguards,\u201d explained Senator Markey in a press release. \u201cWith as many as 50 billion IoT devices projected to be in our pockets and homes by 2020, cybersecurity will continue to pose a direct threat to economic prosperity, privacy, and our nation\u2019s security. By creating a cybersecurity certification program, the Cyber Shield Act will help ensure consumers can reliably identify more secure products and rewards manufacturers that adopt the best cybersecurity practices." . That someone in the government is even thinking about this problem represents a positive change. However, a voluntary labeling program is not the same thing as mandating that internet-connected device manufacturers (among other things) stop using default admin passwords for their gadgets. . Until that day comes, IoT devices will always be a risk to the online ecosystem. But hey, you have to start somewhere. .

VThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the setting up of Road Trust Fund (RTF) for the country. The decision is part of government\u2019s deliberate strategy for a tax relief scheme that would attract private sector involvement in the provision of Federal road infrastructure. Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, who disclosed this while briefing State House Correspondents after the FEC meeting, said that the concept was jointly developed by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing. The RTF is expected to mobilise significant capital into road provision in order to unlock socio-economic development as well as facilitate investment across all areas of Nigeria to achieve inclusive economic growth. According to the Finance Minister, Federal roads carry more than 80 per cent of national vehicular and freight traffic, accounting for 17 per cent of the total national road network. The Minister explained that the RTF would facilitate and incentivise private sector involvement in Nigeria\u2019s Federal road infrastructure. Adeosun said:\u201cIt is a form of Public Private Partnership that will accelerate the provision of Federal Roads by allowing private sector operators to collectively fund road provision in exchange for tax credits. This will complement Federal Government\u2019s budgetary allocation to roads. \u201cPrivate sector participation is being incentivised through a Tax Credit Scheme that enables all participating companies to claim tax relief based on the amount of capital contribution (on a pro-rata basis). \u201cWe have already consulted with the private sector in the development of the RTF and some companies have already identified roads they wish to reconstruct and are organising their funding. However, this scheme is designed such that Financial intermediaries will be promoting Road Trust Fund projects and soliciting commitments from interested companies,\u201d he said.

V @migos announce at #PowerhouseNYC that @iamcardib and @nickiminaj are going to be on #culture2 and played part of their new song \u201cmotorsport\u201d \U0001f61b\U0001f61b. A post shared by Power 105.1 (@power1051) on Oct 26, 2017 at 8:17pm PDT. It looks like we get to hear the two reigning queens of hip-hop on a song together sooner than expected. At New York\u2019s Power 105.1 Powerhouse, Migos took a moment during their set to bring Offset\u2019s lady love Cardi B onstage and preview their upcoming collaboration with her and Nicki Minaj entitled \u201cMotor Sport\u201d to boisterous applause from the massive crowd. Apparently, the new song will be on Culture 2, which is hopefully coming soon since it turns out Quavo actually didn\u2019t lose the hard drive with the files on it. Migos are playing a pretty important role in Cardi B and Nicki breaking a huge stigma in rap. It\u2019s been quite some time since the top female rappers in hip-hop have collaborated rather than being pitted against each other. Nicki and Cardi\u2019s willingness to work together also directly defies their own fans\u2019 expectations; when Cardi first started acquiring a tremendous buzz for \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and racking up guest features all over the place, some fans deemed her a threat to Nicki\u2019s continued supremacy. However, it wasn\u2019t long before Cardi had laid those suspicions to rest, paving the way for \u201cMotor Sport.\u201d. Shortly after the preview went up on Power\u2019s Instagram, Motown Records released a looped-up streaming preview of their own, a la Republic Records\u2019 Youtube release of Post Malone\u2019s \u201cRockstar,\u201d which has been credited with the song\u2019s tremendous success. Check it out below.

V press release . In a concerted effort by the police to fight serious and violent crimes including murders throughout this Province, the SAPS Detectives Operational Wing continue to acquire lengthy jail terms from various courts through their dedicated and professional investigative skills. The Polokwane High Court has today given lengthy sentences to three men, aged between 24 and 26 years, for murder, attempted murder and robbery. Hlakodiso Pleasure Kekana (24), Thakgatso Kopano Mphafudi (25) and Paballo Clement Mangwale (26) were each sentenced to life imprisonment plus an additional 15 years imprisonment for killing Sahel Rana (39), attempting to kill another person and robbing them valuable items and cash. On the 24 March 2017, three men armed with pangas, scissors and empty bottles, stormed into Matsepeng shop at Mamaolo village near Lebowakgomo outside Polokwane, attacked and hacked Sahel Rana to death and further attacked another victim who survived. Afterwards, they fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash and goods. The Police were notified and started with their initial investigations leading to arrest of these suspects within four days. The Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has commended the Lebowakgomo Detectives on a job well done. "All criminals out there must know that if they continue to try their luck in terrorising the business communities, we are going to deal with them and remove them indefinitely from our society," concluded Lieutenant General Ledwaba.

V GOP tax plan remains on track, Amazon shakes the healthcare industry, and third-quarter GDP data due. . Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. Tax plan. Yesterday\u2019s successful adoption of budget resolution by the House means the path to passing a tax-reform bill remains open, if still difficult. One of the main difficulties for lawmakers continues to be finding out what is actually in the plan before its release on Nov. 1. This has done nothing to dampen the ambitious schedule to get that plan into law, with Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn saying the bill would have to be out of the Senate by Thanksgiving. US stocks rallied yesterday on renewed hopes for successful tax reform. . Next target. Amazon.com shares rose as much as 8.5%, topping $1 000, in extended trading yesterday after announcing results that beat analyst estimates. While this made for a good day for company founder Jeff Bezos who added $6.6 billion to his personal fortune, it wasn\u2019t a cause for celebration everywhere. The prospect of the retail giant entering the healthcare industry following a report that it had received pharmacy-wholesale licences in a dozen states triggered a steep selloff among suppliers. Established players in the sector seem to be looking at defensive moves, with CVS Health Corporation reportedly in talks to buy insurer Aetna. . GDP. Economists are estimating that hurricane damage to third-quarter US GDP may be less than originally expected, with the median estimate for a 2.6% annualised expansion in the period. The data is due to be released by the Commerce Department at 8:30 am eastern time. Should the growth rate come in close to expectations, it would give the US the strongest back-to-back prints since 2015, following the second-quarter\u2019s 3.1% annualised growth. . Markets rise. Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.3%, while Japan\u2019s Topix index added 1.0% as the yen weakened against the dollar. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.5% higher at 5:55 am as positive earnings added to yesterday\u2019s ECB-policy boost. S&P 500 futures were 0.3% higher, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.452% and gold was lower. . Big oil . Yesterday was tech, today it\u2019s big oil\u2019s turn to dominate earnings. Already, Total SA posted the highest earnings from pumping oil and gas in more than two years. The largest US oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation are due to announce results pre-market. In trading, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate for December delivery was at $52.56 by 5:55 am. © 2017 Bloomberg.

VUFC President Dana White responded Thursday to the man who filed a lawsuit against middleweight champion Michael Bisping over an alleged assault at a gym in Anaheim, California. . "I'm sure it's that typical f--king p---y who opens his mouth at the f--king gym, and then Bisping goes over and\u2014I don't know what Bisping did to him, but now he wants to f--king sue Bisping\u2014should have shut your f--king face in the first place," White said on the RQMS Podcast (warning: post contains profanity). . "You're a clown. Guys like that are a f--king embarrassment.". TMZ Sports first reported Tuesday that Bisping was being sued by Antonio Georgakopoulos, who alleged that he was involved in a verbal and physical altercation with the fighter after he took his weights at the gym without asking. . Citing a copy of the lawsuit, TMZ reported Georgakopoulos alleged that Bisping "grabbed him by the throat and began to squeeze\u2014cutting off oxygen.". TMZ later spoke to the Anaheim Police Department and confirmed Bisping was not arrested and that the City Attorney's Office opted not to press charges due to a lack of evidence. . "Total bollocks," Bisping said of the allegations Thursday, according to MMA Fighting's Marc Raimondi. "There's your comment.". Bisping, 38, will headline UFC 217 on Nov. 4 when he puts his middleweight belt on the line against Georges St-Pierre. .

VApple Inc quashed any concern of muted demand for its iPhone X on Friday, saying pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were "off the charts". The company's shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response. Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday. "We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts," an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters. "We\u2019re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.". The company's website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3. IPhone X's launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones. Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID. Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone's $999 price tag could weigh on demand. Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. He noted that Sprint Corp\u2019s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year\u2019s launch of the iPhone 7. Shares of Apple were up 2.9 percent at $161.96 in morning trading in New York. (Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty).

V The Spanish PM asked citizens to "stay calm", ahead of Madrid deciding whether to impose direct rule on the region. . Catalonia's parliament voted to declare independence from Spain on Friday, shortly before Madrid was set to impose direct rule on the region. The regional parliament voted to leave Spain after weeks of uncertainty between Madrid and Barcelona. The move was backed 70 to 10, with two opposition members sitting out the vote, in the 135 seat chamber. "We hereby constitute the Catalan Republic as an independent, sovereign, legal, democratic, socially-conscious state", says the declaration.   Fri Oct 27 13:30:45 UTC+0000 2017  . Shortly after the declaration, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy issued a brief statement: "I ask all Spaniards to stay calm. The State will restore legality in Catalonia.". Madrid is set to vote later on Friday on whether to impose Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which would allow the government to use "all measures necessary" to restore order. If Article 155 is invoked, the Spanish capital would be able to hire and fire Catalan politicians, emergency service leaders, and would take control of the region's finances.   Albert Gea / Reuters  . Catalan lawmakers applaud after the Parliament declared independence. Earlier Friday, Rajoy told politicians in Madrid that the region needed direct rule in order to restore "law, democracy, and stability". However, the ultimate decision rests in the hands of Spain's senate, which is due to vote on the issue shortly. Prior to the vote, the PM accused Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont of dividing Spanish families, threatening stability, and causing businesses to suffer due to the uncertainty. "The thing that Catalans need protecting from is not what they're calling Spanish imperialism, but a minority who, in an intolerant way, declare themselves the owners of Catalonia and consider as exclusive a history, culture and feelings that are the heritage of the community," Rajoy told the Spanish senate earlier. Video shared on social media showed hundreds of people in Barcelona taking to the streets to celebrate the decision by parliament. Huge emotions outside #Catalonia parliament as pro-independence protestors watch the parliamentary debate on huge s\u2026 https://t.co/vHMn1cW4k9.   01:54 PM - 27 Oct 2017  . Last month, thousands voted in a contested referendum asking for independence. The regional government claimed that 90% of those who voted (estimated at 43% of the population) were in favor of independence \u2013 but Spain's constitutional court later ruled the vote illegal.

VMEXICO CITY, MEXICO \u2013 OCTOBER 26: Sebastian Vettel of Germany and Ferrari in the Paddock during previews to the Formula One Grand Prix of Mexico at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on October 26, 2017 in Mexico City, Mexico © GETTY IMAGES/AFP / CLIVE MASON. MEXICO CITY, Mexico, Oct 26 \u2013 Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari are aiming to beat Lewis Hamilton and win the final three races of the season regardless of the outcome of the championship, he said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at a news conference ahead of this weekend\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix, the four-time world champion said also that Ferrari should stick with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene who, he said, had revitalised them. \u201cThe pity was there were a couple of races for us where were just not there to fight,\u201d he said, referring to his disappointing outings at the Singapore, Malaysian and Japanese Grands Prix. But, he added, it had been a \u201creally good year\u201d overall for Ferrari and that they had exceeded expectations. \u201cI would have loved be on three wheels even in those races, but they obviously got away from us and we were just sitting on the side-lines. \u201cThat was bitter. In the end it made a big difference that we are now where we are \u2014 we still have a chance, we want to win the last three races and I think we can. \u201cWe have proven probably everybody wrong. Overall the team has been incredible to be where we are now. No one expected us to be that strong, so there were a lot of positives.\u201d. Asked if Arrivabene should remain as the team boss, Vettel was adamant. \u201cAbsolutely. What is his strength? Look at the results, look at where Ferrari was after 2014, how competitive we were in 2014. \u201cThe spirit was down. He is the key person responsible for bringing that back, to open things up and change things that were done for 20 years before that.\u201d.

V The Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, on Thursday said it was not his responsibility to track the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, who is believed to be on the run.  Ikpeazu said this in an interview with State House correspondents shortly after a meeting he had with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.  Although he described Kanu as his brother, the governor noted that the IPOB leader was not in the custody of the state government.  \u201cThose who are looking for him may have a better knowledge and have the capacity to determine the location of anyone in Nigeria. There are people who are trained to track people and it is their responsibility, not mine,\u201d the governor said.  Ikpeazu said government was trying to set up a committee for the MSME Council and he was a critical stakeholder because his state is currently the SME hub of Nigeria.  He noted that the patronage of Made-in-Nigeria products in Abia was growing.  Part of the direct fallout of the campaign since the past 24 months, he said, was that some parts of Ariaria Market where the shoe-making enterprise was flourishing had enjoyed steady power for three weeks now on a pilot scheme courtesy of the agency in charge of rural power supply.  Beyond that, he said his government was interfacing and having better relationship with funding agencies and was able to attract about N1.3bn or N1.4 bn on direct sales from the Made-in-Aba shoes and dresses.

VApple wants you to carry your MacBook in style. . Now for sale at the Apple Store: a leather sleeve for the 12-inch MacBook. At $149, it's by far the most expensive \u2014 and coolest \u2014 MacBook sleeve Apple offers. The only other leather MacBook sleeve for sale on Apple.com is this slim sleeve which is loose, only comes in black, and is kind of ugly. The sleeve comes in two colors: a light "Saddle Brown," and a somewhat gloomy "Midnight Blue." The description states it's made of high-quality European leather with a soft microfiber lining. There's also an opening near the charging port that will allow you to charge your device while it's in the sleeve. The product will be available in Apple Stores on Nov. 1. If you just can't wait that long, same-day shipping can have it in your hands on Oct. 31. . Does that sound like a lot of beer money to give up for a storage sleeve? Perhaps, but remember: It's only a sixth of the price of the iPhone X. Heck, forget the silly iPhone X and just buy six of these \u2014 you'll be the sleekest kid in town. .

VThe Nigeria Union of Journalists, Nasarawa State Council has lauded Governor Umaru Al-Makura for appointing three journalists into various positions in the state. The Chairman of NUJ in the state, Dogo Shammah, gave the commendation in a statement he issued in Lafia on Friday. Shammah listed the appointees as Musa Elayo, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor; and Yahuza Idris, the Chairman of Lafia Local Government Interim Management Committee. He named the third appointee as Mohammed Alhassan, a member of the Karu Local Government IMC. Shammah said: \u201cThe appointment of the three veteran journalists is a clear indication of the togetherness and love the governor has for journalists.\u201d. The NUJ chairman described Al-Makura as the father of journalism in Nasarawa state. He, however, urged the appointees to give their best in service to justify the confidence reposed in them as members of the fourth estate of the realm. Shammah advised them to imbibe the spirit of transparency and accountability in service and be ambassadors of the journalism profession at all times. NAN reports that before their appointments, Elayo, Idris and Alhassan worked for the Nasarawa Broadcasting Service, Nasarawa State Ministry of Information and the Nigerian Newsday respectively.

VGrowing up, my favorite sweet treat was also my vice. I took a liking to raw cookie dough early on in life, much to my mother\u2019s dismay. Of course, she didn\u2019t want me to make a habit out of eating raw eggs. Why couldn\u2019t I just wait until the dough was done cooking to enjoy the cookies? I\u2019m telling you, child logic is an enigma. Every time we would ball up the dough to put it on cookie sheets, I would try to sneak spoonfuls from the blender.

VIt didn\u2019t look anything more serious than just an unfortunate series of events on \u201clive time\u201d, but on replay, it sure looks like Everton\u2019s Kevin Mirallas intentionally stamped on Cesc Fàbregas during the closing stages of Wednesday night\u2019s League Cup game at Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea ended up winning 2-1. While Fàbregas initiated the contact with a strong challenge to clear the ball as it was bouncing around in a group of players, causing Mirallas to jump up in the air to avoid contact, as the Everton man came down, he appeared to not only double-clutch his leg, but also angle it behind himself to reach the Chelsea midfielder\u2019s back. Neither of those look like natural actions of a player who jumps up while moving forward and wants to ensure a steady landing for himself. Judge for yourself:. don't see how anyone can say that Mirallas' stamp on Fàbregas was unintentional. he goes out of his way to kick out at him. pic.twitter.com/500DU2vYky. \u2014 amadí (@amadoit__) October 26, 2017 . It\u2019s perhaps just borderline enough to avoid further scrutiny from the FA. Maybe if his name was Diego Costa, it would be a different case \u2014 the media would be up in arms about yet another #CostaCrimes episode, and the FA, as they\u2019re wont to do, would cave in to the public pressure and at least appear to do their job. Don\u2019t expect the same thing to happen here. But we know what you did, Kevin.

V Wind farm silhouette as the sun sets. (Shutterstock / WDG Photo). Germans may get paid to use as much electricity as they can Sunday as Germany\u2019s utility companies try to drain power from the grid to deal with a spike in wind energy production. Wind turbines across the country are expected to produce 39,190 megawatts of electricity at 7 a.m. Sunday, a new record. That level of output is equivalent to 40 nuclear reactors and is enough to cover half of total German demand, Bloomberg reports. As energy output climbs, electricity prices are driven lower, sometimes below zero. Experts are predicting Sunday to be the first day this year where electricity prices remain below zero for the entire day, not just a few hours at a time. Germany experienced a sunny and windy day May 8 that caused renewable energy from solar panels and wind farms to plunge the price below zero for a few hours, according to Quartz. Renewables are vulnerable to swings in output on a seasonal and daily basis because they are dependent on the weather. Grid operators deal with the fluctuations by cutting off natural gas plants. Nuclear and coal plants are, however, not as responsive to price swings and usually stay running, even when companies are forced to shell out cash for customers to use energy.

VThe average age of a first-time driver is about 16-years-old. Your first few times behind the wheel are with an instructor who has just enough control of the vehicle to prevent accidents. After a certain amount of sessions, you\u2019re ready to pass a driving test \u2014 and even after that, you\u2019re not prepared enough to drive on busy roads all by yourself. But one 11-year-old boy got a little test of the road very early, and without proper supervision. In the boy\u2019s defense, it wasn\u2019t his fault that he found himself behind the wheel \u2014 it was his uncle\u2019s. Cops pulled over an erratic Honda after other drivers called 911 about the driver. The boy was in the driver\u2019s seat, sitting on a pile of clothes, which was necessary for him to see over the wheel. Next to him was his intoxicated uncle, 29-year-old Genoro Lopez. Cops asked the child why he was driving, and he answered that he was learning. Then he revealed the truth: his uncle wanted to avoid a DUI, so he got the pre-teen behind the wheel instead. But that wasn\u2019t the only crime Genoro was guilty of: he also didn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license. The man was arrested and charged with felony child endangerment and for having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. More Stories from LittleThings.

VThe risk of serious heart problems after open heart surgery nearly doubles when the operation is performed in the morning rather than the afternoon, researchers shows. PHOTO| FILE| NMG. The risk of serious heart problems after open heart surgery nearly doubles when the operation is performed in the morning rather than the afternoon, researchers said Friday. Experiments and lab tests pointed to our biological clock as the primary cause of the startling difference in outcomes, they reported in the medical journal The Lancet. "Our study found that post-surgery heart damage is more common among people who have heart surgery in the morning," said lead author David Montaigne, a cardiologist at the University of Lille. "The time of day - that is, the biological clock or circadian rhythm - influences the patient's reaction to this kind of operation," he told AFP. The circadian clock governs the body's day-night cycles, thus influencing sleep patterns, the release of hormones, and even body temperature. When disrupted - as with jetlag - repeatedly over long periods, it can aggravate depression, bipolar disorder, cognitive function, and memory formation, research has shown. Earlier this month, the Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded to three US scientists who pioneered our understanding of how the circadian clock ticks. The new study unfolded in four steps. To start, scientists examined medical records for nearly 600 people who had surgery to replace heart valves, half in the morning, half in the afternoon. Fifty-four of 298 afternoon patients experienced heart attacks or other major cardiac events in the 500 days after the operation, compared to 28 out 298 of the morning patients. Then, in a year-long clinical trial, 88 patients were randomly scheduled for morning or afternoon valve replacement surgery. Not only did tissue from the afternoon group show less damage, it also regained the ability to contract more quickly in lab tests that mimicked the heart refilling with blood.

VA 60-year-old man, Nuhu Mohammed, on Thursday pleaded guilty to raping his 12-year-old daughter and her 13-year-old friend. Mohammed, who appeared before a Minna, Niger State Magistrate\u2019s Court, is standing trial on a one-count charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with two minors. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the offence runs contrary to Section 18(2) of the Child Rights Law of Niger State 2010. Mohammed, after pleading guilty to the offence, begged the court for leniency. NAN reports that his plea was, however, not taken by the Magistrate, Fati Auna, on the grounds that her court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. Auna directed the Police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice and ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison pending the advice. She, thereafter, adjourned the matter until November 16 for further mention. The Police Prosecutor, Emmanuel Danladi, had told the court that one Ahmad Aliyu of Garatu village in Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State reported the matter at the Kpakungu Police Station on October 17. Danladi alleged that the defendant had lured the two minors into his shop and had carnal knowledge of them. He further told the court that the defendant confessed to the crime during police investigation. Get more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook.

p2592

VSignaling what could be a critical victory against Republican gerrymandering, a federal court overseeing the redrawing of North Carolina's state legislative districts has appointed a nonpartisan "special master" in anticipation of the court rejecting the GOP's new district maps and having to redraw some itself. North Carolina Republicans passed new state Senate and state House gerrymanders earlier in 2017 to comply with a court order invalidating their old maps for illegally abusing race. The court rejecting these new maps would be a major boon to black voters\u2019 rights, and it could consequently see Democrats win more seats in 2018. While the court has not yet formally rejected any of the GOP's redrawn districts, its order appointing the special master expressed concern that two Senate districts and seven House districts "either fail to remedy the identified constitutional violation or are otherwise legally unacceptable." It furthermore called the possibility of such a finding "likely" when it will soon rule on the validity of Republican legislators' new maps. Redrawing these problematic districts would consequently involve changes to some of the neighboring seats, too, and this would be the best outcome that the plaintiffs could hope for. The recently redrawn districts were still aggressively gerrymandered to preserve Republican veto-proof majorities, but fairer maps could prove critical to Democratic chances of surpassing the two-fifths of seats in 2018 needed to sustain Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's vetoes. That's a very distinct possibility, since Democrats only need to gain four seats in the 120-member House to do so. If the district court does indeed redraw some of the districts, Republican legislators may once again appeal to the Supreme Court in an effort to drag things out past 2018. However, the high court previously in 2017 upheld the lower court ruling that struck down the original 2011 gerrymanders, and it may once again uphold a district court ruling that curbs the worst of the GOP's new partisan maps. Ultimately, North Carolina appears to be one step closer to having fairer legislative districts that allow Democrats to place a check on a state Republican Party that has gone to extremes to undermine the democratic process.

VBrendon Hartley © Getty Images.  Rookie Brendon Hartley will focus on his own expectations at this weekend\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix after being confirmed with the Toro Rosso team for the rest of the year.  Having made a solid debut when he finished 13th at last weekend\u2019s United States Grand Prix, the New Zealand driver was retained at the expense of Russian Daniil Kvyat as Frenchman Pierre Gasly returned after missing the race in Texas.  "Everyone understood that it was a very tall ask for me in Austin," Hartley told reporters. .  "It's clear the pressure gets higher. But I'm going to do my best to stay as relaxed as I was in Austin. .  "As driver a lot of the pressure comes from within so, it's more about me managing that and just focusing on what's important.".  Hartley became the first New Zealand driver in Formula One for 33 years when he took part in the race in Texas and he has been confirmed for the races Mexico, Brazil and Abu Dhabi.  "I'm really looking forward to it. I learned a lot in Austin and it was a pretty steep learning curve," added Hartley. .  "This weekend, I think I\u2019ll have the capacity to play a bit more with the car and to understand it a bit more \u2013 there was a lot to focus on last week.".  The Mexican event is a memorable one for New Zealand motor racing fans because it was the venue where the late Denny Hulme won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1967.

VDays after picking up the Men's FIFA 'Best' award, four time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped out of the '25 most valuable players' list, according to Football Manager 2018. . In the new release, Ronaldo has been valued at \u20ac55 million by the makers of FM, which is significantly lower than the likes of Lionel Messi, Paul Pogba, Ivan Rakitic and Alexis Sanchez. . The reason behind his decrease in value is perhaps his age, but even at the age of 32, Ronaldo produced the goods once again last season. . As well as lifting the European Championship trophy with Portugal last summer, the former Manchester United winger won both La Liga and the Champions League with Real Madrid. . Not to mention the fact he scored 55 goals in 55 games for club and country. . But still, Sports Interactive have bravely ousted the 32-year-old from the top 25 most valuable players on Football Manager 2018. . Neymar sits at the top of the 'most valuable' table, while Lionel Messi and Kevin de Bruyne take second and third place respectively. . The majority of players included below is made up of players from Manchester United, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. . Top 10 Most Valuable Players On Football Manager 2015 (via: Goal). Last year, Football Manager made Cristiano Ronaldo the third best player in the world behind Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer and Lionel Messi, which looks rather bizarre considering his success in the 15/16 season. . Thoughts on FM's decision to value Ronaldo at \u20ac55 million on the new release?. <img src="http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/905b51e55873a8f2381b3a62d6f39e45.jpg" data-orig-height="1599" data-orig-width="2256" alt="Ronaldo" "="">.

V Phil Foden could have made his professional Manchester City debut this week - but will instead be appearing in a World Cup final for his country. . The 17-year-old is one of three teenage Blues alongside goalkeeper Curtis Anderson and defender Joel Latibeaudiere to have gone with England Under-17s to India for the competition.  The trio have started every game as the young Lions have made it all the way to the final , which they will play against Spain on Saturday. .  City could have called any of their players back - Dortmund did that with former Blue Jadon Sancho, who then made his Bundesliga debut for the club - and Pep Guardiola would have been able to rest more of his first-team stars for the league cup tie with Wolves had he done that. . However, the Blues boss reckons that the gains the youngsters will make by representing their country in such circumstances outweigh the potential for one game at club level. "We had the the opportunity for him to stay here with us and maybe play against Wolves but we believe that when these guys have the opportunity to play a World Cup against Brazil, Spain, Italy etc in India, for them it is an amazing opportunity to see the high level of their age in a big competition. "It will be really good for their growth. "We are so happy for Joel, Curtis, and Phil. It\u2019s good for English football. "I think they made the final of the previous tournament and are getting used to making them. That is fantastic. Big congratulations to the team. "The final will not be easy against Spain - they've dominated football in all categories - but it\u2019s good. We will try to watch it of course.".

VThe MTN Foundation, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and other healthcare agencies, has launched the Yellow Heart Campaign, an initiative which aligns with global efforts to meet the Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 health targets and the global strategy for women and children\u2019s health. The campaign, which is designed to reduce maternal and child mortality by increasing the levels of awareness and perception of the phenomenon in our country and galvanizing action to support ongoing efforts, was launched at an event in Abuja on Thursday, October 26th, 2017. Commenting on the importance and rationale for this initiative, Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole said \u201cThe health of women and children is of paramount importance to the development of any society and this is why the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Health, has set up a task force specifically designed to stem maternal and infant mortality rates in the country. The partnership with MTN Foundation, through the Yellow Heart Initiative will further accelerate the progress already being recorded by the task force.\u201d. \u201cI commend the MTN Foundation for birthing this initiative and for also improving the quality of life of various Nigerian communities through their numerous interventions.\u201d He concluded. Also commenting on MTN\u2019s decision to support the Federal Ministry of Health on this initiative, Executive Secretary, MTN Foundation, Nonny Ugboma said \u201cmost deaths of mothers and children in our communities can be prevented using existing knowledge, and proven cost-effective interventions.\u201d. This is a global problem; according to UN reports, since 1990, maternal deaths have dropped by 45 percent, however every single day in 2016 about 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. In the same year, 15,000 children died before their fifth birthday, 46% of them (7,000 babies) died in the first 28 days of life. The main causes were preventable and treatable. Sadly, despite multiple interventions by the public and private sectors, Nigeria remains one of the largest contributors to global maternal and child mortality rates. \u201cThese are our loved ones, family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and a new generation needlessly lost; leaving behind unfulfilled hopes and broken dreams\u201d Ugboma added, \u201cwe must do better, together.\u201d. With this commitment, the Foundation has partnered with the Ministry of Health on multiple projects related to this cause. This includes the Maternal Ward Support project which has facilitated the renovation of 24 maternal wards across the country, and the \u2018Y\u2019ello Doctor\u2019 project which has seen Mobile clinics supporting the medical needs of mothers and children commissioned in six states. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Sponsored Content.

VA gang of armed robbers on Thursday attacked a branch of the Skye Bank Plc in Ifon, the headquarters of the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State, killing two police officers attached to the bank and went away with an undisclosed huge amount of money. According to Punch reports, the incident put a halt to social and commercial activities in the town for several minutes as residents living close to the bank ran for safety. The robbery operation was said to have lasted for about 40 minutes. Punch quoted an an eyewitness s saying that the hoodlums numbering fifteen stormed the premises of the bank at about 3pm and blew up the bullet-proof door of the bank with substance suspected to be dynamite before gaining entrance. Some of the robbers were said to have engaged the policemen in a gun duel outside the bank while others robbed the bank\u2019s vault. It was gathered that stray bullets from the hoodlums killed a yet to be identified man at a medical clinic beside the bank. The eyewitness said, \u201cThey came in three vehicles and they were up to 15 in number, they were heavily armed. When they got to the bank they could not enter easily because the bank had stopped attending to customers. So, they had to blow the door up with dynamite.  \u201cFor several minutes, they were shooting everywhere, two of the policemen that engaged them were killed but none of the robbers was killed during the shooting.\u201d . The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Femi Joseph confirmed the incident. He said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that we lost two of our men in the incident, but we are still on the trail of the robbers, they went to the bank with sophisticated weapon and inspite of that our men still engaged them. \u201cThe CP himself led the team from Akure to the scene it was when they (robbers) knew that we were closing in on the them that they ran away with bullets wounds. We shall get them soonest because our men are still on their trail.\u201d. To Receive News Alert On WhatsApp, Add 08027397554;.  For Adverts Enquiries, Whatsapp 08027397554,.

After Ronald Koeman revealed that Olivier Giroud nearly signed to Everton, the FC guys ponder how the striker would've fit. Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye has agreed a new five-year deal at the club, sources close to the player have told ESPN FC. Gueye has been locked in talks over a new deal for several weeks and an agreement has now been reached. Senegal international Gueye has impressed since his arrival from Aston Villa in the summer of 2016 and made 35 appearances in all competitions in his debut season at Goodison Park last term and he has become a big fans' favourite with the Everton faithful. Everton have decided to reward Gueye for his progress in his first year at the club with improved terms to bring him in line with other top earners at the club and recognise his importance to the first-team. News of Gueye's new deal will come as a welcome boost to the club after a difficult week following the sacking of manager Ronald Koeman on Monday.

VAccording to organisers, Rwanda Automobile Club (RAC), the two-day event is part of the National Rally Championship held in memory of the late Claude Gakwaya, one of the best Rwandan rally drivers, who passed away in a motor accident in 1986. "All is set for the rally, everything will go as planned. We are ready to have a smooth event," said Eric Gakwaya, the event organizer. Gakwaya added that this year's rally will be special and more interesting because it will also include the popular Motocross Freestyle race which will feature riders from South Africa. 14 crews from regional countries are expected to compete in the race. They include five from Rwanda, six from Uganda, and three from Burundi. Drivers will compete in competitive sections through Rango, Gisagara and Rwasave before returning to Huye town where they will race three times. In the afternoon, the event will shift to Huye Stadium where the motor cross race will take place at night. Two South African riders as well as eight local Motocross riders will compete in the freestyle category and the first day of event will cover a total of 125km. On the last day of the rally (Sunday) the drivers will start from Save-Rango to Shyanda where they will race four times before the closing ceremony. Roshanali and Jean Jeans Giesen are the reigning champions of the rally.

VTottenham Hotspur\u2019s Harry Kane is a huge doubt to play Manchester United this weekend, The Sun reports. Apparently, the superstar striker is suffering from a hamstring injury, which also kept him out of Spurs\u2019 game against West Ham United on Wednesday afternoon. To give you an idea of how deadly Kane is, the striker has scored 17 goals in his last 14 outings for both club and country. As we all know, United\u2019s Premier League form has dipped over the last couple of fixtures, and the Red Devils simply need all the help they can get. Three points against Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men would be huge. It\u2019d get United back on the right track in the best way possible. We\u2019re currently five points off the pace at the top, but make no mistake about it, Manchester City will have a blip \u2013 we just need to be ready to make the most of it. We\u2019ve had a good run of results against Spurs at Old Trafford, winning our last three without conceding a goal. All the signs are seemingly pointing in the direction of a home victory, so, I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll be celebrating a crucial victory on Saturday afternoon. Picture. Club News. Just for Fun.

VIf you're not in the Halloween spirit, Facebook is here to help. . The social network is unveiling several features to spook up your news feed, camera, and Messenger. . Starting today, Facebook is sending notifications to inform people of Halloween events near them. There are more than 500,000 of these parties and get-togethers planned around the world. But that's not all. Starting Oct. 27, you'll be able to add three Halloween-themed backgrounds to your text posts. The backgrounds feature a classic cast of bats, zombies, spiders, and jack-o-lanterns. . You'll be able to impress your friends with a slew of festive camera features. If you access your camera from the Facebook app, you can decorate your photos, video chat, and live video with over a dozen creepy masks, stickers, and filters. . Starting Oct. 25, you can also try on costumes on Messenger's camera, or scare your friends with them on Messenger video chat. . To top it off, starting Oct. 27, there will be a Halloween game hidden in your camera. You'll play the role of a trick-or-treater trying to escape a haunted house. . All features will be available through Halloween itself. . Facebook claims that Halloween is one of the top content-generating holidays of the year. And with competitors such as Snapchat releasing Halloween-themed geofilters and virtual trick-or-treating experiences, it was only a matter of time before Facebook jumped to emphasize the holiday to its users. Enjoy the photo effects with your friends, and best of luck surviving that house. .

Vsaechang/Flickr. In addition to a bag full of free candy, dressing up in a costume this Halloween can also score you a discounted burrito. Fortune reports that Chipotle will be giving anyone who shows up to one of its stores in costume on Halloween a burrito, burrito bowl salad, or taco for just $3. Chipotle notes that orders have to be made in person at the counter, so you can\u2019t make them online, using the mobile app, or via fax (is that a thing people do?). They want to be able to verify you are, in fact, wearing a sweet Halloween costume worthy of the discount. Screenshot: E.Price. That savings is great, but the real prize in the restaurant\u2019s Halloween promotion this year is a \u201cBurritos for a Year\u201d sweepstakes. For that, you have to text \u2018BOORITO\u2019 or \u2018SPOOKY\u2019 to 888222 before the end of the day October 31st. From all its mobile entries, Chipotle will select one winner to receive 52 \u201cfree burrito cards\u201d to get a free burrito each week up to a $10 value.

South Africa\u2019s INDABA, ITB of Berlin in Germany and SITE of Tanzania,\u201d a joyful Mdachi explained. She said it was an honour to get the award, which also made Tanzania\u2019s tourism sector shine globally. Describing her long journey in the sector which started way back 1993 when she joined TTB as tourism information officer and the first woman to hold that post,Ms Mdachi rose through the ranks to the post of managing director. \u201cNothing is impossible with hard work and determination. I urge my fellow women to join the tourism sector since it has many opportunities and also gives them chances to reach many areas of attractions in the world,\u201d she explained. The Award dubbed \u2018Top 100 African Women in Tourism\u2019 is issued annually by AKWAABA African Travel Market, who are the organizers in Lagos, Nigeria, where on September 11, this year, Ms Mdachi and the two counterparts from East Africa were among its recipients.

Tourism needs one to be innovative and networking constantly,\u201d she said, calling for women to embark on tourism business to better their lives. On her part, Ms Githinji, who operates a tourism firm in Tanzania, said despite the challenges the sector faces, she is highly optimistic that she did not make a mistake to be part of the tourism sector. \u201cThere are some challenges facing the sector, but this award has made me a courageous woman fulfilling all my obligations within it. We are doing a lot in promoting East Africa internationally and Tanzania is of no exception,\u201d she stressed.

VTottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks has revealed that Luka Modric is one of his heroes and is eager to emulate the Croatian's playing style. Modric was at White Hart Lane between 2008 and 2012 before earning a move to Real Madrid, where he has established himself as one of the top midfielders in the world. Winks, who has recently broken into the Spurs first team, went head to head with the 32-year-old at the Bernabeu on October 17 as the North Londoners claimed a 1-1 draw in their Champions League group game. "Luka Modric was one of my heroes," the 21-year-old told Sky Sports News. "I saw him training when I was U15s and U16s but never actually got the chance to train with him. It was a little bit surreal lining up next to him in the tunnel. "He is somebody I would love to emulate, his playing style. I'm not the tallest - neither is he - so his style is something I look up to. He seems like a great guy off the pitch too, that's something all the lads that have played with him have said.". Winks is expected to start for Spurs as they face Manchester United in Saturday's early Premier League kickoff.

VVerizon and Ericsson reached another milestone in 4G LTE Advanced Technologies that will also serve as a stepping stone to 5G technology by completing their first deployment of FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing) Massive MIMO (Multiple Input \u2013 Multiple Output) on Verizon\u2019s wireless network in Irvine, CA. This deployment will improve both spectral and energy efficiency, increasing network capacity for current devices in the market. Further significant enhancements are expected to come as new devices evolve toward 5G. For customers, the result will be higher and more consistent speeds for using apps and uploading and downloading files. \u201cWhile continuing to drive 5G development, the deployment of Massive MIMO offers very tangible benefits for our customers today. As we innovate, we learn and continue to lay the groundwork and set the standards for 5G technology,\u201d said Nicola Palmer, Chief Network Officer of Verizon Wireless. \u201cOur collaboration with Ericsson on this new deployment continues to drive industry-wide innovation and advancements.\u201d. Today\u2019s Massive MIMO deployment involves 16 transceiver radio units driving an array of 96 antenna elements supplied by Ericsson. The deployment is running on a 20 MHz block of AWS spectrum. Four way transmit has been widely deployed throughout the Verizon network and has contributed to significant 4G LTE advancements. In Massive MIMO \u2013 the next step of antenna array evolution \u2013 the high number of transmitters enables more possible signal paths. It also enables beamforming, which directs the beam from the cell site directly to where the customer is, dramatically cutting down on interference. Reduced interference results in higher and more consistent speeds for customers. Niklas Heuveldop, Head of Market Area North America at Ericsson, said: \u201cMassive MIMO is a key technology enabler for 5G, but already today, 4G LTE service providers and end users can benefit from the superior capacity and network performance this technology enables. The current trial is an important step in the collaboration we have with Verizon to prepare their network for 5G.\u201d. As part of an Intelligent Edge Network that processes data where it\u2019s generated, this Massive MIMO deployment is another step in technological innovation and leadership. As Verizon begins deploying Massive MIMO in the future throughout the network in places where there are capacity needs, customers with compatible devices will automatically begin taking advantage of this technological advancement.

VAccra, Oct. 27, GNA \u2013 Toyota, Ghana on Friday held the 2017 Toyota users conference in line with Toyota\u2019s policy of getting closer to customers and to thank them for their continues patronage of their product. The conference which was on the theme: \u201cEver better through authorised dealer\u201d, was to explain to customers the importance of buying their favourite Toyota model from Toyota Ghana. Mr Takuya Kajiura, Managing Director, Toyota Ghana said the goal of Toyota Ghana is to create lifetime customers for the company, while delivering the best purchasing and ownership experience. He said by this they strive to take full care of customers always, through continuous improvement of established systems to promote sustainable growth. He said the conference also signifies how Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) valued Ghana customers, and would serve as a platform to listen to customer concerns and how best to address them to guarantee satisfaction. Mr Kajiura said the company believes that the advancement of Toyota Ghana should be parallel to that of Ghana and as such continue to contribute their quota to education, health, road safety and environment. He said as responsible corporate citizens they work to be accepted by the society in which they operate, and have achieved a lot both locally and internationally. Dr Eric Dako, Executive Director, TMC Toyota said cars are the second most expensive single thing to find in a household and should always give customers the peace of mind, adding that the best car to own is one that all the game players including manufacturers, distributors and dealers place the customer first in their minds. He said at Toyota Ghana the customer first principle is deeply rooted in every aspect, by putting the customer in the driver\u2019s seat even before the car is produced. \u201cCustomer first means producing and delivering the right vehicle, right customer, right region, right condition and at the right time.\u201d. Dr Dako said the company also takes into consideration the road conditions, weather conditions, technological conditions, fuel quality, off factory installations before approving the use of certain vehicles in certain regions. He urged customers to get the right vehicle, assuring them that Toyota uses authorized dealers to get the best vehicles purchase and ownership experience to customers in every region. Madam Ayako Koizumi, TMC said Toyota was formed about 80 years ago, operates in over 170 countries worldwide with a manufacturing base in 28 countries. She said they always try to produce the highest quality vehicle by ensuring that quality is built in during the manufacturing process and test them before distributing. She urged customers to ensure to get the right vehicle, genuine spare parts and superior after sale support by continuing to purchase from Toyota Ghana.   GNA.

VOwerri\u2014The Imo State Police Command, yesterday, exhumed the remains of the body of a 24-year-old man, Stanley Eluwa Ihechika, from a forest in Ohaji/Egbema Local Government Area of the state, allegedly killed and buried by one 18-year-old Bobo John. Speaking to newsmen at the scene, the Command\u2019s Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Andrew Enwerem, said it was in the same forest that the body of a 63-year-old woman was discovered. Enwerem said: \u201cIt is a story of robbery and murder of a missing man, one Stanley Eluwa Ihechika, age 24, who is from Awarra in Ohaji/Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State. \u201cAs a motorcyclist, he operates within Awarra and Umuagwo, in the council area. He left home on October 5, but did not return home. \u201cThe family reported the incident to the Police Division, Ohaji. The Police went into an investigation and, on October 24, arrested one Bobo John, aged 18. \u201cHe was arrested for a case of stealing an amplifier of New Life Bible Church, in Awarra. In the course of investigation, he was identified as a member of secret cult group called Iceland. \u201cAlso, following the investigation, Bobo revealed that the missing Stanley Eluwa was killed and buried by him and four others now at large.\u201d.

VTHE MEYHEM LAUREN "EUROPEAN MANEUVERS" TOUR IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN ... ALL EUROPEAN PROMOTERS HOLLA AT NOENIX@GMAIL.COM OR KIRK@KREAMGROUP.COM ?@STOCKROLL.  A post shared by MEYHEM LAUREN (@meyhemlauren) on Sep 1, 2017 at 11:46am PDT. Queens rapper Meyhem Lauren and Cypress Hill producer DJ Muggs have teamed up for a new collaborative project, Gems From The Equinox. . Packed with 11 fresh tracks, the album features some of the usual suspects, including Action Bronson, Hologram and B-Real. Roc Marciano, Conway, the late Sean Price and Mr. Muthafuckin\u2019 eXquire contribute some colorful verses as well. True to form, the album retains a strict East Coast Hip Hop vibe and a raw grittiness typically found throughout Lauren\u2019s catalog. His last album, Piatto D\u2019oro, was released in 2016 and featured a couple of the same contributors such as Bronson and Hologram. As a bonus, the duo has also rolled through with a video for \u201cHashashin\u201d featuring Conway. Directed by David Sakolsky, the visual finds the trifecta hitting dark alleyways while delivering their signature brand of \u201990s-flavored Hip Hop. Check out the video above, and the album stream, cover art and tracklist below. Camel Crush. Street Religion f. Roc Marciano. Shea Stadium f. Action Bronson. Hashashin f. Conway. Aquatic Violence f. Mr. MFN eXquire & Sean Price. 151. War Drums f. Hologram & BENNY THE BUTCHER. Szechuan Peppercorn f. Action Bronson & Hologram. Redrum. Murder Rap. Tension f. Action Bronson & B-Real.

VJesse Lingard says Manchester United want to keep making teams scared of coming to Old Trafford, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur's visit on Saturday. Sides should already be wary of the trip to M16, given the fact we are 36 games unbeaten at the Theatre of Dreams in all competitions \u2013 a run which stretches back to September 2016. In addition to that impressive record, Jose Mourinho\u2019s men are yet to concede at home in the Premier League this term, and have conceded just once at home across all competitions. Lingard, fresh from his double in Tuesday's 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Swansea City, told MUTV that he believes Old Trafford has already become a fortress once again. \u201cA lot of people have said that. Teams that come here are scared to play, and that\u2019s the vibe we want to give off," he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting that consistency now \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a huge game at the weekend. \u201cIf we can get the win it\u2019s a huge marker to set down and we need everyone in the squad ready to do that.\u201d. The 24-year-old England star did, however, admit it will be one of the toughest challenges of the season so far when the Reds face Spurs in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off. \u201cThey\u2019re doing really well right now \u2013 they\u2019re third in the league, right behind us,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, it\u2019ll be an interesting game with a lot of quality players on show. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to concentrate on what we\u2019ve got to do \u2013 and that\u2019s to win the game. Sometimes we\u2019ve been in big games where we\u2019ve not performed as well as we'd have wanted, but we\u2019ve won the game, and the most important thing is to get all three points.\u201d.

VPolice have praised the girl for speaking up and hope that it will encourage other victims of honour based violence to come forward. The teenager was subjected to violence after her father discovered she removed her hijab in public (file photo). A Quebec man has been charged with "honour-based violence" after he allegedly assaulted his teenage daughter after discovering she had been removing her hijab in public. The man had reportedly subjected his daughter to repeated assaults over a period of a year, with the violence escalating when he learnt that she had not been wearing the traditional Islamic dress while away from the family home. Gatineau police said Friday the girl had reported the assaults- which reportedly also involved weapons - resulting in her father's arrest on Wednesday (25 October) . "It took a lot of courage for this young girl to come up to police and to inform us of what was happening," Sgt. Jean-Paul Lemay said. The 35-year-old Gatineau resident appeared in court Thursday on charges of assault, assault with a weapon and uttering threats. Police have not released the man's name to protect the alleged victim's identity. Lemay said the force hopes the girl's bravery will prompt other alleged victims of violence to come forward. According to The Star, he said police hope to send a message to others in similar situations to assure them resources exist to help them. "Victims of these types of crimes are often isolated and it can be very difficult to come forward," Lemay said. "The ones who do, we want them to know we will listen to them, but they will also be supported during the (legal) process.". The teen has been removed from the family home and is in the care of youth protection.

VLate George Michael. George Michael\u2019s chart-topping 1990 album \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\u201d returned straight to number one in the British charts on Friday, 10 months after the British pop star\u2019s death at the age of 53. The remastered record sold over 56,000 copies to come first in the charts in the largest first-week sales for a re-released album in charts history. The album was reissued to coincide with a new documentary about the star\u2019s rise to fame. Its instant appeal matches the success of the original release \u2014 Michael\u2019s second solo album after he left the duo Wham! \u2014 which also shot straight to number one in September 1990. It went on to sell more than eight million copies worldwide. Michael \u2014 who was found dead on Christmas Day last year \u2014 personally oversaw the remastering of the record prior to his death. It includes an \u201cMTV Unplugged\u201d set from 1996 and a previously unreleased track, \u201cFantasy\u201d, featuring Nile Rodgers. The album was released following the airing earlier this month on British TV of the film \u201cGeorge Michael: Freedom\u201d, which the singer had also been personally guiding before he died. David Austin, Michael\u2019s manager, long-term collaborator and close friend since childhood, said the team behind the efforts were \u201cincredibly proud\u201d to have immediately topped the charts. \u201cIt\u2019s no great secret that George was a perfectionist and it shows, he was over everything from its inception to its finish and it\u2019s a blessing and rare gift to be guided by such genius,\u201d he added in a statement. Michael, one of the most successful British artists ever, enjoyed album sales of more than 115 million, alongside Andrew Ridgeley in the band Wham! and then as a solo artist. AFP.

VThe Bayelsa Government has recorded N1.3 billion as Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) in September, the Deputy Governor, retired Rear Adm. John Jonah, said on Friday. Breaking the financial statement for September in Yenagoa, Jonah said the state had realised about N1.3 as IGR in August. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Bayelsa had collected N868.58 million in the previous month. The deputy governor attributed the increase to tax reforms which hiked tax drive on oil firms operating in the state. He noted that the state Board of Internal Revenue was compelled to approach the courts to seal some companies that defaulted in paying their taxes. Jonah said that the development had also increased the cost of collecting the huge revenue to N88 million. On the revenue accrued to state from Federation Account for September, the deputy governor said Bayelsa had received N12.1 billion as against N9.94 billion in August. Jonah said total deductions in September amounted to N1.8 billion as against the N1.7 billion deducted in August, leaving the state with a net inflow of N8.28 billion. He said that the wage bill of the state for August salary captured in September\u2019s statement stood at N3.7 billion for civil servants while N298 million was spent on the emoluments of political appointees. (NAN). \u2022Photo by Michael Owi Bayelsa State Deputy Governor, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha John Jonah (Rtd)(2nd R), delivers the State Financial Report, while the Chief of Staff, Government House, Yenagoa, Rt.

VA senior Ghanaian journalist once said, after the electoral defeat of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in 2008, that if the media houses sympathetic to the John Kufuor-led Government had told him just twenty percent of truth, the party could probably not have lost that election. We are tempted to agree with that assertion considering how hard the then government worked and the level of development as well as social mitigation policies it introduced and was implementing. Those developmental projects and goodwill generated by the social mitigation policies seems to have been eroded by other factors. Factors the media that was supposed to be watch dogs shied away from highlighting because they had partially become pet dogs pampering the government. We beg to be different. We would not shy away from pointing at wrong doing when we see one. We would not shy away from constructive criticisms. We would not give Fan Fool respect openly and then complain bitterly behind the closed doors of our newsrooms. We want to be bold in telling the President that some of his appointees, particularly the ones he tasked to put a stop to the rising vigilantism, are taking his words for granted and he should either crack the whip or take the blame himself. Mr. President, Citi FM, alone, has reported on 18 separate violent and attacks perpetrated by pro-NPP groups since the beginning of the NPP administration, the latest being the forceful locking up of some offices at the Karaga District Assembly by some NPP youth. Perhaps, the National Security Minister and the persons in charge of the security of this country are expecting Nana Akufo-Addo to become a policeman himself, walking across the streets and corners, in chase of such lawless thugs who are making his government look bad. It is clear that some few lawless souls have decided to test their might against that of the State and for some ten months, the tomfoolery has continued while the National Security Minister, the Interior Minister, the Inspector General of Police and all those paid with taxpayer\u2019s money to maintain law and order, watch haplessly. They either have to work to maintain law and order, protect lives and property or get booted out!!. The President has a country to run. He has a government to lead. He has worked selflessly hard so far and it is therefore annoying that appointees that ought to do their jobs to maintain law and order are so lousy and disappointing to an extent one wonders why they are still at post.

VWales international forward Ben Woodburn has signed a new and improved contract with Liverpool, keeping him with the club until at least 2022. The 18-year-old academy graduate has enjoyed a whirlwind year, having made his debut for the Reds, become the club\u2019s youngest ever scorer and netted for Wales on his senior international debut. Woodburn\u2019s progress and promise has been rewarded by what Liverpool call a \u201clong-term\u201d deal\u2014a contract Press Association Sport understands will run over five years. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling to sign a new contract with Liverpool,\u201d he told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cThis is the club I want to stay at and be here as long as possible. When I was told, all I wanted to do was sign the contract. \u201cIt feels good. Now I just want to carry on and hopefully show the manager what I can do.\u201d. ADVERTISING. Woodburn joined Liverpool\u2019s academy as an U7s player and has risen through the ranks, being named the Academy Player of the Year for 2016/17. The forward has established himself in Jurgen Klopp\u2018s first team and played four times for Wales, netting the winner against Austria on his debut in September. \u201cI think there is loads of room for improvement,\u201d Woodburn added. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep working and trying in training every day and hopefully I will improve. \u201cDefending and maybe getting a few more goals [are what I want to improve]. Just trying to come in with the first team and play like a first-team player. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ve grown as a player and matured physically and technically, and grown in confidence. \u201cFor the rest of this season, my aim is just to carry on [and] try to play as many games for the U19s and first team.\u201d.

V Anna Okon.  The Standards Organisation of Nigeria says it has shut four steel companies across the country for non-compliance with requirements of the Nigerian Industrial standards (NIS 117) and global best practices.  The agency also warned that any steel manufacturer found circumventing quality assurance requirements would be prosecuted in line with the SON Act 14 of 2015.  According to a statement issued on Wednesday, the four firms were among those the agency investigated and conducted integrity tests on recently.  The Director-General, SON, Mr. Osita Aboloma, was quoted as advising steel manufacturers during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Lagos not to undermine their colleagues through the production of substandard steel reinforcement bars under the name and code of rival firms and competitors, adding that such act was detrimental to the unsuspecting end-users of the products.  The SON DG warned them to desist from tampering with any consignment put on hold by officials of the agency for suspected infractions during investigation and quality verification, stressing that such act by anyone would be prosecuted.  He reiterated the agency\u2019s commitment to ensuring the safety of lives and property of Nigerians, part of which informed its recent nationwide monitoring of steel production.  The SON boss expressed concern over the non-compliance by key stakeholders in the industry, maintaining that the agency would stop at nothing to bring sanity to Nigeria\u2019s steel sector.  \u201cPlayers producing without regard to the NIS 117 will not be tolerated,\u201d he said.  He disclosed that steps were being taken to harmonise standards for steel production across West Africa, stressing that this would avail steel manufacturers the opportunity of producing and exporting to different countries within the region.  The statement also quoted the Sectoral Executive, Basic Metal Group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Femi Gbadegun, as saying that the association was ready to imbibe the culture of producing good quality steel bars to meet the NIS standards.

VNairobi \u2014 The Supreme Court will Friday morning hear an application by Jubilee seeking to hold NASA leader Raila Odinga in contempt following his withdrawal from the Presidential race and alleged obstruction of the party's local agents from training, specifically in Siaya and Kisumu Counties. According to Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju, Raila - the National Super Alliance - leader together with his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka have engaged in conduct that can only be termed as illegal, unlawful and disrespectful, all geared towards ensuring that the orders of the Supreme Court are not implemented. Further, he said, that through the weekly "violent protests" in agitation for changes at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, the NASA leader has proven that he was not keen to participate in the October 26 repeat presidential election. The case was taken before Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, who directed the party to serve Odinga and Musyoka with the submissions. She then directed the case to be mentioned before the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court on October 27.

VMIUI 9 is the absolute latest iteration of Xiaomi's UI overlay on top of Android. It was officially unveiled back in July when the Mi 5X got announced. Since that point, there have been many beta builds of the MIUI 9 Global ROM for supported devices, and now we're thankfully very close to the stable version's release. The stable MIUI 9 Global ROM is going to be out on November 2, according to Xiaomi. This will at least be true for handsets sold in India. Not at all coincidentally, on that same day the company is holding an event in the subcontinent, during which it's promised to unveil a new selfie-centric smartphone series. The first device in that line will undoubtedly run MIUI 9 from day one. The new software is expected to be released in China by the end of this month. MIUI 9 comes with image search (by keywords depicting what is in the picture), a smart assistant (since the world obviously needs more of those), and a smart app launcher (which works based on screen content, so it will pop up Maps if you talk about going somewhere for example).

VSix fresh cases of monkeypox has been confirmed by the Federal Government including one in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. This was confirmed by the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, in Abuja on Friday, according to a statement by the Director of Media, Mrs. Boade Akinola. Ehanire said apart from Abuja, there are two new cases of the disease in Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom states each and one in Enugu, this brings the total number of confirmed monkeypox cases to nine. Ehanire noted that investigations were ongoing to see if any of the new cases had a link with the Bayelsa cluster, where the outbreak started. He called for calm among members of the public, as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is working with all affected states to ensure case finding and adequate management. The minister explained that as frightening as the manifestation of the ailment may seem, \u201cno fatality has been recorded till date. As of October 25, 2017, a total of 94 suspected cases have been reported from 11 states (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Rivers and the FCT).\u201d. He noted that the newly confirmed cases were patients already being managed by public health authorities and have been receiving appropriate clinical care since the onset of the illness. Ehanire stated that the Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC, was in close contact with all state epidemiology teams, as well as the health facilities providing clinical care to both suspected and confirmed cases. The minister said health commissioner across the 36s states had been advised to place all health care facilities and disease surveillance and notification officers on alert, to ensure early case detection, reporting and effective treatment. He said the NCDC had also deployed rapid response teams in the four states with confirmed cases. Ehanire said an interim national guideline for monkeypox had been developed and disseminated to all states for coordination of response activities.

VA TURTLE has returned alive from the edge of space in a bizarre experiment that could could help see humans holiday on the moon. The yellow headed temple turtle, called Little Cloud, soared 13 miles above earth's surface in a balloon rig. Yellow headed temple turtle Little Cloud survived a trip to the edge of space. The space travelling reptile was placed in a translucent capsule attached to a helium balloon pod via a sling for his mammoth mission. The Kuang-Chi Group launched Little Cloud from a site in north-western China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It was little more than four hours after take off that the little turtle touched back to earth safely using a parachute device. Little Cloud\u2019s capsule was fitted with controls for air pressure, oxygen levels and temperature, all of which were remotely regulated. The reptile was brought safely back to earth in a capsule attached to a parachute. The experiment could pave the way for people to holiday in space. The tech firm has said it is the first time a live animal has been safely sent to near-space and returned in this way. A similar attempt had failed last November. According to reports, Kuang-Chi, will charge some more than £80,000 for its near-space trips, with each pod sent up able to carry six passengers. They hope to begin flights next year or in 2019. CEO Luo Ruipeng said: "Journeys on commercial crafts into near-space can allow ordinary humans to achieve the dream of space travel.". The firm will be competing with tech giants from the US and UK, including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX programme as well as Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic.  Amanda Holden asks Major Tim Peake if he stole a piece of the moon in on-air This Morning gaffe .

VABC. It\u2019s rarely a good sign when a television show is \u201ctransitioned\u201d (that\u2019s a nice way of saying \u201cno one is watching\u201d) to Saturday, but it\u2019s especially worrisome when it\u2019s a new series. Ten Days In the Valley, starring Emmy winner Kyra Sedgwick and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is only four episodes into its first season, and ABC has already moved the drama from Sunday to Saturday. The series is being pulled from Sundays effective immediately and will take a break before starting its Saturday run on Dec. 16 with Episode 105 and 106 airing back-to-back at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. (Via). Ten Days In the Valley\u2018s premiere pulled in a measly 3.44 million viewers (including a limp 0.5 in the key adults 18-48 demo), and ratings have only sunk since. The most recent episode only drew 2.2 million, or double-digit millions less than the season\u2019s most popular new series, The Good Doctor. . Sedgwick saw the move coming from a mile away. \u201cI also think ABC\u2019s not doing a good job getting the word out there,\u201d she told the Daily Beast. \u201cWhen I was doing The Closer, literally the two weeks before we aired, Steve Koonin\u2019s goal was that everyone living in a major city would be exposed to something about The Closer five times in a day. He used to run Coke, and he was the head of TNT marketing. And he made that happen. It\u2019s great that I get to do interviews for this now, because I have a track record. But the truth is that no one knows [Ten Days In the Valley] is on. So that\u2019s disturbing and scary.\u201d. The shift to Saturday probably won\u2019t help.

V The Portuguese did not even allow journalists to speak about the Spurs star before making a pre-emptive strike . Jose Mourinho headed off questions about Harry Kane's absence from Saturday's Premier League showdown between Manchester United and Tottenham. England striker Kane has fired Spurs to joint-second in the league with United, who will welcome Mauricio Pochettino's men to Old Trafford looking to re-establish a cushion after last week's defeat at Huddersfield Town. A hamstring injury will prevent the league's top scorer from playing, but Mourinho refused to divulge any tactical switches he could make, or his thoughts about taking on a clearly weakened opponent. Mourinho began his news conference: "Because I know the question I don't need the question, I'll answer. "I don't speak about injured players so don't ask me about Harry Kane, because to speak about Harry Kane I have to speak about [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, about [Paul] Pogba, about [Marcos] Rojo, about [Michael] Carrick, so I don't speak. Next question.". One player who will be available for Mourinho on Saturday is Nemanja Matic. United parted with £40 million to sign the Chelsea midfielder, but Tottenham's Eric Dier had also been linked with a switch to Old Trafford.  Article continues below . Pochettino accuses Mourinho of trying to unsettle the England international in his new book, but the United manager stated that Matic was always his number-one target. "I have the player that I want to have," Mourinho said. "Probably I have the player that I didn't think it was possible to have, but in the end we got the player that I really wanted.".

VThe 92-year-old woman was left covered in bruises after Sanchez Edwards, 28 robbed her (Picture: National). A violent addict has admitted a brutal mugging on a 92-year-old woman. Sanchez Edwards, 28, dragged the elderly woman along the pavement in an appalling attack after he absconded from a mental health unit. He targeted recently-widowed Gladys Scriven in broad daylight as she was posting a letter. She was left too terrified to leave her house following the horrific attack in Hoxton, north London, in July earlier this year. Edwards, who is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, is due to be sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court after admitting one count of robbery. He has a string of previous convictions for other robberies, supplying drugs and carrying weapons. Sanchez Edwards, 28 has admitted the mugging (Picture: Met Police). Edwards had been missing from the John Howard Centre medium secure unit since May before he was arrested in July following the mugging that was caught on CCTV. His victim, Gladys refused to let go of her bag before she was dragged along the pavement by Edwards until she was \u2018in so much pain that she eventually let go\u2019. Hooded Edwards eventually wrenched the handbag \u2013 containing a £50 Virgin mobile phone, a Freedom Pass, documents and £100 cash \u2013 off her and fled. She had popped out to post a letter and was headed to the Lawson Medical Centre in Hoxton when she was attacked from behind on Tuesday, June 27. Graphic footage showed Sanchez using so much force his victim was pulled to the ground. Police said Gladys, who had recently lost her husband of nearly 70 years, was left distraught and too terrified to leave her house. She suffered horrific bruising all over her body as well as several cracked ribs. The victim was covered in bruises (Picture: National). Despite being subject to a hospital order, Edwards was allowed out of the secure unit on unescorted leave and failed to return on May 17. The court heard Edwards was tracked and found to be using buses and tube trains around the capital after a £5,000 reward was offered for information about him. Detective Inspector Paul Ridley, from Hackney CID, said: \u2018Edward\u2019s attack has had a harrowing effect on his victim. \u2018In addition to the physical injuries she suffered, there is also the emotional impact and she still suffers from anxiety, re-occurring nightmares and remains terrified of leaving her home, the attack stripping her of her independence.\u2019. Still from the scene are horrifying (Picture: Met Police).

VApple's CarPlay infotainment system is finally coming to vehicles with two wheels. . Honda's new 2018 Gold Wing will be the first motorcycle in the world to have Apple CarPlay integration, according to CNET. The bike has a 7-inch LED screen on its handlebar dashboard, giving bikers a platform to control Maps, music, and more for an onscreen Apple experience that's been available on four wheels since 2014. Apple insisted on a few extra safeguards to bring CarPlay to the bike. The connection isn't wireless \u2014 a feature that's still rare for CarPlay-enabled vehicles of any type \u2014 so users have to plug their iPhone into one of the motorcycle's USB ports, which are in the trunk and the tank's storage cubby. . The CarPlay setup on the Gold Wing's screen. A separate Bluetooth device with a microphone is also required for the CarPlay functionality, so riders will need a pair of wireless headphones in order to use it. Google declined to include support for its own smartphone-connected infotainment system, Android Auto, according to the report. The Gold Wing's LCD screen doesn't have touch functionality, so riders have to depend on a panel on the motorcycle's tank or a four-way pad on the left handlebar to control their infotainment center on the road. That's much safer than fiddling on a phone while riding, which could be why Apple's finally bringing the platform to motorcycles. . The Gold Wing has a base price of $23,500 and hits the streets next February. It also offers a liquid-cooled six-cylinder engine, adaptive suspension, and a smart key. Your car might not have CarPlay, but your next motorcycle might. .

VIf you haven't heard about the Louis Theroux bot, you've been missing out. The Twitter account spits out fake documentary intros in the style of Theroux, who often focuses his attention on weird cults, religions, felons and well, anyone you'd probably never find yourself talking to. Here are a couple of the tweets, all very watchable documentaries, we must say. I'm in Madagascar to meet Anna, a former kitchen porter turned sex cult leader who believes eating popcorn betrays God. \u2014 Louis Theroux Bot (@louistherouxbot) October 26, 2017. I'm in New Mexico to meet Chase, a former bigfoot hunter turned evangelical swinger who believes mayonnaise is a myth. \u2014 Louis Theroux Bot (@louistherouxbot) October 26, 2017. I'm in California to meet Adam, a former teacher turned shock jockey who believes Hitler wrote Candle in the Wind. \u2014 Louis Theroux Bot (@louistherouxbot) October 24, 2017. I'm in Florida to meet Chase, a former barista turned alcoholic preacher who believes magnets make swans racist. \u2014 Louis Theroux Bot (@louistherouxbot) October 24, 2017. Well anyway, Theroux himself caught wind of the account \u2014 promising to read out this tweet. I'm in Amsterdam to meet Hannah, a former IT expert turned cybergoth who believes Hull is a portal to Hell. \u2014 Louis Theroux Bot (@louistherouxbot) October 25, 2017.

V This season, Liverpool Football Club is continuing its support of Fans Supporting Foodbanks with foodbank collections taking place at every home game at Anfield - and you can donate ahead of Saturday's encounter with Huddersfield. . In 2016-17, thanks to our fans\u2019 support, we helped to provide families in north Liverpool with more than 11,000 meals. . Supporters attending the game can drop off any non-perishable food donations at the foodbank collection points, which are located on Anfield Road, next to the club\u2019s Family Park, and inside the new LFC Anfield superstore. . Some priority foodbank items include:. UHT milk. Long-life juice or cordial. Jar pasta/curry sauce. Tinned meat. Tinned vegetables. Instant mash. Rice pudding/custard. Jam. Toiletries. Cup-a-Soup/noodles. Washing tablets. All food collected will be donated to the North Liverpool Foodbank, which provides local people in need with essential three to four-day food parcels. LFC\u2019s Red Neighbours programme is backing the Fans Supporting Foodbanks initiative, which aims to help tackle local food poverty. Food poverty and food education is one of Red Neighbours\u2019 key priorities, which were chosen after extensive consultation with the Anfield community about local needs.

VSignal's encrypted messaging service is down. With private messaging down on Signal, users on the mobile app and desktop services aren't sure how to communicate securely. Signal, the encrypted messaging tool from Open Whisper Systems favored by Edward Snowden, experienced outages Friday. The company said in an email it was aware of the outages in North America and Europe. In a transparent explanation the company said, "We suspect there may be some DDoS attempts, although it is still too early to tell." Apparently "suspicious activity" with IP addresses in Belarus and Ukraine might be the source of the program. Open Whisper Systems said it was working with its engineers and developers to get the servers back online. Meanwhile, dedicated users were not sure what to do during the outage. . Signal is down. Please contact me by postal mail. \u2014 Ali Gharib (@Ali_Gharib) October 27, 2017. Well, I guess Signal is down. \u2014 Sev (@sudosev) October 27, 2017.

VIf you snagged a pre-order reservation for the iPhone X this morning, a quick word of advice: be extra careful with that shiny new OLED screen once you finally get your hands on the phone. Fixing it will cost you. A lot. . Apple released the new non-warranty service cost information on its site this morning, where it was spotted by MacRumors. The number should give clumsy iPhone owners yet another reason to invest in a heavy duty case for their new premium smartphone: Repairing damage to the iPhone X's screen alone will cost U.S. customers $279, while "Other damage" fees for accidents cost you $549. . You read that right. Apple is charging the equivalent of a brand new iPhone 7, which people are reportedly still enthusiastically buying, to fix up a busted iPhone X. . AppleCare+ is the only thing that will save you from shelling out hundreds of dollars to fix up a thrashed phone. The Apple insurance plan for the iPhone X costs $199 for two years of service and covers two incidents of "accidental damage" at dramatically reduced rates. Each screen repair is $29, while "other damage" costs $99. The high costs make AppleCare+ even more attractive, and Apple's fight to keep "right to repair" bills off the books all the more frustrating. iPhone X customers are already paying at least a $999 base price for their brand new phone \u2014 and unless they pony up and extra $200 for AppleCare+, a busted screen could wind up costing them even more in the future. .

VThe e-Evolution concept burning out with the help of its AI assistant. Mitsubishi\u2019s new crossover concept doesn\u2019t want to drive for you. It wants to make you a better driver. . Most automakers are building up AI systems to run their future self-driving cars. But Mitsubishi recently unveiled its slightly different tack at the Tokyo Motor Show. . Mitsubishi's new e-Evolution concept is an all-electric crossover vehicle that promises a stiff dose of AI power. The vehicle doesn't look too far off from another of the Motor Show's all-electric hits, the Nissan IMx concept \u2014 but Mitsubishi isn't embracing full-on autonomy like Nissan. . The concept is powered by three electric motors, which draw power from a battery under the vehicle's floor. Mitsubishi didn't provide horsepower estimates or battery range projections, though, so the design behind the four-wheel drive SUV isn't exactly fully realized. . Mitsubishi's boldest idea for the e-Evolution is plugging an AI assistant directly into the vehicle's interface, like something out of camp classic Knight Rider. The automaker describes the system as a tool that can make the human driver more effective by using sensors "to instantly read changes in road and traffic conditions, as well as the driver's intent." . It doesn't sound anything like the autonomous systems currently being developed by carmakers and tech companies around the world \u2014 Mitsubishi talks up a "special coaching function" that gives the AI system power to "transfer knowledge to the driver" somehow, so the company is definitely imagining a system that won't take the driver out of the equation. . There aren't any details available about exactly how Mitsubishi proposes to achieve the AI mind-meld, though \u2014 so this concept is largely just that: an idea. We'll take the Knight Rider experience sooner than later if we can though, please. .

V Nigerian lawmakers have called on the government to declare a state of emergency for the country\u2019s crumbling roads to tackle decades of infrastructural decay that has limited economic growth. Though Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest energy producer, the dire state of its roads has long held back the economy\u2019s potential, economists say. In a vote on Thursday, the House of Representatives noted \u201cthe failure of successive administrations to prioritise road construction and maintenance,\u201d leaving major routes in \u201cvarious states of disrepair\u201d. President Muhammadu Buhari's administration has said it aims to diversify the economy away from oil, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of government revenues. That includes plans to spend heavily on infrastructure as part of a record 2017 budget, though economists say capital expenditure for the year is lower than expected so far. \u201cNigeria\u2019s whole challenge right now is trying to reduce the dependence on oil and that means unlocking the potential of almost every Nigerian state,\u201d said John Ashbourne, Africa analyst at Capital Economics. \u201cHolding them back is that getting anything from inland to market is incredibly time-consuming and expensive.\u201d. The government does not dispute that Nigeria\u2019s roads are in poor condition and on Thursday said it had set up a tax relief scheme for road-building firms to help address the issue. But Buhari\u2019s administration has not followed through with its spending plans for infrastructure. About one-tenth of the amount budgeted for capital projects between January and July 2017 was spent for that purpose, two-thirds less than during the same period in 2016, according to Capital Economics. The current state of infrastructure puts the Buhari government\u2019s plans, including ambitions to turn Nigeria into a manufacturing hub and for the agriculture sector to fuel economic growth, at risk, economists say.

VLouisiana siblings Matthew and Ebony Nicole Sonnier were arrested for first-degree murder. A brother and sister from Louisiana have been charged with murder in the deaths of three people found in two different locations. Matthew Sonnier, 29, and Ebony Nicole Sonnier, 31, were arrested on first-degree murder charges in the deaths of two men whose burned bodies were discovered in Rapides Parish. Authorities said on Thursday (26 October) they found the remains of 33-year-old Kendrick Dwann Horn and 28-year-old Jeremy Deon Norris from Alexandria when extinguishing a fire in a roadside ditch last week, The Associated Press reported. The siblings also face first-degree murder charges in the stabbing death of Latish White. The Alexandria woman was found partially clothed in a Pineville road around three hours before Horn and Norris' burned bodies were discovered. Matthew Sonnier was a "known acquaintance" of White, authorities said. Rapides Parish Sheriff William Earl Hilton did not explain why authorities believed the two cases were connected. "I absolutely don't want to do anything that's going to cause a problem in the future for the prosecution," Hilton told reporters. The Sonniers, of Alexandria, were arrested on Wednesday (25 October). Pineville deputy police chief, Darrell Basco, said Matthew was initially arrested on a second-degree murder charge in White's death, while Ebony was arrested on drug charges. Hilton told reporters that the murder charges come from a "very intense investigation" that led investigators to hundreds of pieces of evidence found at eight different crime scenes. "There are so many different tentacles to this thing that went so many different places," he said. "No one can remember this many different crime scenes that we had to process.". According to KALB, the Sonniers are also charged with two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of criminal conspiracy. Matthew faces an additional charge of carrying a firearm by a convicted felon.

VPPC\u2019s share price leapt, putting it more than 20% above the Fairfax offer, on news the Swiss group will make a formal offer in a few weeks\u2019 time. PPC\u2019s share price jumped 6.5% to R7.07 on Friday morning after Swiss building material group LafargeHolcim emerged as a rival bidder to Fairfax and AfriSam. Both PPC and LafargeHolcim issued statements saying they were in talks regarding a "possible transaction in Africa". "LafargeHolcim intends to submit a firm intention offer during the week commencing November 20, following the completion of a due diligence process," PPC said. LafargeHolcim said it was in talks with PPC\u2019s board "regarding a possible transaction in Africa. PPC is a leading regional cement manufacturer with a presence in southern and eastern Africa.". PPC\u2019s share price rising to R7.07 puts it 23% above the R5.75 offer from Canadian fund manager Fairfax, which is dependent on PPC agreeing to merge with AfriSam. PPC said its independent board would consider Fairfax\u2019s and AfriSam\u2019s offer concurrently with LafargeHolcim\u2019s offer. "PPC shareholders are advised that PPC has received a nonbinding expression of interest from LafargeHolcim, which contemplates a combination of certain African assets, a partial cash offer and a special dividend," PPC said on Friday. On October 6, Nigerian cement maker Dangote announced it was dropping out of the bidding war for PPC.

VThe average age of a first-time driver is about 16-years-old. Your first few times behind the wheel are with an instructor who has just enough control of the vehicle to prevent accidents. After a certain amount of sessions, you\u2019re ready to pass a driving test \u2014 and even after that, you\u2019re not prepared enough to drive on busy roads all by yourself. But one 11-year-old boy got a little test of the road very early, and without proper supervision. In the boy\u2019s defense, it wasn\u2019t his fault that he found himself behind the wheel \u2014 it was his uncle\u2019s. Cops pulled over an erratic Honda after other drivers called 911 about the driver. The boy was in the driver\u2019s seat, sitting on a pile of clothes, which was necessary for him to see over the wheel. Next to him was his intoxicated uncle, 29-year-old Genoro Lopez. Cops asked the child why he was driving, and he answered that he was learning. Then he revealed the truth: his uncle wanted to avoid a DUI, so he got the pre-teen behind the wheel instead. But that wasn\u2019t the only crime Genoro was guilty of: he also didn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license. The man was arrested and charged with felony child endangerment and for having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. More Stories from LittleThings.

VApple's CarPlay infotainment system is finally coming to vehicles with two wheels. . Honda's new 2018 Gold Wing will be the first motorcycle in the world to have Apple CarPlay integration, according to CNET. The bike has a 7-inch LED screen on its handlebar dashboard, giving bikers a platform to control Maps, music, and more for an onscreen Apple experience that's been available on four wheels since 2014. Apple insisted on a few extra safeguards to bring CarPlay to the bike. The connection isn't wireless \u2014 a feature that's still rare for CarPlay-enabled vehicles of any type \u2014 so users have to plug their iPhone into one of the motorcycle's USB ports, which are in the trunk and the tank's storage cubby. . The CarPlay setup on the Gold Wing's screen. A separate Bluetooth device with a microphone is also required for the CarPlay functionality, so riders will need a pair of wireless headphones in order to use it. Google declined to include support for its own smartphone-connected infotainment system, Android Auto, according to the report. The Gold Wing's LCD screen doesn't have touch functionality, so riders have to depend on a panel on the motorcycle's tank or a four-way pad on the left handlebar to control their infotainment center on the road. That's much safer than fiddling on a phone while riding, which could be why Apple's finally bringing the platform to motorcycles. . The Gold Wing has a base price of $23,500 and hits the streets next February. It also offers a liquid-cooled six-cylinder engine, adaptive suspension, and a smart key. Your car might not have CarPlay, but your next motorcycle might. .

V Saraki leaving his Code of Conduct TribunalA body of Nigerian student activists, under the umbrella of the Alliance Of Nigerian Students Against Neoliberal Attacks (ANSA), on Thursday called on the National Human Rights Commission to urgently intervene in last month's attacks on innocent citizens in Ilorin by policemen and thugs loyal to Senate President Bukola Saraki.In a letter addressed to the Director-General of the commission in Abuja, the group, which comprises student activists from various tertiary institutions described the physical attack and harassment on September 22, by policemen of the Kwara Police Command and thugs upon student activists and journalists who went to observe the proceedings in the legal matter between Mr. Saraki and SaharaReporters Publisher Omoyele Sowore.'On the said date, members of our organization who came from far and near to observe the court proceedings were beaten up by armed thugs loyal to Senator Saraki with the active support of police officers,' ANSA recalled. 'This brazen attack was taken beyond proportion as a female activist, Funmi Ajayi was stripped and her clothes torn after being heavily pounced on by these sponsored thugs of a lawmaker.They said journalists were also beaten by the thugs and forced to delete footage of the event or risk being killed.'It is on record that Olajuwon Sanyaolu, our National Coordinator alongside other activists, after being beaten by these armed thugs, was arbitrarily arrested at the Court premises and detained at the Kwara State Police Command Headquarters by the Police officers working with the thugs at the Court premises,' adding that he was subsequently released due to due to several agitations which arose immediately following the arrest.''We see this act of impunity as a serious rape of human rights, our democracy and the rule of law,' the petition said. 'We are calling on your esteemed office to urgently intervene in the high-handedness and violation of democratic principles by Senator Bukola Saraki, the Senate President who has turned himself to a tyrant of a sort, trampling on fundamental rights of innocent citizens.'The statement was signed by Mr. Sanyaolu, National Secretary Femi Adeyeye, and National Public Relations Officer Oseriemen Patrick.Saraki leaving his Code of Conduct TribunalSahara Reporters MediaEducationHuman RightsScandalNewsAddThis:Original Author:Sahara Reporters, New YorkDisable advertisements: .

VCOPS face fresh fury as it emerged arrests have halved in a decade. It comes after a string of police PR stunts. Two police officers in fancy dress caused concerns about how forces are using their time and resources. Stats buried in a Home Office release yesterday revealed cops made 779,660 arrests in England and Wales in the year to April. A decade ago there were almost 1.5million arrests. The 2016/17 figures are down 12 per cent on the previous year \u2014 despite a 13 per cent surge in recorded crime. Cops were blasted this month for painting their nails to highlight slavery. Others rode dodgems and dressed as teddy bears. The Met has also stopped probing crimes such as burglaries to save £400million. This police officer went for a dazzling blue shade when deciding what colour to paint his nails. Humberside Police use up their spare time to have a go on fairground dodgems, seen here earlier this month. The Sun was first to report on police make-up 'gimmicks' used to highlight slavery. Latest figures show that crime is rising but arrests are falling. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThe police will be concerned that PR operations are not dealing with crime but dealing with stunts.\u201d. The Home Office said arrests were just \u201cone of the powers police possess\u201d, and highlighted a rise in \u201cvoluntary attendance\u201d at stations.

VGas pipeline major APA Group has backed the federal government's recently announced National Energy Guarantee, saying the scheme will increase the use of gas in Australia's energy mix. APA managing director Mick McCormack told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting the new policy is a step in the right direction. 'I was pleased to see the Prime Minister's announcement regarding the NEG, which included gas as one of the ready-to-use and reliable sources of dispatchable energy that retailers can access to meet reliability and emissions guarantees,' Mr McCormack said on Friday. The Turnbull government earlier this month unveiled the NEG scheme, under which energy retailers will be required to meet standards mandated by national regulators on reliability and emissions. Energy companies will need to guarantee both supply and emissions reduction targets in a subsidy-free market, with each retailer free to decide their mix of power to meet the mandated criteria. Mr McCormack said a decade-long lack of energy policy planning and lack of co- operation among state and federal governments had resulted in Australians paying some of the highest energy prices in the world. He said it was now necessary to have policy certainty from a national energy plan that has bipartisan support across all levels of government and all states. If Australia is going to meet its global commitment of reducing emissions by 2030, more gas will be required along with more renewables to take over from coal, Mr McCormack said. Earlier, outgoing chairman Leonard Bleasel reaffirmed full-year guidance for earnings to be between $1.475 billion to $1.510 billion, and said APA continued to see opportunities ahead for growth. He also told shareholders the company has opened a small office in Houston, Texas in recent months as it considers opportunities outside Australia. APA in August said it was looking at acquisition opportunities in the North American gas pipeline market, with many US pipeline assets now in need of recapitalisation. By 1233 AEDT, APA Group securities were up 0.5 per cent at $8.515 in a firm Australian market.  AAP.

VThe emergence of the economy from recession, improving business environment and stabilizing fiscal and monetary interventions may put banks in good stead to moderate their risks from now through 2018. Afrinvest Securities Limited, in a press conference ahead of the launch of its 2017 Banking Sector Report at the London Stock Exchange this week, said top among the reforms was introduction of the Investors & Exporters\u2019 (I&E) window that has generated great interest and become the preferred market for foreign exchange (forex) transactions by investors. According to the company, the steps being taken to restructure loans to challenged sectors, as well as some of the noticeable improvements in the general commerce and manufacturing sectors, which have been buoyed by improving forex market will be positive for banks and economy. The Group Managing Director, Afrinvest West Africa, Ike Chioke, explained that banks and the economy were predisposed to significant risks, particularly from the forex market, which regulators grappled with, though not without consequences. \u201cThe equities market has witnessed renewed participation from foreign portfolio investors on the back of improved access to foreign exchange. We are of the view that the greatest risk to forex stability remains the sustainability of the NAFEX rate, being the only official market determined rate,\u201d he said. He pointed out that the improvements in the forex market have reignited appetite for Eurobonds\u2019 issuance, with a number of Nigerian banks having raised Eurobonds in 2017- Zenith and UBA, $500 million each, while being highly oversubscribed. Affirming the outlook, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, said the six-month old window has as at September, turned over about $10 billion, which now brought the exchange rate near convergence and calmed speculations. But Chioke reiterated the need for policy consistency and strive to withstand pressures from other government actors in taking decisions that will aid development of monetary policy in the country, noting that regulatory risk remains pronounced in the country. According to him, there are three lessons from the recent episode- need for a wider diversification of government revenue and exports; institutional constraints need to be speedily removed; and urgency in raising investments in infrastructure to boost entrepreneurship and gain competitiveness. He said that debt service obligations present a red flag, but expressed optimism on a possible moderation in 2017 on account of the rebound in oil revenue. \u201cWhile foreign debt obligations are mostly long term multilateral facilities and do not constitute short term risks, policymakers have to be watchful of taking more external leverage without expanding revenue size, given the debt service implication of any future currency devaluation,\u201d he added.

VOct 27, 2017 \u2013 Sidi Ilujinle Yoruba Movie: Tunde Kelani Adapts The Lion And The Jewel Play By Wole Soyinka Into Yoruba Film. Popular Nollywood director and producer Tunde Kelani is currently working on the filming of The Lion and the Jewel, one of the popular plays of the Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka. The movie, to be shot in Ibadan, will see Kelani go back to the down-to-earth indigenous language tradition he started with, as the movie, titled Sidi Ilujinle, will be rendered in Yoruba language. In a chat with our correspondent, the producer popularly called TK says he aims to present a movie that will be entertaining, culturally rich and at the same time educative. This is part of what informed the cast of Sidi Ilujinle, where Adebayo Salami is playing the character, Baroka; Ibrahim Chatta, Lakunle; and Crown Troupe-trained Ayisat Onitiri playing Sidi. He says he has received Soyinka\u2019s nod on the project. \u201cIn fact, I can say that it was Prof. himself (Soyinka) who inspired me to embark on the project. He said, \u2018TK, why not take a look at one of my plays?\u2019 Well, I think he said something like \u2018one of the simple plays\u2019. But when I started to take a closer look at The Lion and the Jewel, trying to break it down, I discovered that it is not as simple as many people think. For one, the play is more of poetry than prose.\u201d. But TK notes that it has, so far, been a very interesting experience. According to him, it is going to give viewers a memorable treat.

But Mitsubishi recently unveiled its slightly different tack at the Tokyo Motor Show. . Mitsubishi's new e-Evolution concept is an all-electric crossover vehicle that promises a stiff dose of AI power. The vehicle doesn't look too far off from another of the Motor Show's all-electric hits, the Nissan IMx concept \u2014 but Mitsubishi isn't embracing full-on autonomy like Nissan. . The concept is powered by three electric motors, which draw power from a battery under the vehicle's floor. Mitsubishi didn't provide horsepower estimates or battery range projections, though, so the design behind the four-wheel drive SUV isn't exactly fully realized. . Mitsubishi's boldest idea for the e-Evolution is plugging an AI assistant directly into the vehicle's interface, like something out of camp classic Knight Rider. The automaker describes the system as a tool that can make the human driver more effective by using sensors "to instantly read changes in road and traffic conditions, as well as the driver's intent." . It doesn't sound anything like the autonomous systems currently being developed by carmakers and tech companies around the world \u2014 Mitsubishi talks up a "special coaching function" that gives the AI system power to "transfer knowledge to the driver" somehow, so the company is definitely imagining a system that won't take the driver out of the equation. . There aren't any details available about exactly how Mitsubishi proposes to achieve the AI mind-meld, though \u2014 so this concept is largely just that: an idea. We'll take the Knight Rider experience sooner than later if we can though, please. .

V This article originally appeared on People. For more stories like this, visit people.com. . Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s romance may have been two years in the making!. In a Channel 4 documentary set to air Friday in the U.K., royal expert Katie Nicholl claims that the prince described the Suits star as his \u201cideal girl\u201d two years before they met last year. \u201cHe had a crush on [Markle\u2019s character] Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends,\u201d Nicholl says in the documentary, When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance. \u201cShe told me she\u2019d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, \u2018Harry, who\u2019s your ideal girl?\u2019 And he said \u2018Meghan Markle from Suits.\u2019 \u201d. The L.A.-born actress began starring in the USA Network legal drama in 2011 and is currently filming the eighth season in her adopted hometown of Toronto. . The couple, who met July 2016, made their public debut as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto, where they held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with her mom, Doria. Before the games, Markle had spoken in a way that no other royal girlfriend or boyfriend had done so before, saying they were \u201ctwo people who are really happy and in love.\u201d. According to reports, the couple recently visited Buckingham Palace for a private tea with Harry\u2019s grandmother Queen Elizabeth. Spokespeople at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report. There is critical significance in Markle\u2019s meeting with the Queen. Harry is fifth in the line of succession (he\u2019ll be pushed to sixth after William and Kate welcome their third baby this spring), meaning he has to have the monarch\u2019s permission to wed. There had been rumors that the Suits star and the Queen may have met earlier\u2014during a visit to Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And if there is any doubt that Harry would need to worry about securing his grandmother\u2019s approval, one inside source tells People he would be in the clear. \u201cIf Harry asks for something, she would say yes as she adores him,\u201d the source says.

VCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson insists their Carabao Cup thrashing by Bristol City will be a one-off. Palace are bottom of the league after just one win from their opening nine games. "The defeat sounds a lot worse than it really should have been," Hodgson insisted. "When a team has five shots on goal you don't expect them to score four. "You also don't expect to give away at least two of the four in the manner we gave them away. That won't happen again. "The players who made the mistakes are upset but they were human errors. Tactically the way we approached the game actually wasn't that bad. "The statistics will prove that but it was a heavy defeat and it's one which we are all very unhappy with. "And in particular because 2,000 fans travelled to Bristol and as a manager when you make a lot of changes you feel a lot of responsibility for that. "They are entitled to be upset and you as a manager you feel responsibility for that.".

VThe official residence of the District Chief Executive (DCE) for Bole, Madam Alele Veronica Heming was on Thursday afternoon burgled by some unscrupulous persons. The suspected criminals broke into the house through the back window while she was at the office according to police investigators, ransacked rooms in the house and later made away with her towel, panties, bathing soap, sponge and other items. It is gathered that loaves of bread and stew prepared by the DCE were consumed by the thieves who it is rumored may have stolen the items for ritual purposes. The day security at the DCE\u2019s residence identified as Mallam Abu has since been arrested by the Bole police to assist in their investigations. When reached on phone, Madam Alele Veronica confirmed the burglary to mynewsgh.com but said she could not disclose exactly what had been stolen from her residence but said the police are currently investigating the matter. \u201cI am unable to tell what has been stolen but it is true my home has been burgled. My day watchman has been arrested by the police and assisting in investigations\u201d, she confirmed. Source: mynewsgh.com.

V- A 10-year-old boy stole his mother's boyfriend's car. - He drove onto a highway with his mother in hot pursuit in another car. - She called police, who chased him for close to an hour before catching up with him. A daredevil 10-year-old boy engaged police in a high speed car chase on Thursday, October 26 because he was bored. The boy, from Cleveland, Ohio in the US, reportedly stole his mother's boyfriend's car and drove onto a highway with his mother in hot pursuit in another car. The mother called the police, who then chased the boy for close to an hour and for more than 70km. Incredibly, he reached speeds of up to 154kph. The boy drove off-road to avoid spikes put by police on the highway. Photo: YouTube/Cleveland.com. A police dashboard camera caught part of the chase on video. The boy is seen driving off-road, where he had earlier turned to avoid spikes police had put on the highway. He was finally boxed in after a police car hit the side of his car, causing it to turn sharply to the left. Police immediately arrested him, although he reportedly kicked and spat at them. Police caught up with him and boxed his car in. Photo: YouTube/Cleveland.com. His mother arrived soon afterwards and asked him: "Why did you do this when I kept trying to get you to stop? You could have got killed.". Fortunately, no one was injured in the chase. The boy later told officers that he took the car because he was bored. Police immediately arrested him.

VZachary Levi at the Thor: The Dark World premiere in 2013. Get ready to meet DC's newest silver-screen superhero. Zachary Levi has just been set to lead Shazam!, the next entry in the DC cinematic universe. . Mashable has confirmed the news, which was first broken by The Hollywood Reporter. The trade reports that Levi beat out contenders like John Cena and Jake McDorman to clinch the role. Shazam! centers on a boy named Billy Batson, who is gifted with the ability to transform into a grown-up superhero by uttering the word "shazam." Levi will play the adult version of the character. Worth noting: This is a separate project from the Black Adam movie currently being developed for Dwayne Johnson, even though the characters are frequently connected in the comics. David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) is set to direct the Shazam! film. Shooting will begin in February 2018. While no release date has officially been announced, we're guessing it'll slide into one of the 2019 slots that Warner Bros. already has set aside for its DC titles. Ironically, the news comes just as Levi prepares to return to cinemas in another superhero movie, this one from DC competitor Marvel \u2013 he reprises the role of Fandral in next month's Thor: Ragnarok. Fun fact: In DC Comics canon, the adult version of Batson's hero was previously known as Captain Marvel, who has been in circulation since 1939. Since DC's competitor, Marvel, is currently developing an MCU movie around a character that they also named Captain Marvel (aka Carol Danvers), it seems likely that DC will ditch that aspect of Batson's history and lean into "Shazam" instead \u2014 they officially renamed the character in 2011. .

V'Tis the season... to be scalping!. Just hours after Apple's iPhone X went up for pre-order around the world, some asshole has already listed the hard-to-get-your-hands-on "all-screen" device for a whopping $59,999 on eBay. Screw this guy. But also screw anyone who's stupid and desperate enough to buy it from him. Look, I take no joy in calling anyone an asshole, but when you're scalping an iPhone X at a 5,117 percent mark up. Screw you, man. I understand that it's simple supply and demand, and some of these sellers are legitimately just trying to make a living, and it's just simple business. . But seriously, what the hell, man? . The device up for sale is a 256GB model that sells for $1,150. Don't be that idiot who pays this ridiculous price. It's not worth it. Need another reason? The seller can't even guarantee you'll get the iPhone X on launch day on Nov. 3. Estimated delivery time is between Oct. 30 (impossible unless they get it early somehow) and Nov. 13. Worse, the screenshot of the pre-ordered iPhone X shows a delivery date of Nov. 17-24. . Screw that. On that note, don't pay markup prices at all from anywhere. You're better than that. Don't fall for it. It's just a new iPhone. Relax and breathe. It's not the end of the world if you don't have one. And if anyone, like your significant other tells you otherwise, dump their ass.

VPool Photo. Workers in the oil and gas sector on Friday alleged that the huge loss of revenue and investments in the country was due to delay in the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). The workers under the aegis of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) stated this in a communique at the end of its National Executive Council meeting. The communiqué was signed by Francis Olabode Johnson, PENGASSAN President and its General Secretary, Lumumba Okugbawa in Lagos. The workers commended the National Assembly\u2019s efforts to pass the Bill, adding that more effort should be made to ensure it was passed. \u201cThe stakeholders (oil workers) will ensure that the lacunas, particularly the adverse labour clauses identified in the Bill are addressed before its passage,\u2019\u2019 it said. The association condemned the continuous vandalism on pipelines adding that the unfortunate development had caused incalculable economic damage in the sector. It said that there was the need to create strong security strategies and use of modern equipment to end unnecessary attacks and damaging of nation\u2019s assets. \u201cWe acknowledge efforts of the government to rehabilitate the nation\u2019s refineries, which are in appalling state for optimal delivery. \u201cWe urge the government to give priority to Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) in all the four state-owned refineries as well as rehabilitate depots, jetties, tank farms, pipelines and pump stations,\u2019\u2019 it said. It said that rehabilitating the depots would ease supply of crude oil to the refineries as well as the evacuation and distribution of refined products nationwide. The worker also decried the anti-union posture by indigenous oil and gas companies and marginal field operators and resolved to resist any management that infringes on the workers\u2019 Rights to Freedom of Association and Lawful Assembly. It called on regulatory institutions and business partners (Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources (DPR) NNPC/NAPIMS, International Oil Companies (IOCs), Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment to call such companies to order. The workers urged the government to embark on a number of coordinated steps to resolve some of the problems bedeviling the oil and gas industry. Get more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook.

VPEP GUARDIOLA is looking to take his Manchester City stars on a warm-weather training break in the New Year, it can be revealed. The City boss is worried his squad have been travelling huge distances for World Cup qualifiers so far this season. Manchester City's players seem likely to have a warm-weather break after regular long trips for World Cup qualifiers and Champions League games this season. Guardiola's men will have also headed out to Napoli and Shakhtar Dometsk in the Champions League group stages by then. He is already fearful his stars could burn out as they battle for the Premier League title. And it is understood a short spell in Abu Dhabi would be the preferred option, as a trip can be arranged on short notice. An Etihad source said: "Pep may look again at some warm-weather training early in the New Year. Pep Guardiola hopes a New year trip to the sun can refresh his Man City players. Man City aces John Stones and Raheem Sterling helped England to the World Cup finals in Russia next year - including making long trips to teams like Lithuania. "The club are conscious a lot of the squad have also been travelling big distances for World Cup qualifiers. "There are also trips in the Champions League to Napoli and Shakhtar Donetsk to contend with. "The backroom staff are keeping a close watch on fatigue and Abu Dhabi would again seem the easiest to arrange.".

VHonda showed off a slick new Sports EV concept at the Tokyo Motor Show earlier this week, but the automaker's most charming future-forward design to debut at the event isn't something you'll ever take for a drive. . The Japanese company unveiled the RoboCas concept, an all-electric, self-driving cargo robot that looks like the offspring of the bot couple from Disney's WALL-E. Just take a look at the family resemblance:. I mean, just look at this thing. There's not a ton of information about the RoboCas concept in terms of specs, so we don't know how long its battery might last or what type of system enables the self-driving functionality beyond a reference to "Honda's autonomous mobility technology." Honda instead described the bot as a companion that was "born to make each person\u2019s ideas and dreams come true.". The RoboCas concept is similar to other autonomous machines from companies like Vespa-maker Piaggio, which makes a companion cargo bot on wheels called the Gita. Postmates and DoorDash started using wheeled machines from Starship Technologies in pilot programs for self-driving deliveries back in January, sending the robots out on the streets of Washington, D.C. and Redwood City, California, respectively. This might be too cute. Honda's concept looks to be more sophisticated than the delivery bots, but the automaker didn't announce any plans for wide-scale production. You'll have to wait to play out your wildest WALL-E fantasies until the design is green-lit beyond concept status. .

VPresident Muhammadu Buhari.  President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday apologised to members of the National Assembly who were denied access to the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Trouble began when the principal officers of the National Assembly who were scheduled to attend a dinner at the Presidential Banquet Hall on the invitation of President Buhari were denied access to the venue by operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) mounting the pilot gate leading to the villa. . Apparently irked by what they considered an affront, the lawmakers, who were led in a convoy by the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara turned back in protest. . Details were not immediately made available, but sources at the gate said trouble started when the security agents insisted on profiling and subjecting them to thorough screening because they did not have clearance.It was learnt that some of the security operatives were also not courteous to the lawmakers when they arrived on a bus but without the necessary clearance. Although Saraki and Dogara were allowed access, being presiding officers and because they already had gate passes, the other principal officers of the two \u200echambers, it was further gathered, felt humiliated and decided to turn back from the gate since they did not have gate passes. President Buhari who later met with Saraki and Dogara as well as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the duo of Ita Enang and Suleiman Kawu, both advisers to the President on National Assembly matters at his residence, apologised for the embarrassment at the pilot gate. . The Guardian learnt that the dinner has been rescheduled to take place in the villa on Tuesday next week, while the president has instructed that gate passes be given to all principal officers of the National Assembly. .

V- Vehicle Inspection Officer (VIO) has reportedly forced a taxi driver to crash into a restaurant in Abuja. - The unnamed officer was said to have dragged the steering wheel with the taxi driver on motion. - The driver who tried to escape the arrest crashed his vehicle into the restaurant. The Jabi area of Abuja was on Thursday, October 26, thrown into confusion when customers at a Bigg\u2019s restaurant fled for safety after an errant Vehicle Inspection Officer (VIO) crashed its car into the venue. Guardian reports that an eyewitness said an unnamed officer was dragging the steering wheel with a taxi driver, who was escaping arrest until the vehicle crashed into the building. The car, with registration number ABJ 189 XD, which had a lady at the passenger seat, crashed into the restaurant, which is along Awolowo Way, injuring the lady and some staff of the restaurant. . The officer, who had stopped the driver around airport junction, about 2km from the site of the incident, was said to have forced his way into the driver side of the vehicle and struggled with the steering until it rammed into the building. The vehicle shattered the glass entrance of the restaurant, pulled down a standing air conditioner, tables and chairs before a pillar and counter at the centre of the restaurant forced the vehicle to a stop. While the incident attracted a mob, joint task force, which included the police, army, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), stated that Civil Defense invaded the location, harassing people to leave the scene. . The taxi drivers, who complained about the excesses of the VIO officials, had protested against the highhandedness, threatening to lynch the officers. Meanwhile, NAIJ.com had reported that the VIO officials had been tasked to ensure that only roadworthy vehicles are allowed on roads. Joe Abah, the director-general, Bureau of Public Service Reforms, has revealed an interesting memo that will stop drivers from being harassed unjustly.

VAttorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami is said to be delaying request by Nigeria Port Authority (NPA) on whether to continue relationship with a Swiss firm convicted for spending $20m in bribing NPA officials. Recall that Dredging International (Cyprus), a Swiss firm was indicted, charged and convicted for giving a $20m bribe to NPA officials for certain approvals during the period of the last contract. During the trial in Switzerland, the firm argued that it gave out the bribe because that is the only way it can get approval from the NPA. Though the indicted officials of the NPA had gone to court to challenge their involvement, in a recent media chat, the managing director of the NPA, Hadiza Usman revealed that the affected NPA staff had been placed on suspension pending the end of the substantive suit. According to her, checks by her on the said approvals for which the bribe was given showed that there were real delays within the period of the approval which goes to show that something like waiting for the bribe may have been responsible for the long delay noticed in the memo concerned. At that briefing, she averred that just as NPA was guided by AGF\u2019s advise in suspending the contract of Intels Nigeria Limited in pilotage, NPA would equally be guided on whatever Malami advises on the be in the Dredging International issue. Trouble had started at the verge of renewing the contract with the Swiss firm when it was discovered that the same company had been indicted for international bribery in Nigeria at NPA. Meanwhile, activists and civil groups including the Civil Society Network Against Corruption (CSNAC) has joined in the campaign against the renewal of the contract and immediate prosecution of all named officials of the federal agency in the scandal. The group further warned the AGF not to give any contrary advice to NPA that will amount to tarnishing the nation\u2019s already battered image on corruption prevalence. A statement by CSNAC Chairman, Mr. Olanrewaju Suraju, questioned the rationale behind the legal advice when the company had already been convicted in Switzerland since 2012. CSNAC recalled that \u201cNigeria sanctioned Halliburton and Siemens in the past for their roles in bribery cases and prevented them from participating in contract implementation. It is curious how the NPA is framing excuses for purported involvement of the indicted company in the bidding process for the new dredging contract\u201d. According to the rights group, \u201cThe action runs contrary to the anti-corruption mantra of this government and is capable of sending a wrong signal of endorsing bribery to the international community.\u201d.

VHINDUS are celebrating Chhath Puja which is takes place this week. But what is the festival about and how long does it last for?. Chhath Puja is one of the religious festivals of India. When is Chhath Puja 2017?. Chhath Puja is one of the religious festivals of India which is dedicated to the Lord Shiva, one of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. The event stretches across four days of worship, and runs from October 24 to 27 this year. During the festival, fasting is observed by women for the well-being of their sons and family members. What happens during Chhath Puja?. The festival is split across four days, with each having activities and traditions:. Day one - Nahay Khay \u2013 devotees dip in water and women take a single meal. Day two \u2013 Kharna \u2013 fasting takes place from sunrise to the sunset, with the fast breaking after dark. Day three - Sanjhiya Gha \u2013 a fast is observed and devotees offer worship to the setting sun. Day four - Usha Argya \u2013 the fast is broken and worship is offered to the rising sun. The festival is split across four days, with each having activities and traditions revolving around praying to the sun god. Why is the god of energy celebrated?. Hindus use the festival to thank the sun for blessing the earth and providing life. It can also be a time to request the granting of certain wishes, and prayers will be offered up to The Jeet, who is considered as the god of energy and of the life-force. Typically the festival is observed by Nepalis and Indian people. Hindus use the festival to thank the sun for blessing the earth and providing life. Why do Hindus believe the sun cures diseases?. According to Hindus, the rays of the rising sun are extremely important and have healing properties and can ensure the longevity of family members, friends, and elders. In one of the matras of the holy text Atharvaveda is that the rising sun destroys all causes of death and disease. As a result of their belief, they will pray in the morning with their faces towards the east so rays fall on their chests.  Queen visits Hindu school . More in holidays and religious festivals.

V(File photo). Maputo \u2014 Edith Cylindo, one of those charged with the assassination of prosecutor Marcelino Vilanculos, on Thursday, the second day of her trial in the southern city of Matola, denied that she had anything to do with the killing. Journalists were barred from covering the trial on its first day, but the Maputo daily \u201cNoticias\u201d managed to cover the second day's events. Cylindo told the court that she had no person motive for joining the group that murdered Vilanculos in April 2016. \u201cIt wasn't me who ordered the murder\u201d, she said. \u201cI'm not the material author of this crime and I never had any interest in his assassination. I don't know why they are involving me in this matter\u201d. The judge, Samuel Pedro Artur, reminded Cylindo of her statements during the preliminary investigations. Then she admitted spying on Vilanculos for the death squad that killed him. She had followed him from his office in Maputo City to his home in Matola. According to the prosecution, she had taken photographs of Vilanculos and had given them to another of the murderers, Jose Ali Coutinho, for purposes of identifying the victim. Cylindo now denied her earlier statements. She said she had been coerced into making them by members of the riot police. The prosecution noted that more than 2.2 million meticais (about 36,000 US dollars) was deposited in her bank accounts precisely at the time when she was allegedly spying on Vilanculos, between 29 March and 11 April 2016. Of this sum, a million meticais was deposited on 11 April, the date of the murder. Cylindo, who is a jurist who has worked in commercial banks, and in the Maputo City Financial Directorate, claimed that the money resulted from her own businesses, which included selling clothes, renting out a house belonging to her father in the northern city of Pemba, advising a mining company, foreign exchange dealings and loansharking (the latter two activities are clearly illegal). The trial has been adjourned and the judge has not yet set a date for resuming it.

V Jürgen Klopp today reported good progress is being made in the rehabilitation programmes of longer-term absentees Adam Lallana, Sadio Mane and Nathaniel Clyne. . The manager expects Lallana and Mane to be closing in on returns to action following the completion of the forthcoming November international break. Asked about how the trio\u2019s recoveries are coming along, Klopp told his pre-match press conference at Melwood: \u201cVery good, but no option for tomorrow, no option for Wednesday and no option for West Ham. \u201cAfter the international break, I think Adam and Sadio are back. It will be close, so hopefully they can train during the international break and be part of the normal training. \u201cAdam was this week, for the first time, part of the warming up. His face showed how happy he was about this!. \u201cI saw in the last hour them both with the fitness coaches on the pitch doing technical things and stuff like this, so it all looks good. \u201cIn the end they all need to be at 100 per cent and they aren\u2019t at the moment, so that\u2019s it \u2013 but they\u2019re on a good way.\u201d. Lallana and Clyne have not featured for Liverpool so far in 2017-18 due to thigh and back injuries respectively. Mane, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t figured since the Reds\u2019 draw at Newcastle on October 1 after sustaining a hamstring issue while on international duty.

VPaul Zimmerman/WireImage; Desiree Navarro/WireImage. Broken hairbrushes, hair-ties, and spending way too much time with your blow dryer are all everyday struggles when you have thick hair. Depending on who you're asking, having too much hair isn't necessarily a bad thing but it can really start to weigh you down\u2014especially if you don't have a haircut that works with rather than against thick hair. "There are many modern ways to work around thick hair including under-cutting, splicing, removing the interiors, or even keratin treatments to give hair the smooth, natural look," explains celebrity hairstylist David Mallett. What cuts should you avoid if you have thick hair? Mallett says that over-layering, too-blunt ends can look outdated or result in a "pyramid" shape. Whether you want to go short or keep your longer length, we turned to Mallett to find out the best haircuts for thick hair. VIDEO: The Crazy Cost of a Lifetime of Beauty . Mike Marsland/BFC/Getty Images.  1.  Alexa Chung . If you want to rock a fringe, Mallett recommends a soft, 1960's-inspired curtain bangs like Chung's. "Forget anything too square and too thick, which might end up too wig-like and old-fashioned," he explains. . Emma McIntyre/Getty Images.  2.  January Jones . While an overly-layered, shaggy cut can easily look dated, keeping the weight up top and removing it from the bottom on medium to long lengths can lighten up thick hair in a flattering way. . John Shearer/Getty Images.  3.  Selena Gomez . The hottest haircut of the year works well on thick hair, too. Mallet says that a plunging version that is thinned on the ends is the best bet for someone who has full hair. . Paul Zimmerman/WireImage.  4.  Sofia Vergara . If you prefer your bangs more full, opt for a piece-y finish with soft ends like Vergara's so that your fringe doesn't look too heavy. . Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic.  5.  Rosie-Huntington Whiteley . While the lob may be universally flattering for every face shape and hair type, if your strands are thick, Mallett says to ask your stylist to thin it out at the ends. . Desiree Navarro/WireImage.  6.  Jenna Dewan Tatum . Dying to take your lob up a few inches into a bob? Mallett suggests a bob with an undercut to keep the style from having a "pyramid shape," which can easily happen with thick hair. . Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.  7.  Cindy Crawford . Another example of how to do long, thick hair right: Crawford's face-framing layers. Keep yours minimal and up top and ask your stylist to remove the weight from underneath. .

Jackie Stewart is ready to give up his record as Britain\u2019s most successful Formula One racing driver to Lewis Hamilton this weekend -\u2013 but will continue to claim he is the top racer from Scotland. .  The three-time champion, who led a safety crusade in the sport during his halcyon years as a top driver in the late 1960s and early 1970s, admitted his long-held record was there to be beaten.  \u201cRecords are made to be broken,\u201d he said on Friday on the sidelines of the Mexican Grand Prix. .  \u201cI\u2019ve gone 44 years with my record as the winningest British driver and Lewis will win it because he has done such a good job.  \u201cHe will have won four championships, yes, but I will still have got the record because I am Scottish!\u201d.  Stewart also told Sky Sports F1 that he did not feel qualifying speed, or totals of pole positions, were useful to help evaluate different drivers across long periods of time.  \u201cIn the past, qualifying lap times were not that important and in my day we used to have four cars on the front row, of the grid, side by side, three in Monaco.  \u201cI think I won only 17 pole positions in my career, but Ken Tyrrell always wanted the car to be good for a race distance and for us to make a good start. It was a different attitude then.\u201d.

VGrid. Lewis Hamilton took another step towards to a fourth world title after winning the United States Grand Prix last weekend. The Mercedes driver is 66 points clear of Vettel, who finished second, with 75 points available in the remaining three races. The champagne is on ice. While Hamilton overcame Vettel in the end in Austin, he was overtaken by the Ferrari driver at the start of the race. Hamilton didn\u2019t panic, though, and pursued Vettel for the next five laps before overtaking him on turn 12 on lap six to re-take the lead - a lead he managed to hold onto. While the rest of the race was nigh-on faultless, Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have been too happy with his start. And the Brit may have something else to think about when it comes to starting races very soon. That\u2019s because, according to Bild, Formula One are planning a drastic change to the starting grid. Liberty Media have proposed that cars should start in an alternating three-two-three-two formation - rather than the two-by-two pattern. The new grid is planned to create a bigger funnel of activity as the pack enters the first turn. Marca claim that Formula One Group - which Liberty Media recently brought from Bernie Ecclestone, are ready to implement these changes. Here is what the Austin Grand Prix starting grid would have looked like under the new formation:. However, there is opposition from the teams. They believe there is a greater risk of crashes and injuries with the proposed format. And with some narrow tracks such as Monaco, the new plan will be extremely difficult to implement. Whether or not the plans will be seen next season remains to be seen but it's certainly an interesting idea.

VIf you snagged a pre-order reservation for the iPhone X this morning, a quick word of advice: be extra careful with that shiny new OLED screen once you finally get your hands on the phone. Fixing it will cost you. A lot. . Apple released the new non-warranty service cost information on its site this morning, where it was spotted by MacRumors. The number should give clumsy iPhone owners yet another reason to invest in a heavy duty case for their new premium smartphone: Repairing damage to the iPhone X's screen alone will cost U.S. customers $279, while "Other damage" fees for accidents cost you $549. . You read that right. Apple is charging the equivalent of a brand new iPhone 7, which people are reportedly still enthusiastically buying, to fix up a busted iPhone X. . AppleCare+ is the only thing that will save you from shelling out hundreds of dollars to fix up a thrashed phone. The Apple insurance plan for the iPhone X costs $199 for two years of service and covers two incidents of "accidental damage" at dramatically reduced rates. Each screen repair is $29, while "other damage" costs $99. The high costs make AppleCare+ even more attractive, and Apple's fight to keep "right to repair" bills off the books all the more frustrating. iPhone X customers are already paying at least a $999 base price for their brand new phone \u2014 and unless they pony up and extra $200 for AppleCare+, a busted screen could wind up costing them even more in the future. .

VInternational Evangelist and Economist Dr Lawrence Tetteh has endorsed the award-winning Adom Live Worship as the most outstanding gospel program on radio in Ghana right now. He was on a special edition edition of the show, hosted by Kwamena Idan to talk about the secret of his ministry and to pay a tribute to world renowned Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke, who is set to hold his finally crusade in Nigeria next month to complete over 40 years of global evangelistic ministry. Dr. Lawrence led listeners in an electrifying worship and testimonies session as he shared very powerful and inspiring messages of how Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke impacted his personal life and ministry and that of many like him in this generation. He could not but to express his joy for how Adom Live Worship dedicated a whole program to celebrate an Evangelist who has touched and healed many with his Christ for All Nations crusades. With a very genuine and sincere tone, he said \u201cI Lawrence Tetteh I am saying Adom Live Worship is the best gospel program on radio in Ghana today.\u201d. The Founding President of the Worldwide Miracle Outreach urged Ghanaians to continue listening to Adom Live Worship and receive God\u2019s blessings. He thinks Adom Live Worship has touched and changed many lives, and should be put on TV so that it can reach a wider audience in a more intimate way. \u201cI really listen to Adom Live Worship. I Lawrence Tetteh listen to you and I am impressed with the way you go about with the programme. It brings the beauty and glory of God\u2026This is the gospel and I hope it becomes a TV programme one day\u2026\u201d he said. Watch the video below:. Source : Adomonline.com.

V(Reuters) - Bournemouth are not overawed by the prospect of hosting defending champions Chelsea on Saturday because they have grown used to locking horns with Premier League\u2019s elite, defender Charlie Daniels said. . With seven points from nine games this season, Eddie Howe\u2019s team are second-bottom in the table, their worst return at this stage over their three top-flight campaigns. . Bournemouth beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge two years ago and Daniels believes taking points against top teams will be key to their chances of top-flight survival. . \u201dAs a team, we are better prepared. The more we play against the big clubs, the better we are getting,\u201c Daniels told the Daily Echo. \u201dWe are getting more accustomed to it. . \u201dWe go into every game feeling we can get a result and that is the way we have to go about our business. If you are scared of teams and take a step back, you will get beaten anyway. . \u201cIf we can start getting more points against the big sides, that will be important for us and we will feel we are going in the right direction.\u201d . Bournemouth claimed their first points on the road this season with a 2-1 win at Stoke last weekend and Daniels backs his team mates to deliver another spirited performance against Antonio Conte\u2019s Chelsea. . \u201dHopefully, Stoke was the turning point,\u201c he added. \u201dWe needed to pick up points and now we are a lot better off because if we had lost we could have been a few points adrift. . \u201cYou have to be a man, get on with it and roll your socks up. We have beaten Chelsea before and that was down to hard work and graft.\u201d .

VKevin Mirallas is confident Everton will pick up points after their combative 2-1 loss to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. The Toffees gallant effort came two days after their manager, Ronald Koeman, was sacked after a horrible start to the season. Speaking after the match, Mirallas said: "In the second half we had a lot of chances and when you see the players playing like that, with a lot of passion\u2026 I am very happy. "We lost but in the second half we played with more confidence. If we play every game like that we will win a lot of points this season. "We need that, because when you see the league \u2013 that is not Everton. I am not happy with the situation. For the Club, fans and players, we need more \u2013 and that starts on Sunday. "The first half was a little bit difficult but we worked hard. We had a lot of players who had not played much football, which is never easy. . "But we played with passion. That is Everton.".

VSultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar.  Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto. Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, thursday said the agitation for local government autonomy would amount to nothing except leaders are sincere and God-fearing. The monarch made the remark when the National President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Alhaji Ibrahim Khalil, paid him a courtesy call in his palace in Sokoto. According to him, the advocacy for local government autonomy will be a mirage without a change of attitude by leaders at the grassroots. The monarch maintained that unless the leadership fear God and do the right thing, no amount of change in the structure of governance would lead to the attainment of the set objectives. \u201cWe must change the way we handle the affairs of governance, if we are to achieve development in the country.  \u201cIt is not enough to change the system without attitudinal change by leaders. What guarantee do we have that funds will not be embezzled if local government councils are granted autonomy? Therefore, leaders at the grassroots must fear God and be just to the people,\u201d the monarch said. The Sultan reiterated the commitment of the Sultanate Council to any initiative that would bring progress to the country.  In a remark, the National President of NULGE, Ibrahim Khalil, told the monarch that his visit to Sokoto, was in continuation of advocacy campaign on local government autonomy. He noted that the National Assembly had already passed the local government bill, adding that the constitution would not be amended without the approval of two third of the state Houses of Assembly. Khalil posited that none of the state assemblies in the Northwest assented to the bill, hence the agitation by NULGE in the zone. He lamented that the local government system has been bastardised while funds were being diverted at the detriment of rural dwellers.  \u201cWe are here to express our grievances on how local government councils are being mismanaged in Nigeria. We are really concerned because of our closeness to the grassroots. \u201cIt is worrisome that today finances of local government councils are being diverted and people are disconnected from democracy leading to mass poverty, hunger and crime,\u201d Khalil added.

VVitamins are nutrients that have essential functions in the human body, including the release of energy at a cellular level. Like the rest of them, vitamin D has specific jobs in the body, including regulating the body's phosphate and calcium levels and so contributing to dental and bone health. However, according to new research from the Colorado School of Public Health, vitamin D plays an even more vital role to our health, because there are strong indications it can stave off Type 1 Diabetes, the chronic condition usually diagnosed in childhood when the body's production of insulin and ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impaired. This study's findings suggest higher levels of Vitamin D in childhood prevent the immune system from mistakenly attacking insulin-producing, pancreatic cells, and so lessen the development of Type 1 Diabetes in children. Although the study's findings are specific to childhood, it's still vital that you get an adequate amount of vitamin D every day to ensure the health of your teeth and bones. To enrich your diet with vitamin D, stock up on fatty fish like tuna, salmon, and mackerel, beef liver, egg yolks, shiitake mushrooms, and fortified cereals.

VThe date has been set for the suspected billionaire kidnapper, Evans, to know his fate as he faces trial over a murder charge. . Evans. A report by The Nation has shown that a Lagos High Court in Igbosere has adjourned till November 10 for ruling on an application by a suspected billionaire kidnap kingpin Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike alias Evans seeking to quash fresh charges against him. He has asked the court to dismiss proposed twin charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and attempted kidnapping, among others filed against him by the Lagos State Government. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo fixed the date following arguments from Evans and the state counsel. The judge also ordered that three of Evans\u2019 alleged accomplices be moved to Kirikiri Maximum Security Prisons, Ikoyi. Justice Taiwo made the order following an application that one of the suspects requires medical attention which are better available in prison. The suspects, who are on trial on seven counts have been in police custody since their arrest, unlike Evans who was transferred from the police to prison custody following his arraignment before Justice H. Oshodi of a Lagos High Court in Ikeja. Details later\u2026.

Vsaechang/Flickr. In addition to a bag full of free candy, dressing up in a costume this Halloween can also score you a discounted burrito. Fortune reports that Chipotle will be giving anyone who shows up to one of its stores in costume on Halloween a burrito, burrito bowl salad, or taco for just $3. Chipotle notes that orders have to be made in person at the counter, so you can\u2019t make them online, using the mobile app, or via fax (is that a thing people do?). They want to be able to verify you are, in fact, wearing a sweet Halloween costume worthy of the discount. Screenshot: E.Price. That savings is great, but the real prize in the restaurant\u2019s Halloween promotion this year is a \u201cBurritos for a Year\u201d sweepstakes. For that, you have to text \u2018BOORITO\u2019 or \u2018SPOOKY\u2019 to 888222 before the end of the day October 31st. From all its mobile entries, Chipotle will select one winner to receive 52 \u201cfree burrito cards\u201d to get a free burrito each week up to a $10 value.

VManchester United have been bereft of the services of a number of key players this season. After losing Zlatan Ibrahimovic to a knee injury late last season, the Red Devils subsequently lost Paul Pogba to a hamstring injury earlier this season. The flamboyant Frenchman was named the captain of the side against Basel in the UEFA Champions League on the 12th of September but was forced to limp off well within the first half. However, latest reports from the Daily Star (via Sportskeeda) suggest that Pogba could finally make a return in the clash against Chelsea on the 5th of November. Pogba was initially set to be sidelined for a period of about 6-8 weeks, with manager Jose Mourinho repeatedly refusing to commit to a return date. Several .   rumours  .  from across Europe had claimed that Pogba would only return in December. The Frenchman was then sent away on holiday, to recuperate, by manager Jose Mourinho. Having spent the last few weeks in the United States of America, the 24-year old has finally returned to Manchester and is expected to complete his recovery at United's Carrington Complex. .

VThe robbers had a specialty, police say: CVS stores. Their latest heist happened late Thursday night at a CVS in the District\u2019s Tenleytown neighborhood near the Metro station on Wisconsin Avenue NW. But this time, police say, they were caught. D.C. police said the trio was arrested and charged with armed robbery. They are believed to have been involved in at least five other incidents at CVS stores over the last three months in the Northwest Washington area, authorities said. In the incident on Thursday, two men went into the CVS at Tenleytown and forced an employee to the back of the store. They demanded that the store safe be opened. The men then stole money \u2014 how much was not disclosed by police \u2014 and fled in a vehicle that was waiting outside and being driven by another man. . Police said they later arrested the three men, and found the money and some handguns. The men are believed by police to be connected with CVS robberies, including stores along Georgia Avenue in the Brightwood neighborhood, Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown area, 7th Street NW in Shaw and on Pennsylvania Avenue NW near George Washington hospital. It was the second time they\u2019d robbed the CVS at Tenleytown., police said . The suspects are Messan Djlbom, 20, of Silver Spring, Md., Jason White, 31, of Northwest Washington, and Lonnell Hart, 44, of no fixed address. . In another, unrelated incident that happened Wednesday, police said a 7-11 convenience store was robbed in the 200 block of Cedar Street NW near the Takoma Metro stop. The incident unfolded when a man was unloading a truck of supplies and two men came up to him with a gun. One of the men asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the money?\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth getting shot for!\u201d. A surveillance video shows the truck delivery driver unloading a stack of water bottles, then running as the two robbers approach him. Another man blocked him. The three then attacked the driver, wrestling him to the ground, according to a police report. . They tried to take items from his pockets but didn\u2019t get anything, police said. One of the robbers also went into the truck but police said it was not clear what he did inside. The three men then fled north into Takoma Park, Md., police said. Police said they had no description of the men yet. .

VTENS of thousands of wealthy Brits are underpaying tax by at least £10,000 a year, a think tank claims. The Institute of Fiscal Studies said the taxman was checking only one in 70 returns because of cuts. Some £34billion went uncollected last year. The top percentage of earners are burning the biggest hole in HMRC's pockets. More than a third of the unclaimed tax bill comes from under-reporting on self-assessment tax returns. Nearly half of this £8billion missing revenue comes from 144,000 top-earning taxpayers. A fifth of the non-compliant self-assessing taxpayers owe an average of £3,500. Every year 10million people file income tax self-assessments - around a third of all UK taxpayers. HMRC only checks every 1 in 70 Self-Assessment forms due to cuts. Helen Miller, IFS associate director, said: \u201cMost revenue is lost to a relatively small proportion of people who evade large amounts of tax. Evasion is highest for the types of income which are easiest to under-report.\u201d. HMRC spokesman said: \u201cThe majority of self-assessed taxpayers take care to get their tax right.\u201d. It added: \u201cNo one should be in any doubt that HMRC is tackling evasion. \u201cIn the last six years our compliance work has secured more additional tax revenue than ever before.\u201d.

V The search advertising giant brought in $27.8 billion in revenue during the third quarter. . Google Headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google's parent, Alphabet, brought in $27.8 billion in revenue during the third quarter this year, the company reported Thursday. . The advertising behemoth also reported quarterly net income of $9.57 per share. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $21.94 billion and earnings of $8.31 per share. Alphabet shares were trading up nearly 4 percent during after-hours trading on the quarterly beat. . The majority of revenue at Alphabet continues to come from Google properties. Its "other bets" segment, which includes Nest, self-driving cars and other R&D divisions, brought in $302 million in revenue during the quarter, up from $197 million during the same period in 2016. However, that segment lost $812 million during the quarter. . YouTube, which does not get broken out of Google's revenues, got a shout-out on Alphabet's call with investors. CFO Ruth Porat said the streamer's content acquisition costs \u2014 part of its push to compete in the streaming landscape with such originals as Cobra Kai and Impulse \u2014 are contributing to Google's increasing expenses. In the third quarter, Google reported that costs and expenses had grown to $60 billion, up from $47 billion during the same period in 2016. . Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted that people are watching 100 million hours of YouTube from their living rooms each day, up 70 percent in the last year. He also spoke about the growth of YouTube TV, the skinny bundle offering that has been advertised heavily during the World Series. The exec did not disclose subscriber numbers but said that it is now available to two-thirds of all households in the U.S. . Google shares closed the day flat at $972.56. They were trading up more than $31 after-hours to over $1,000 per share. .

VThere\u2019s only one  way to properly convey the insanity that is the Bugatti Chiron , and that\u2019s rattling off ludicrous facts. Let\u2019s start with just a few. The hypercar (for $3 million you get a term less pedestrian than \u201csupercar\u201d) is the among the fastest production cars on the planet. It can go from a standstill to 249 mph and get back to 0 mph in less than 42 seconds . It does 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. At full bore it covers 400 feet every second and will drain its 26-gallon fuel tank in eight minutes. .  Bugatti, based on the eastern reaches of France, is the arm of Volkswagen that does nothing but build vehicles so over the top that Marie Antoinette would dismiss them as gauche. To create the Chiron , the automaker\u2019s engineers followed two directives: subtract weight and add power. The former required building a body made of an ungodly amount of carbon fiber and titanium (and an aluminum grille designed to withstand bird strikes at 200+ mph). The latter focused on the gargantuan 8-liter, 16-cylinder engine, a hunk of metal that sits just behind the Bugatti\u2019s two leather-wrapped seats. .  In an age where even fellow hypercars like Mercedes-AMG\u2019s Project One  are going for downsized engines and electric propulsion, the Chiron's engine is an ode to the bygone days of excess. This wonder of engineering produces 1,500 horsepower and 1,200 pound-feet of torque  thanks to four turbochargers that work together to eradicate turbo lag (that pesky waiting period between hitting the gas pedal and getting the extra oomph ). That system lets the Chiron create max torque (which is what matters when you\u2019re talking acceleration) from just 2,000 rpm. None of this is necessary; every bit of it is amazing. . If you\u2019re taking these words in with your own eyes instead of having them read aloud to you by your live-in scribe/newsreader, you will never drive, let alone own, a Bugatti Chiron. But if you\u2019ve got $10,000, instead of plopping down a nice down payment on a normal person\u2019s car, consider spending it on your very own Chiron engine replica. The miniaturized power plant is the work of Amalgam, an English company that has produced exact replicas of Formula 1 cars, supercars, and engines since 1985, and cites Fabergé eggs as an inspiration. Measuring 18-by-nine inches and featuring more than 1,000 parts, the one-quarter-sized replica will look great on your desk. Once you\u2019ve cleared away those photos of your loved ones to make a bit of room, of course.

VTaylor Swift is seemingly shedding her good-girl image as fast as she possibly can. First, she released her music video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d where she killed off the \u201cold Taylor.\u201d Now, she has dropped the video for \u201c\u2026 Ready for It?\u201d the second single off of her upcoming Reputation album, and it\u2019s even more scandalous than we could have imagined. Swift gave us a first look at the video on Monday, dropping a preview on Instagram that shows her almost totally undressed as a naked cyborg. And in the full sci-fi music video, directed by longtime collaborator Joseph Kahn, the cyborg Taylor battles a different version of herself dressed in a hooded cloak and metallic lip. If we\u2019ve learned anything from \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d there\u2019s no limit to how many different Taylor Swifts this woman can play in one video and \u201c\u2026 Ready for It?\u201d seems to take that notion in stride. VIDEO: Taylor Swift Dropped New Single \u201cGorgeous" and, Naturally, the Internet Went Wild. Watch it at top and keep your calendars marked for her new album, Reputation, to drop Nov. 10. We\u2019re ready for it.

VJUVENTUS are reportedly set to rival Manchester United for the signature of Andre Gomes. Barcelona are willing to let the Portuguese midfielder leave after an unspectacular debut season at the Nou Camp. Juventus have entered the race to sign Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes. With United and Spurs circling for the 24-year-old ex-Valencia midfielder, Juve are now said to have now entered the race. The £45million signing played made just 17 Liga starts last season and has struggled to adapt in Catalonia. Sport say that agent Jorge Mendes has several clubs interested in signing his client. And Juve are believed to have moved to the front of the queue, with the possibility of an initial loan deal with an option to buy. Gomes has made just one Liga start for Barcelona this season. Jose Mourinho reportedly had an approach for the star rejected in the summer. MOST READ IN FOOTBALL. Back to the Blue-ture.   Chelsea are lining up Ancelotti to take over from under-fire Conte   .

VOctober 26, 2017 \u2013 \u201cTo Think Black Is Not Beautiful Enough Is Stupid\u201d \u2013 Says Tenny Coco, Lagos Socialite Who Stopped Bleaching After 6 Years. Tenny Coco, Lagos Based Makeup Artist Who Stopped Bleaching Says It Is Stupid To Think Black Is Not Beautiful Enough. Meet Teniola Aisha Kashaam, the founder of Tenny Coco Studio, a makeup studio located at 1139 bishop Oluwole street in Victoria Island Lagos. The popular socialite who goes by the name of Tenny Coco has stopped bleaching her skin because of the grave danger in it. According to her, she started her road to Melanin at the age of 19. Gradually it became an addiction. At a point when she saw people with ridiculously damaged skin due to harmful effect of bleaching chemicals, she had a change of mind. Here is what she wrote on the social media few hours ago:. See her before and after photos below\u2026. She is right! Black is truly beautiful. Hope others still bleaching their skin will learn one or two things from her story. To contact her for advice, please call 0908443055 or email Tennycoco92@gmail.com.

VThe Board of Directors of Nigerian Breweries Plc has announced a revenue of N254.7 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2017. In the statement of the result sent to Nigerian Stock Exchange, the Board of the Company further announced the declaration of an interim dividend of N7,996,902,051 per ordinary share of 50k in the share capital of the company. An analysis of the unaudited and provisional result shows that results from operating activities grew from N37.9 billion to N42.3 billion, Profit Before Tax rose from N27.8 billion to N34.4 billion, while Profit After Tax grew improved to close at N23.9 billion from the N20.1 billion posted in the same period in 2016. While commenting on the results, the Company Secretary/Legal Adviser, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Uaboi Agbebaku said \u201cdespite the continued challenging business environment, revenue in the first nine months of the year grew compared to the corresponding period in 2016\u201d. Agbebaku added that as a result of the Company\u2019s continued focus on internal efficiencies under its Cost Leadership programme, results from operating activities improved, which combined with lower Net Finance Charges resulted in increased profitability in the period. The company added that the interim dividend is payable subject to deduction of withholding tax at the appropriate rates on November 23, 2017 to all shareholders registered in the books of the Company at the close of business on November 15, 2017. In the statement signed by Agbebaku, the Board maintained that whilst the operating environment for the remainder of the year is expected to remain challenging, it is confident that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the Company is well placed to deliver a good return on investment to shareholders.

VApple revealed how much it will cost to fix the iPhone X without AppleCare+ on Friday and it\u2019s a lot more expensive than it used to be\u2014probably because of that fancy new OLED display. If you\u2019ve skipped the protection plan before, you may want to think twice this time around. Apple\u2019s New Repair Prices. Apple. Take a look at the chart above, which shows the cost of repairs without AppleCare+, and you\u2019ll notice the difference immediately. Just repairing the iPhone X screen ($279) is almost twice as expensive as it was on the iPhone 8 ($149) and 8 Plus ($169). Non-screen repairs aren\u2019t cheap either at $549, compared to $349 on the iPhone 8 and $399 on the 8 Plus. AppleCare+ is also more expensive than it used to be, at $199 for two years of coverage, up from $129 on the iPhone 8 and $149 on the 8 Plus. But once you pay for the extended warranty, the cost of repairs goes down to $29 for screen damage and $99 for everything else. (Without AppleCare+ you\u2019re only covered for one year and only for manufacturing defects). That\u2019s a lot of numbers, but what it all means is that if you break your iPhone X screen just once, you\u2019ll save money thanks to AppleCare+, spending $228 instead of $279. With previous models, it\u2019s actually been cheaper to go without the protection plan if you only end up cracking the screen once. So when you\u2019re buying the iPhone X (assuming you can even get your hands on one) take an extra minute to think about whether you should pay for AppleCare+. You\u2019ll thank yourself a few months from now if you drop it and the screen shatters.

VNot sure what wine to pair with your pasta this World Pasta Day? We asked Laurie Smorthwaite, founder of the KZN School of Wine, to share some of the best wine pairings to match the most popular pasta dishes. \u201cWhen it comes to pairing wine and pasta, it is all about the sauce\u201d, she said. Here are her guidelines for the pasta loving foodies. Tomato- based Pasta . Tomato-based sauces are best paired with medium bodied, high acid red wines or crisp, dry white wines. The high acid in tomatoes will soften the acid in any wine and can make it seem fat and flabby. Be careful with full bodied reds as these sauces can make them seem bitter and tannic. . Stick to tangy, high acid red wines with juicy fruit flavours and soft tannin such as Grenache, Merlot and Sangiovese. Crisp, dry white wines will also help to add a refreshing touch to the rich sauce. For white wines, look to pair with Sauvignon or Semillon blends. Creamy Pasta. The creaminess of béchamel and cheese based sauces is best complimented by white wines that have had some time in oak. The richness of the sauce will textually match a wooded Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc or Viognier. Floral red wines such a Pinot Noir are a great match for sauces with an added umami component such as Parmesan and mushrooms. Simple Pasta. Fresh home made pasta lightly tossed with quality olive oil and basil, the pure and authentic expression of pasta. Be it fresh pesto or pure olive oil, these dishes are best paired with delicate and refreshing white or rose wines. . Herbaceous wines such as sauvignon blanc will match the flavours in the dish as well as offer clean acidity to cut through the oil. . Dry Rieslings and un-oaked or lightly wooded Chenin Blanc will compliment your summer time pasta to keep you going back for more. . Spicy Pasta. For those looking for a little heat in their dish, stay clear of wines with high alcohol or tannin. Spicy dishes are best paired with fruity sweeter style wines. . Match Asian flavours with an aromatic Gewurztraminer, off dry Riesling or a light fruity rose for best effect .

VThe 2016 Google Pixel/Gizmodo. Android: The Pixel 2 comes loaded with special features beyond what you get with stock Android, and now Google is bringing some of those extras to older devices with Android 8.1. The latest update won\u2019t officially release until December, but you can download the first preview now without too much effort. How to Download the Android 8.1 Preview. Installing the latest version of Android is easy, but first you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a device that supports the update. For now, it\u2019s limited to Google\u2019s own gadgets. That includes the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, along with last year\u2019s Pixel and Pixel XL phones. It also covers the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and the Pixel C. When you\u2019re ready, head to the Android Beta Program website and you\u2019ll be asked to log into your Google account. Once you do that, you should see a page explaining the preview system with a section titled, \u201cYour eligible devices.\u201d Click on the device you want to update and the Android 8.1 preview should start to download automatically over the air. What\u2019s New in Android 8.1 Oreo?. Google. Google hasn\u2019t officially revealed what\u2019s included in Android 8.1, but Gadget Hacks already uncovered a handful of new features. Many of them come from the Pixel 2, while a couple are simple fixes for annoying things about Android 8.0. The best new feature might be the dark theme, which Google introduced with the Pixel 2. To switch it on, just change your home screen wallpaper to a dark image and your menus and folders will change to match it automatically. That\u2019s great if you don\u2019t feel like looking at a white screen all day, and especially at night right before going to sleep. Android 8.1 brings the semi-transparent notification shade from the Pixel 2 for a nice visual upgrade. You\u2019ll also get the new power menu introduced with Google\u2019s newest smartphone. It slides out from the side of the device where the physical power button is located and features a sleeker design than the old menu. GIF   . Gadget Hacks. As for the fixes, the latest Android update takes care of a couple of annoying notifications that were impossible to dismiss on Android 8.0: \u201cApps running in the background\u201d and \u201cApps drawing over other apps.\u201d You still can\u2019t just swipe them away, but Gadget Hacks has a separate guide for how to deal with these notifications in Android 8.1. That\u2019s everything you need to know for now, though it\u2019s possible Google could have more features buried in this Android 8.1 preview\u2014or more coming in the second beta next month.

VSeason two of Stranger Things finally dropped on Netflix just in time for Halloween. While you'll probably binge it all over the weekend, there will still be a light at the end of the Hawkins tunnel, because the show will definitely return for a third season! Showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer confirmed the good news to Vulture back in August and also revealed that the sci-fi series will possibly get a fourth and final season to end the series on, with Ross explaining, "We're thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out.". As far as where the series's story will go in the third and fourth seasons, Matt acknowledged that having the show's preteen heroes go through something traumatic every year isn't going to last forever. "I don't know if we can justify something bad happening to them once a year," he said, before Ross added, "They're going to have to get the f*ck out of this town! It's ridiculous!" In the meantime, we'll be on our couch catching up with Eleven and the gang.

VGiven that it's adapting Patrick Rothfuss' popular fantasy adventure book series and features the talents of Hamilton man Lin-Manuel Miranda as executive producer and TV/movie veteran John Rogers as showrunner, we're not exactly surprised to see The Kingkiller Chronicle quickly ending up with a home on the small screen. US cable channel Showtime has picked it up to develop it into a series. Though the plan had been to launch the adaptation as a movie with the show filling in narrative gaps and expanding the world, Variety's report makes no mention of the big screen version. Instead the series will develop under Rogers' watchful eye, with Miranda working on music for the show, which feels right, since the stories are so full of tunes. Rothfuss\u2019 series, which kicked off in 2007, includes an anchor trilogy (with the third book still to come) and three novellas set in the same world. The focus is told in three time streams: the present, in which the protagonist, Kvothe, is dictating his life\u2019s story to a historian of sorts; the past, a first-person account of Kvothe\u2019s life, and lastly, in chronologically cloudy parables and stories peppered throughout the books. If done correctly, this could represent Showtime's answer to the likes of Game Of Thrones. . "Showtime has always championed bold storytelling," said Miranda in a statement. "Pat Rothfuss' Kingkiller series is some of the most exciting storytelling I have ever read. I could not be more thrilled to help bring the sights and sounds of his wondrous world of Temerant to the screen." Naturally, we don't yet know when it might hit UK screens, but we're keeping our fingers crossed it A) makes it out of development hell and B) finds its way over here.

Vairpeace plane.  Air Peace has confirmed the arrest of some of its former employees by security personnel of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) over the burglary incident at its Akure Airport office on Sunday night. A statement issued by the Corporate Communications Manager of Air Peace, Mr. Chris Iwarah said the suspects worked for the airline for less than a month. The airline commended the vigilant FAAN security for resolving the riddle surrounding the burglary of its office within days. It would be recalled that the Akure office of the airline was burgled between Sunday night and Monday morning, with a safe containing millions of naira of sales proceeds carted away. Some former staff of the airline were, however, arrested over the burglary on Thursday when one of them attempted to convey the stolen cash from where it was hidden in the bush. \u201cWe can confirm that some former members of our staff were on Thursday arrested as the suspects behind the burglary incident at our Akure office. \u201cBackground checks were conducted on the suspects before they were employed in compliance with our strict employment procedure and no report of being involved in any previous crime was found against them. It is quite regrettable that some able-bodied members of the public would prefer crime to gainful employment. \u201cWe commend the vigilant FAAN security personnel for arresting the suspects and handing them over to the police for further investigation. We trust the police would ensure they are made to face the wrath of the law to serve as a deterrent to others with criminal tendencies,\u201d Air Peace said.

It's been given a paintjob makeover for its latest outing, though. There's also a new Ford Escort Cosworth that Block has been working plus a mystery vehicle. Ford Escort Cosworth is new for Gymkhana 10. The video hints that it's a F-Series pickup truck from the 70s fitted with a huge V8 and twin-turbos. The building of these wild cars will all be detailed in The Gymkhana Files - an original Amazon series announced for late 2018. The show will document the filming plus parts of Block's life. Revealing the news to his fans on Facebook, Block said: "Epic trailer alert! This will be the biggest Gymkhana project ever.". Tyre-smoking action is guaranteed.

VIf you're looking to pre-order an iPhone X, be aware that in the U.S., you'll need to wait until December to actually get the phone. . Right now, the shipping date for all variants of the device \u2014 64GB or 256GB, Silver or Space Gray \u2014 is five to six weeks. . Given the numerous rumors that Apple doesn't have nearly enough iPhone X units to satisfy demand, this actually isn't that bad, though with the U.S. just waking up, those shipping times might get extended further. . The pre-orders for the iPhone X on Apple's website opened at around 3 a.m. ET on Friday, and initially the shipping times were 2-3 weeks, but this quickly changed into 4-5 weeks, and then to 5-6 weeks. . In Apple's UK online store, the shipping time was 5-6 weeks for all variants of the phone right after pre-orders went live, and it hasn't changed since. . If you don't want to wait until December, you can still try and get an iPhone X in one of Apple's retail store on Nov. 3. That, however, will likely include waiting in a long, long line. .

New York-based artist and CollegeHumor head illustrator Jacob Andrews has plucked some of the most spine-tingling two-sentence horror stories from the depths of Reddit, and turned them into a short series of chilling comics. Unwelcome intruders, texts from the afterlife, and dug-up bones are just a few of the themes that haunt each panel, and it\u2019s amazing how they manage to unsettle the reader in so few frames. Scroll down to get spooked, just make sure you have every light in the house on first. You\u2019ll thank us later. If you\u2019re still not scared senseless, check out more bit-sized horror stories here. 1. 2. 3. Written by: splettnet. 4. Written by: t0rvahl.  10 hours ago by\u200b Greta J.  .    Greta J.  .

VEducation Minister, Adamu Adamu. The Chairmen of the governing councils of four colleges of education which the Goodluck Jonathan administration upgraded to universities have asked the Federal Government to effect the change. The institutions are Adeyemi College of Education in Ondo State, Federal College of Education, Zaria, Kaduna State, Federal College of Education, Kano, and Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. The past administration had pronounced the colleges universities of education in its last days in order to train teachers for Nigerian schools. However, the Muhammadu Buhari administration reversed the decision on assumption of office because of the lack of resources. In a statement in Osogbo on Friday, Mr John Fasogbon on behalf of the council chairmen, appealed to the Federal Government to upgrade the institutions to universities. Fasogbon, who is the Chairman of the Governing Council of Alvan Ikoku College of Education, said granting the institutions university status would enable them to produce teachers for schools. He said the step would help in realising the Federal Government\u2019s effort to develop the education sector. \u201cWe want to appeal to the Honourable Minister to use his good offices to urgently re-pronounce the affected universities in order to make them functional for the benefit of Nigerians,\u2019\u2019 he said. Fasogbon also appealed to the government to allow the tenure of the governing councils to lapse before appointing new ones.

VHave you ever made homemade ice cream?. I can still recall the first time I attempted the task. Back then, I was a smiling fourth grader \u2014 eagerly shaking a Ziploc full of half and half, salt, and ice cubes in science class. If we rattled the baggie hard and long enough, my teacher told us, a chemical reaction would result in the creation of ice cream!. I remember the disappointment I felt when I swallowed a spoonful of the foamy substance at the end of class. My questionable concoction tasted nothing like the ice cream flavors I had come to know and love. Making tasty ice cream on your own, I realized, wasn\u2019t as easy as I had originally thought. These days, you can purchase ice cream makers to do the drill for you. The good news, though, is that you don\u2019t really need one of these machines to be able to make delicious homemade ice cream. Forget the Ziploc baggies, too; all you need is some heavy cream, condensed milk, and vanilla extract \u2014 as well as a freezer to stick them in!. Check out the ingredients list and directions below to learn how to whip up a batch of scrumptious mermaid ice cream, with color-coated cones to match. Then, watch the video for more in-depth instructions. After you see how easy it is to make ice cream at home, you won\u2019t want to head to the store every time you feel a craving coming on. Do you know any kids who would love this mermaid-inspired sweet treat?. Prep time is 5 hours. Cook time is 0 hours. Serves 10 people. Ingredients. heavy cream. sweetened condensed milk. vanilla extract. food coloring (four different hues). pearl-like sprinkles. small, white sprinkles. Instructions. Pour the heavy cream into a large bowl, then beat until fluffy using an electric mixer or whisk. Add the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract over the beaten cream. Fold in the ingredients with a rubber spatula. Divide the mixture into four bowls, then mix different shades of food coloring into each. Layer three bowls of the colored batter into a loaf pan. Run a knife through the batter in the pan, then smooth the top over. Top the batter with pearl-like sprinkles, then freeze until firm. Dip ice cream cones into the remaining bowl of batter and twist so it sticks around the outer rim. Then, add small, white sprinkles on top. Scoop the frozen batter and serve in the coated cones like ice cream. .  Please SHARE this mermaid-inspired dessert with your pals on Facebook! . More Stories from LittleThings.

VToday is a good day for those looking for new bluetooth audio tech in their lives. First, these headphones, with their noise isolating technology and distortion free audio, are 84 percent off. That\u2019s savings of $270! Then, there\u2019s this portable speaker, which is discounted nearly as much at 80 percent off. Normally $320, these bluetooth headphones are 84 percent off today (Photo via Amazon). Normally $100, this speaker is 80 percent off today (Photo via Amazon). Here\u2019s what CNET had to say about the headphones:. \u201cThese noise-isolating over-the-ear phones look and sound like they cost a lot more the Super 66s look and feel substantial, with a brushed-metal band that folds for easier storage and heavily cushioned ear cups\u2026definitely among the more comfortable I\u2019ve ever worn\u2026 the headphones sound superb\u201d \u2013 CNET: Rick Broida. That\u2019s high praise. Considering solid bluetooth headphones often cost in the $300+ price range these headphones normally go for, the $50 sale price is a huge bargain. Photo via Amazon.

VResults of Kenya's presidential election re-run have started to trickle in, with early estimates of the turnout at below 35 per cent, dealing a blow to President Uhuru Kenyatta's hopes for a decisive second-term mandate. With nearly all followers of opposition leader Raila Odinga heeding the veteran's call for a boycott, Kenyatta's victory is not in question. Less clear is his ability to unite the east African nation, whose deep ethnic divisions have been exposed during the bloody and controversial election process and multiple court cases in the past three months. The first election, in August, was annulled by the courts because of procedural irregularities, denying Kenyatta a simple victory over his long-term political rival. Voting on Thursday was marred by skirmishes between police and stone-throwing opposition supporters, who prevented polling stations from opening in four pro- Odinga counties, forcing election officials to postpone the exercise by 48 hours. The election commission said more than one in 10 polling stations failed to open. Its chairman, Wafula Chebukati, Tweeted overnight that 6.55 million ballots had been cast - just 34.5 per cent of registered voters. By contrast, turnout in the August election was 80 per cent. In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said. In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another. There were similar scenes in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. At least one person was shot in the leg, a Red Cross official said, and a church was fire-bombed. Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original August 8 vote, raising fears of sustained violence only a decade after 1,200 people were killed in serious ethnic fighting triggered by another disputed vote. Legal challenges to the re-run are expected. Reuters.

VAlexander Stubb said there are no winners \u2013 apart from a few lawyers (Picture: PA). Brexit is one of the biggest travesties of the modern era which will result in no winners, the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) has said. Former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb denied that the EIB wanted to punish the UK for the decision to quit the bloc, but acknowledged it could take until 2054 for the UK to get back its £3 billion invested in the bank. He also said that there had been less demand for EIB investment from the UK in recent years and the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit was making lending decisions more complicated. Mr Stubb said: \u2018I have a British heart pumping, I am married to a Brit, my children have dual nationality and I think Brexit is one of the biggest travesties that we have seen in the modern era. \u2018So I will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain, but the economic facts are just such that there are no winners in Brexit \u2013 apart from perhaps a few lawyers. \u2018Unfortunately, we will see this in the coming years.\u2019. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u2018No one in the EIB is out to punish the UK, actually we are out to alleviate the pain.\u2019. He said the UK\u2019s \u2018paid-in capital\u2019 to the EIB amounted to around £3 billion (3.5 billion euro), along with around £30 billion (35 billion euro) of uncalled capital. \u2018Everyone on both sides of the negotiating table agree that we have to pay back the 3.5 billion euro, basically in cash, and that will happen over a long period, up until 2054, because that\u2019s when the loans are amortised,\u2019 he said. The UK has a 16% stake in the Luxembourg-based bank lends money to support projects from major infrastructure developments to small firms in order to support EU policy goals, but that will end with Brexit. Asked about concerns that lending to the UK was being hit with delays despite still being in the EU, Mr Stubb said financial investments in the UK in 2016 amounted to around £7 billion (eight billion euro). That figure would be lower in 2017 and 2018 in part because of the \u2018uncertainty of Brexit\u2019 and the guarantees required by the EIB as a result of the decision to quit the EU. \u2018The investment curve in the UK right now shows downwards because of the insecurities and uncertainties of Brexit, and that\u2019s just a fact,\u2019 he said. People were \u2018a little bit afraid\u2019 of the economic consequences \u2018and that\u2019s why we are not getting the requests\u2019 for loans.

V(Source: Bloodhound). \u201cRecords are meant to be broken.\u201d Andy Green must really believe in that statement as he straps down in the supersonic car called Bloodhound to break his own record. The vehicle is being developed by a team from Oxford in the UK. They have been working on it for years in the hopes to break the world land speed record. (Source: Bloodhound). The existing land speed record stands at 763 mph, also set by Andy Green back in 1997 with the Thrust Supersonic Vehicle. The team from Oxford aims to reach 1000 mph with the new vehicle and for this purpose tested the Rolls Royce EJ200 jet engine of the car at the end of September. The engine was taken from the powerful Eurofighter Typhoon plane. With the engine test done, the team is ready for a test run of the vehicle in Newquay, UK at the end of October, when the car will travel up to 200 mph. \u201cWhat a fantastic ending to the end of our first week of testing,\u201d said Stuart Edmondson, Head of Engineering Operations. \u201cIntegrating a Eurofighter Typhoon jet engine into the car is a huge challenge; however, we have succeeded! Witnessing the EJ200 jet engine at maximum reheat is a fantastic experience. Not only can you see the shock diamonds and hear the deafening noise, you can physically feel the power of the engine as your body shakes. With the static tests complete the Team will move onto dynamic testing, ready for our high speed, 200mph, trials at the end of October.\u201d. (Source: Bloodhound). The final attempt will take place at the Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape region of South Africa. The team is eager to complete all the prior tests and attempt to break the record in 2018. Latest news is that it will be pushed up to the start of 2019. During the finale, Bloodhound will take around 55 seconds to reach the maximum speed of 1,000 mph. Afterwards, it will take another 65 seconds to slow down with the help of disk brakes and a parachute.

VMovies, TV, Comic Books and Video Games. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective to return, Young Guns and Major League reboots also in development. Ace Ventura is definitely a character of his time, one who launched the 90\u2019s success story that was Jim Carrey, while grossing over $100m worldwide and creating catchphrases that have echoed through to today. Now, off the back of the news that Morgan Creek Productions, the company behind the film and its sequel, When Nature Calls, are rebranding, comes the announcement from Deadline that they plan to revive the pet detective. It\u2019s highly unlikely that Carrey will return, having recently revealed that his old self doesn\u2019t exist anymore, and with Man on the Moon documentary Jim and Andy: The Great Beyond set to underline his underrated strengths as an actor, he\u2019ll probably concentrate on more serious projects, such as Michel Gondry directed Showtime half-hour, Kidding. Morgan Creek Entertainment Group will move forward with the Ace Ventura franchise regardless, saying \u201cwe wanted to do a mainstream theatrical production relaunch,\u201d stressing that the idea is not to do a straight remake but a new movie in the spirit of the original, part of Morgan Creek\u2019s strategy to honor its library properties with the new takes without undercutting them. \u201cBecause it\u2019s episodic in nature, about a pet detective, it also lends itself to a traditional single-camera series franchise.\u201d. In addition to Ace Ventura, Morgan Creek is also looking to exploit several other titles in its library, with development underway on feature film and TV reboots of the likes of Young Guns, Major League, Nightbreed, Diabolique, and Pacific Heights. So what do you think? Will the Ace Ventura revival be another Dumb and Dumber Too or a case of \u201cAlrighty then\u201d?.

V Access Bank Plc has announced a profit after tax of N56.4 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2017, correspondent reports.  The profit after tax increased by 4.25 per cent when compared to N54.1 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2016.  This is contained in the bank\u2019s nine months financial results released by the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in Lagos on Thursday.  Its gross earnings rose to N245.87 billion as against N181.2 billion achieved in the preceding period of 2016.  The results also indicated 33 per cent growth in gross earnings year-on-year to N365 billion from N275 billion in 2016, driven primarily by the strong performance on core revenue lines.  Commenting on the bank\u2019s performance, Mr Herbert Wigwe, the bank\u2019s Group Managing Director said that strategies embarked upon between 2013 and 2017 contributed to the growth.  He said that the reporting period marked the last quarter of the 2013 \u20132017 strategic period, adding that the bank remained committed to improving the quality of its balance sheet.  He said that the bank\u2019s third quarter performance showed that operating costs reduced significantly by 18 per cent quarter-on-quarter to 49.5 billion in Sept.  Wigwe said that the development reaffirmed the bank\u2019s commitment to rein in costs and improve operating efficiency.  According to him, capital and liquidity buffers of 20.5 per cent and 46.0 per cent respectively are well above the minimum regulatory requirement.  Access Bank is a full service commercial bank operating through a network of 371 branches and service outlets located in major centres across Nigeria, Sub Saharan Africa, and the United Kingdom with representative offices in China and the UAE.  The bank has more than 830,000 shareholders, including several Nigerians and international institutional investors and has enjoyed what is arguably Africa\u2019s most successful banking growth trajectory in the last twelve years.

VJosh Gurto has been hiding in the woods for the last several weeks. . An Ohio man was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of a 1-year-old girl earlier this month, said police. . Thirty-seven-year-old Josh Gurto has been wanted by police for raping and killing 1-year-old Serreniti Sutley, the daughter of his girlfriend, at an apartment complex in Conneaut, reported WKYC. Police believe Gurto was hiding in the woods for the last few weeks before he was found and arrested in Pennsylvania on Oct. 27. . When police arrested Gurto, they also found a knife, several maps, and a tent. The supplies found were most likely used by Gurto during his weeks in hiding. Police believe he would have traveled toward Pittsburgh had he not been found. . According to police, Sutley was first found unresponsive and suffering from cardiac arrest in her bedroom by her 22-year-old mother. Sutley\u2019s mother has not yet been identified. A preliminary autopsy revealed that Sutley died from blunt force trauma to the head. Gurto was not arrested on the day Sutley died because police could not gather enough evidence during questioning to detain him.

VThe Federal Executive Council yesterday approved a tax relief scheme to attract private sector involvement in the provision of federal road infrastructure across the country. The approval was the outcome of a memorandum for the setting up of a Road Trust Fund (RTF) presented by the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, to the council at its meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. The RTF concept was jointly developed by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing. The fund is expected to mobilise significant capital into road provision in order to unlock socio-economic development as well as facilitate investment across all areas of Nigeria to achieve inclusive economic growth. Federal roads carry more than 80% of national vehicular and freight traffic, accounting for 17 per cent of the total national road network. Addressing State House correspondents at the end of the FEC meeting, the finance minister explained that the RTF would facilitate and incentivise private sector involvement in Nigeria's federal roads infrastructure. Adeosun said, "It is a form of public private partnership that will accelerate the provision of federal roads by allowing private sector operators to collectively fund road provision in exchange for tax credits. This will complement federal government's budgetary allocation to roads. "Private sector participation is being incentivised through a tax credit scheme that enables all participating companies to claim tax relief based on the amount of capital contribution (on a pro-rata basis)," she stated. Already, two prominent companies - Dangote Group and the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) - have keyed into the scheme. The minister revealed that "while Dangote management indicated readiness to construct 35km Apapa-Oworonshoki road in Lagos and get a three-year tax holiday, the NLNG signed a N120bn agreement for the construction of the Bonny Road in Bayelsa State where it will provide half of the amount under same agreement.". "We have already consulted with the private sector in the development of the RTF and some companies have already identified roads they wish to reconstruct and are organising their funding. "However, this scheme is designed such that financial intermediaries will be promoting Road Trust Fund projects and soliciting commitments from interested companies," Adeosun explained. Under the tax relief scheme, companies will be allowed to recover 100 per cent of costs incurred on road infrastructure as a tax credit against total tax payable (including up to 10 per cent for cost of funds). The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola and Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, were also at the post-FEC briefing of the State Press Corps.

VThe presidential ballot boxes which has been dispatched to various polling stations in Mombasa/ELKANA JACOB. The Court of Appeal on Wednesday suspended a ruling by the High Court in order to forestall a crisis, the judges said. High Court Judge George Odunga had earlier ruled that the appointment of returning officers and their deputies was illegal. Odunga however failed to quash their gazettement. A three-judge bench of justices Erastus Githinji, Martha Koome and Fatuma Sichale suspended the ruling until an appeal filed by IEBC is heard and determined. \u201cIn defence of the sovereignty of the people and the supremacy of the Constitution, we order that the declaration by the High Court that the appointment of returning and deputy returning officers was in violation of regulation 3 ( 2 ) aforesaid as read with article 38 and 81 of the Constitution and the implementation thereof is hereby suspended and or put in abeyance pending the hearing of the application inter partes,\u201d the bench ruled. That order meant the functions of the returning officers and their deputies as regards yesterday\u2019s repeat election were valid. Odunga had said that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission violated sections of the Constitution in appointing the returning officers and their deputies. IEBC immediately filed an appeal. The commission said Odunga erred in law and urged the appellate court to overturn his decision. After listening to the submissions made by the IEBC, the judges said they were mandated by law to do justice without undue regard to technicalities of procedure. It is at that point where they explained that they took the decision to suspend the ruling in order to avert a constitutional crisis. The judges said they had powers to give orders in the presence of one party in prevailing circumstances in order to forestall a constitutional crisis. . IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati later announced that the election would proceed as planned because the High Court ruling did not affect it. Chebukati said the ruling did not invalidate the appointment of the officers or their deputies because it did not quash their gazettement. \u201cThe judgment does not affect the repeat presidential polls. It should be noted that the commision has deployed the same officials gazetted for the August 8 polls,\u201d Chebukati said.

VEromosele Abiodun. The Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Dr. Dakuku Peterside has charged Nigerians to key into the opportunities afforded by the Blue economy stating that it is the fastest growing sector in the world with enormous business potential. Peterside stated this while speaking at the 23rd Nigerian Economic Summit (NES) themed: \u2018Opportunities, Productivity and Employment: Actualising the Economy Recovery and Growth Plan.\u2019. He stated that with the length of the nation\u2019s coastline and the attendant volume of maritime trade, Nigeria is at an advantage of developing the blue economy and stakeholders have to actively participate to reap the benefits of the sector. According to Peterside, \u201cDeveloping the blue economy is paramount across the globe now, and the public and private sector have to collaborate to sustainably harness the potentials of our maritime sector for the benefit of the Nigerian economy especially as the federal government continues the economic diversification drive.\u201d. The NIMASA boss also stated that it was high time Nigerians began to tap into the opportunities embedded in our maritime sector adding that economies of the likes of Singapore, Ukraine and South Korea thrive on the activities of their maritime sector. He further suggested that with improved maintenance culture, adequate data management and statistics as well as articulated actions from stakeholders backed up with political will, Nigeria will be a leading light in the comity of maritime nations. Peterside further advocated synergy within stakeholders stating that the agency with the support of the federal government is working assiduously to ensure that Nigerians reap the benefits that abound the sector. He pointed out that the newly approved maritime security architecture will effectively reduce piracy and other related sea crimes.  Peterside charged stakeholders to actively participate in the Nigerian maritime sector in order to support the growth of the country\u2019s blue economy.

VFew things are sadder than tossing out a stale half-loaf of beautiful artisanal (or homemade) bread. The problem: said beautiful bread lacks the stabilizers present in commercial presliced loaves, and so it goes from rocking your world to rock-hard ridiculously fast. The solution: . eat more bread.  a simple trick involving your freezer. . Here's what you should do: . Within 24 hours (maximum) of cutting into a loaf, slice up the remaining bread. (Don't wait until it's already turned the corner; at that point, your best bet is giving leftovers a second life as croutons, breadcrumbs, or bread pudding.) Don't just stick the bread in the freezer unsliced. Unless your kitchen is equipped with a buzz saw, there's no chance you're going to be able to slice it without thawing the entire loaf first (trust us, we've tried). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper, arrange the slices in one layer on top of that, and put it in the freezer, uncovered, until frozen solid. (The parchment will prevent the gorgeous, moist crumb of the bread from sticking to the pan, and the single layer will prevent the slices from freezing stuck to each other.). Once the bread slices are frozen, transfer them to a resealable freezer bag, removing as much air from the bag as possible. When a bread craving hits, take out just as many slices of bread as you'll eat then, and either let them thaw at room temperature, or put them directly in the toaster (they'll take about one extra minute to toast). The texture of the bread will be about 95 percent as good as fresh bread and far better than second-day, already-starting-to-go-stale bread. Stored frozen (in a resealable freezer bag), sliced bread will stay fresh and delicious for at least six months, if not longer.

V A second protester was killed in Kenya on Friday as anger raged a day after a divisive election boycotted by the opposition, taking the death toll from two days of protests to eight. . Raids have become common in parts of Kenya in recent months by pastoralists invading private land, raiding homes and driving livestock into farms. The latest victim was shot dead by police in the Kawangware slum in Nairobi during clashes involving members of three tribal groups, police and witnesses said. \u201cWe have one fatality \u2014 a person shot during the skirmishes. The situation is still tense because the area is dark after the power went off,\u201d a police officer at the scene told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. . Nairobi Police Chief Japheth Koome confirmed the death but gave no further details. Josphat Ochwaya, a local resident who was there at the time, told AFP it started when a group of youths \u201cstarted attacking people and questioning why people never voted\u201d in Thursday\u2019s presidential re-run which was widely boycotted by supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga. \u201cThat\u2019s when an all-out war broke out and youths armed themselves to protect businesses.. because there was looting by some who took advantage,\u201d he said, noting that a supermarket was broken into then set on fire. . When the police turned up, the youths fled but continued to hurl stone at each other and at the police, who opened fire, killing one, he told AFP saying there were \u201cgunshots all over\u201d. During the morning, another protester was shot dead in the western town of Bungoma during a protest against plans to repeat Thursday\u2019s ballot in four opposition strongholds this weekend after violence blocked voting on election day. Such plans were later postponed. . A witness said the man had been shot as people \u201cwere running away from the police\u201d but the local police chief said the man had been shot after trying to grab an officer\u2019s gun. . Another six people died in Thursday\u2019s violence, most of them in Odinga\u2019s western strongholds. . Since independence in 1963, three of Kenya\u2019s four presidents have come from the Kikuyu ethnic group, to which President Uhuru Kenyatta belongs. The other was Kalenjin. That has left the Luos, Odinga prominent among them, and other major ethnic groups feeling excluded from power and marginalised for over half a century.

VLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp still has a problem at left-back. Alberto Moreno is better than last season, but that\u2019s not saying much. He signed Andrew Robertson, but clearly isn\u2019t convinced. James Milner is a midfielder again. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Liverpool are being linked with a move for yet another left-back in January. Italian media say that Roma\u2019s Emerson Palmieri is one of their top targets. The story comes from Gazzamercato, which sounds like a shop dedicated solely to Paul Gascoigne merchandise. To be clear, would spend all my pocket money there. They say Klopp wanted to sign Palmieri in the summer, but he did his ACL in May which ruled him out for six months. If Palmieri returns in November and proves his fitness, Klopp will return with a £22m bid in January. He joined Roma for less than £2m in 2015. Reports in Italy claim Liverpool will bid \u20ac25M for Emerson Palmieri in January. Don't understand why we'd do that, but anyway. \u2014 Mik (@MikLFC) October 26, 2017.

VI can't even SEE the chart. While plenty of consumers may be frustrated with how the iPhone X pre-sale went down, at least one group of people couldn't be happier. You guessed it, that would be the folks at Apple. . According to the company, the pre-sale went pretty, pretty good \u2014 calling the demand "off the charts.". "We are thrilled to be taking orders for iPhone X, the future of the smartphone," a company spokesperson told Mashable. "We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts. We\u2019re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. We will keep accepting orders online, and iPhone X will be available at Apple retail stores on Friday, November 3starting at 8 a.m., as well as from our carrier and retailer partners around the world.\u201d. The iPhone X pre sale started today..... I also got paid today.... this isn\u2019t good. \u2014 J Daddy (@JustinRobinson0) October 27, 2017. That's right, people really want that iPhone X. At least according to Apple, anyway. . It seems the many die-hard Apple fans were fine ignoring the small word of caution from Steve Wozniak about waiting just a bit to buy, and dived right in. Good for you, Apple. Good for you. .

V Copa del Rey.  Result: Fuenlabrada 0-2 Real Madrid.  Venue: Estadio Fernando Torres.  Real Madrid saw off a spirited Fuenlabrada at the Estadio Fernando Torres on Thursday evening, winning the first leg of their Copa del Rey Round of 32 tie 2-0.  Zinedine Zidane left out a number of first team regulars for the encounter, having only included the likes of Marco Asensio, Nacho and Lucas Vazquez in the starting line-up.  The hosts started brightly, although Real dominated possession as expected. There was little in the way of first half chances.  However, in the 44th minute, Marcos Llorente fired a powerful strike at goal from the edge of the box \u2014 forcing Jordi Codina to tip it onto the crossbar.  Fuenlabrada survived the Los Blancos onslaught at the end of the half and the sides went into the break at 0-0.  Los Blancos did not start the second half off with the same intensity that they showed at the end of the first. Nevertheless, they continued to control play.  In the 62nd minute, the visitors were awarded a soft penalty as Fran García pulled back Achraf Hakimi. It was a tight decision, as it was unclear whether or not the foul was inside the box.  Either way, Marco Asensio stepped up, sent Codina the wrong way, and opened the scoring.  Real nearly doubled their lead 67 minutes in, but Codina made a fine save to tip Borja Mayoral\u2019s strike away from goal.  Three minutes later, the former Real goalkeeper made an alert diving save to deny Mayoral again \u2014 this time from a header.  Lucas Vázquez fired narrowly wide from just outside the box in the 77th minute as Real continued their late surge.  Just over a minute later, they were rewarded for their dominance as Paco Candela was adjudged to have fouled Theo Hernández inside the penalty area as a corner came in.  Candela was handed his second yellow and Vázquez slotted the ball into the bottom corner to double Real\u2019s lead.  Los Blancos surrendered their one-man advantage in the 89th minute as Jesús Vallejo was shown a straight red for a foul on Luis Milla. However, despite their brave effort, Fuenlabrada did not have enough time to instigate a comeback.  Fuenlabrada can hold their heads up high going into the second leg after having taken the game to Real, but they were steamrolled by the European champions late on and eventually succumbed.

VIn a bid to support the growth of the Nigeria\u2019s capital market, the National Assembly has said that it is concluding plans to review some of the enabling laws that might have caused inhibitions to the growth of the stock market and hindered it from playing its pivotal role in capital formation. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Capital Market, Mr. Bukar Mustapha, gave this hint yesterdat during his visit to the Exchange for an interactive session with stakeholders and also sound the closing gong. For the equities market to take its pride of place in the domestic economy, he said laws guiding market operations needed to be amended to make the market a better place than what it used to be. \u201cParticularly, the issue of market Demutualisation will be looked into, the Investment Securities Act (ISA), the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) amongst others needed to be amended to up the game in the market. \u201cWe need to build the market. Presently it\u2019s not playing the role it ought to play in financial services. We have infrastructural deficit, which can be addressed if the capital market is well positioned to take its pride of place. On issues preventing foreign investment from coming to the local market, Mustapha noted that the capital market can work with other global agencies to address it frontally. He explained that the place of Private Public Partnership (PPP), like is done in other clime to develop infrastructure must be galvanised, by having a National Road Authority in place to champion the cause of deficit in road construction. He said Inter-Model means of transportation to fix deficit in transportation is the way to go, \u201cWe need to have an entry point based on international standard,\u201d he added.

V Amazon reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Thursday and predicted even stronger results for the holiday season. .   Drew Angerer / Getty Images  . Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, arrives for the third day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in July. Amazon's stock price soared to more than $1,000 per share in after-market trading on Thursday after the company reported higher-than-expected revenues and offered an optimistic projection for its next quarter, which includes the critical holiday season. Amazon's total sales were $43.7 billion, up 34% from the third quarter of last year, when the company sold $32.7 billion worth of everything from toilet paper to streaming movies. Analysts had predicted just over $42 billion in revenue. The company attributed $1.3 billion of the revenue figure to Whole Foods, which Amazon bought on August 28. Amazon slashed prices on a number of popular items at Whole Foods after it completed the merger. In Whole Foods' fourth quarter of 2016, which ended on September 25, it had $3.5 billion of sales. By comparison, Amazon's most recent quarter ended on September 30, indicating that Whole Foods' revenues have not changed drastically under Amazon's control. As usual, the company's profits were relatively small \u2014 $256 million, or 52 cents per share, almost flat with the third quarter of last year as it ploughed money back into the business. In the last three months, for example, Amazon bought $2.7 billion worth of property, equipment, and software, along with the over $13 billion it spent to acquire on Whole Foods. The company's shares closed Thursday at $972, but surged almost 8% to $1,047 per share in after-market trading. Going into today's earnings report, Amazon shares had risen almost 30% this year. While Amazon is still worth less than giants like Apple and Alphabet, analysts have long expected it to top the psychologically meaningful number of $1,000 per share. The company had first hit the milestone in May before dipping back under. After Amazon reported a massive increase in its "Prime Day" sales, the stock went over $1,000 in July. The company said it expected between $56 and $60.5 billion of sales in the fourth quarter, which is always the company's biggest. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Amazon had $43.7 billion worth of sales, meaning that it expects an increase of 28% to 38%.

VHonda showed off a slick new Sports EV concept at the Tokyo Motor Show earlier this week, but the automaker's most charming future-forward design to debut at the event isn't something you'll ever take for a drive. . The Japanese company unveiled the RoboCas concept, an all-electric, self-driving cargo robot that looks like the offspring of the bot couple from Disney's WALL-E. Just take a look at the family resemblance:. I mean, just look at this thing. There's not a ton of information about the RoboCas concept in terms of specs, so we don't know how long its battery might last or what type of system enables the self-driving functionality beyond a reference to "Honda's autonomous mobility technology." Honda instead described the bot as a companion that was "born to make each person\u2019s ideas and dreams come true.". The RoboCas concept is similar to other autonomous machines from companies like Vespa-maker Piaggio, which makes a companion cargo bot on wheels called the Gita. Postmates and DoorDash started using wheeled machines from Starship Technologies in pilot programs for self-driving deliveries back in January, sending the robots out on the streets of Washington, D.C. and Redwood City, California, respectively. This might be too cute. Honda's concept looks to be more sophisticated than the delivery bots, but the automaker didn't announce any plans for wide-scale production. You'll have to wait to play out your wildest WALL-E fantasies until the design is green-lit beyond concept status. .

VApple Inc. (AAPL) is furthering its vision of a world where devices are charged wirelessly, inking a deal to acquire PowerbyProxi, a New Zealand-based wireless charging technology company for an undisclosed sum. According to a report from New Zealand's Stuff, which broke the news of the deal, PowerbyProxi has roughly 55 employees and holds more than 300 patents that have to do with wireless charging. While sources wouldn\u2019t say how much Apple is paying for the company, it reported it's at least in the high tens of millions of dollars range. "We want to bring truly effortless charging to more places and more customers around the world," Dan Riccio, Apple senior vice president of hardware engineering, said in the report. Apple rarely confirms smaller acquisitions. (See more: Goldman Names New iPhone's Biggest Beneficiaries.). Ever since the iPhone maker launched the iPhone 8, iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3 in September, it has been touting its vision of charging mobile gadgets without having to plug them in. All three devices have a wireless charging capability and come without a headphone jack. The Cupertino, California technology powerhouse also announced it will launch a wireless charging mat that works with all the devices dubbed AirPower and roll out third-party wireless charges that also work with Qi, the wireless charging standard the new smartphones are based on. Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium earlier in the year, the industry body that created the Qi standard. While the company made a big splash with built-in wireless charging for it latest devices, it has been slow to adopt the technology. Samsung Electronics (SSNLF), as well as other smartphone makers, have been offering the capability for some time now. According to CNBC, Samsung Ventures, the investment unit of the South Korean consumer electronics giant, invested $4 million in PowerbyProxi in 2013. (See more: Apple Unveils iPhone X, 8, New Watch, Apple TV 4K.). It's not clear why Apple was drawn to PowerbyProxi, but Jake Saunder, a research analyst at ABI Research, told CNBC it could be interested in the company\u2019s products that make wireless charging of multiple devices possible. With the technology, Apple could develop pads that charge more than one device at a time, which should be attractive to consumers. The analyst speculated that it could even enable Apple to develop huge charging pads that can power up laptops and electric scooters wirelessly. Fady Mishriki, the founder of PowerbyProxi, which is a spin-out from Auckland University, said that there are \u201ctremendous\u201d synergies between the two. \u201cWe are excited to continue our growth in Auckland and contribute to the great innovation in wireless charging coming out of New Zealand," he said in the report.

VPatients were temporarily discharged from hospitals on Thursday and leaders mobilised transport for locals as Jubilee pulled all stops to ensure voters in its strongholds cast their ballots. Traders closed their businesses and released workers to go and vote in the presidential rerun. In Nyeri, the county hired 10 matatus to ferry patients from hospitals to various polling stations. PATIENTS. In combined efforts with county ambulances, eligible voters in hospital wards were being taken to their respective polling stations in the six sub-counties. New mothers whose polling stations were within the hospital vicinity left their children in the care of nurses to go and vote. More than 100 patients accompanied by nurses were taken out to cast their ballots. The leaders reasoned that a high voter turn out would give President Uhuru Kenyatta a strong position in his re-election campaign. TRANSPORT. Ms Elizabeth Wangechi, 63, said she had to vote to elect a leader of her choice who will ensure the country progresses. The arrangement to get patients to polling stations was organised by Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru. Two matatus were deployed to private hospitals including Consolata Mathari Mission Hospital. Despite being confined to a wheelchair, Mr John Kahumbi, 52, said he had to vote as a show of his patriotism. "I voted last time. And I must vote for the President today to ensure the country moves forward," he said. DEVELOPMENT. Twenty-one-year-old Virginia Wambura said she voted because of her love for the country. In Murang'a, Mr Victor Ndung'u, who is physically challenge, voted at Kiambamba Primary School. He had requested his family to hire a car for him to exercise his democratic right. According to Mr Ndung'u, failing to vote was tantamount to giving opportunity to bad leaders. The sick and disabled were given priority during voting. MOBILISERS. Business people in the county gave their employees the day off to go and vote. Bars and entertainment spots had been closed on Wednesday at 8pm to allow revellers time to participate in the poll. Only a few public transport vehicles were operating, with some increasing fare to take advantage of the situation. Local MPs led by Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) and Kanini Kega (Kieni) had hired 18,300 youth to mobilise voters across the villages in efforts to attain high turn out. Each of the 917 polling stations was 'guarded' by 20 mobilisers armed with a voter's register.

VMitsubishi\u2019s new crossover concept doesn\u2019t want to drive for you. It wants to make you a better driver. . Most automakers are building up AI systems to run their future self-driving cars. But Mitsubishi recently unveiled its slightly different tack at the Tokyo Motor Show. . Mitsubishi's new e-Evolution concept is an all-electric crossover vehicle that promises a stiff dose of AI power. The vehicle doesn't look too far off from another of the Motor Show's all-electric hits, the Nissan IMx concept \u2014 but Mitsubishi isn't embracing full-on autonomy like Nissan. . The concept is powered by three electric motors, which draw power from a battery under the vehicle's floor. Mitsubishi didn't provide horsepower estimates or battery range projections, though, so the design behind the four-wheel drive SUV isn't exactly fully realized. . Mitsubishi's boldest idea for the e-Evolution is plugging an AI assistant directly into the vehicle's interface, like something out of camp classic Knight Rider. The automaker describes the system as a tool that can make the human driver more effective by using sensors "to instantly read changes in road and traffic conditions, as well as the driver's intent." . It doesn't sound anything like the autonomous systems currently being developed by carmakers and tech companies around the world \u2014 Mitsubishi talks up a "special coaching function" that gives the AI system power to "transfer knowledge to the driver" somehow, so the company is definitely imagining a system that won't take the driver out of the equation. . There aren't any details available about exactly how Mitsubishi proposes to achieve the AI mind-meld, though \u2014 so this concept is largely just that: an idea. We'll take the Knight Rider experience sooner than later if we can though, please. .

VIf you're looking to pre-order an iPhone X, be aware that in the U.S., you'll need to wait until December to actually get the phone. . Right now, the shipping date for all variants of the device \u2014 64GB or 256GB, Silver or Space Gray \u2014 is five to six weeks. . Given the numerous rumors that Apple doesn't have nearly enough iPhone X units to satisfy demand, this actually isn't that bad, though with the U.S. just waking up, those shipping times might get extended further. . The pre-orders for the iPhone X on Apple's website opened at around 3 a.m. ET on Friday, and initially the shipping times were 2-3 weeks, but this quickly changed into 4-5 weeks, and then to 5-6 weeks. . In Apple's UK online store, the shipping time was 5-6 weeks for all variants of the phone right after pre-orders went live, and it hasn't changed since. . If you don't want to wait until December, you can still try and get an iPhone X in one of Apple's retail store on Nov. 3. That, however, will likely include waiting in a long, long line. .

V- Jermaine Jackson believes his brother Michael would have been nobody without \u2018Jackson 5'. - Jermaine is Michael\u2019s older brother and they were all members of the Jackson 5. - Jermaine\u2019s statement was due to Debbie Rowe\u2019s statement about Michael not thinking his brothers were talented. Jermaine Jackson is an American singer who was a member of the popular black group \u2018The Jackson 5\u2019. He was in the group with little brother Michael and according to Jermaine, his brother Michael who is popularly known as \u2018The King of Pop\u2019 would have been nobody without the group.  Michael Jackson started his music career at a very early age of 5 years. That career has been attributed to their father, Joseph Jackson, having a plan of making his children into stars and making sure they get a better life. So the \u2018Jackson 5\u2019 group was created.  In as much as that was where Michael started his career from, his talent blew everyone away instantly. And not long after the group was created, Michael became the heart of the Jackson 5. Well according to Jermaine, his brother wouldn\u2019t even have had a career at all. This statement was made after Jermaine was asked about Michael Jackson\u2019s ex-wife Debbie Rowe\u2019s comment about him and his brothers.  Debbie, who seems to want to have custody of Michael\u2019s children, Prince, Paris, and Blanket said that Michael told her that he didn\u2019t think his brothers had talent. Debbie also said the only member of the group he thought had talent is his younger sister Janet. Jermaine definitely wasn\u2019t pleased with the statement Debbie said his brother made. But what Jermaine didn\u2019t put into consideration was that his brother might not have made that comment at all.  Debbie also accused Jermaine of using MJ\u2019s kids to get money from his estate. Jermaine said the accusations were all lies and he has his own money as they are all very comfortable in the family with no one looking up at the other for financial means.

VAlgeria coach, Rabah Madjer is targeting a win in the inconsequential matchday-6 game of the 2018 FIFA World Cup African qualifying Group B against Nigeria at the Mohammed Hamlaoui Stadium in Constantine on November 10, Completesportsnigeria.com reports. Algeria are at the bottom of Group B on one point, while Nigeria have clinched the sole World Cup ticket with an unassailable 13 points. Zambia and Cameroon are in the second and third positions on seven and six points respectively. Madjer believes a win for his side will revive the confidence of his new team ahead of the 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifying campaign. Algeria and Benin Republic are joint leaders in Group D of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, while Gambia and Togo, without a point after the first round of matches, occupy third and fourth spots respectively. The Algerian legend who is in his third stint in charge of the Desert Foxes told Lagazette du Fennec: \u201cIf we start with a win over Nigeria, it will help the confidence qualifying for CAN 2019. I am very proud to have been chosen and to feel this confidence around me,\u201d Madjer said.\u200e. \u201cYes, I am attacked by journalists, by people on social networks. But I can assure you that I feel a lot of confidence from a majority of the public. I see it when I go out on the street. \u201cBut we know that I will be judged on the results. And so this match against Nigeria is very important.\u201d.

VSusan Sarandon was "perfectly fine" with Kate Winslet touching her cleavage at an awards ceremony. A photo of Kate reaching out to gently pat Susan's chest while actor Michael Shannon stood in the background emerged online following the 2016 Screen Actors Guild Awards, with the snap quickly going viral on social media outlets. . Kate previously explained that her action was "shameless" and spontaneous, and Susan shared during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night (26Oct17) that she wasn't bothered when the British star decided to cop a feel. . "I don't know if she was trying to see if they were real? It was lovely. (But) I felt bad for him (Michael) because he was kind of caught in the middle," she said, adding that the Titanic actress appeared to be in "awe" of her. . "We kind of feel like we know each other, the women that survive in this business for any amount of time. So, it felt perfectly fine, it didn't feel strange at all. I would have had a problem if it was a guy, I have to admit, that wouldn't have been welcome.". Over the course of her career, Susan has won acclaim for her roles in films such as The Client, Bull Durham and Stepmom. But there are a few films that fans constantly ask her about. . "The thing that I love the most is that there's some people that are like crazy for Thelma & Louise, some focus on The Rocky Horror Picture Show, some people love Dead Man Walking. And then there are people that loved me in Alien \u2013 and I wasn't in that so there you go," the 71-year-old stated, going on to share that she is often mistaken for Alien star Sigourney Weaver. . At present, Susan is promoting upcoming comedy A Bad Moms Christmas, which also stars Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn. And she only decided to join the cast after Kathryn sent her a handwritten note begging her to play her mother in the movie. . "Which of course I completely fell for because she was just so sweet," she added.

VLafarge Africa Plc.  To enhance safety in all its operations, Lafarge Africa Plc, is investing over \u20a6\u20a6132m to train truck drivers in Nigeria.According to the company, the first batch of 200 drivers to be trained will be part of a three-year strategic training plan for 600 drivers in the country. Director of Logistics at Lafarge Africa Plc, Bruno Hounkpati, said: \u201cThe primary aim of our Driving Institute is to model drivers\u2019 behaviour from the onset while equipping them with adequate training for truck driving. \u201cThe school will ensure skilled drivers with safe driving skills that contribute to safer roads in Nigeria. It will promote professionalism among truck drivers and also create jobs with our third party transport companies.\u201d. Road transportation accounts for 90 per cent of freight and passenger movement in Nigeria, with heavy good vehicles like trucks, trailers and articulated vehicles dominating the haulage modes. While the practice has been for most Nigerian truck drivers to graduate from motor mates with inadequate and structured training, Lafarge hopes to change the practice in a bid to discourage acts that impede fleet utilisation, safe driving behaviours, productivity and employment opportunities. In 2016, commercial vehicles accounted for 53.8 per cent of transportation in Nigeria, according to data compiled by the Federal Roads Safety Corp (FRSC). The data also shows that 8,876 commercial vehicles were involved in road accidents. The Head of the driving school, Osaze Aghatise said: \u201cOne major way to reduce road related incidents and achieve our goal of zero harm is to raise the standard of drivers\u2019 training in our operations and ensure drivers think about safety first and always while on the road. \u201cThis requires the right training and coaching to understand the risks involved in performing a task, to shape behaviours and to develop safety processes.\u201d. He added that the school is in partnership with Transport Services Limited, a fleet management company, and the FRSC, while selected trainees will go through an initial rigorous screening, thorough in-classroom training, state-of-the-art driving simulator and on-the-road coaching and assessment. \u201cLafarge has carefully selected the instructors with strong local and international experience, and certification to ensure trainees are taken through the highest standard of driver training. Going forward, Lafarge contractors will only use drivers from the school,\u201d he added.

VEFF leader Julius Malema will appear in a Bloemfontein court on Friday. Picture: Boxer Ngwenya. Johannesburg - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate\u2019s Court on Friday, on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act after calling for land invasions. In 2014, at the EFF elective conference in Bloemfontein, Malema told members that they should occupy the land. When appearing in court in Bloemfontein on those charges last year, he again told supporters who had gathered outside the court to take any \u201cbeautiful piece of land\u201d they saw because it was taken from blacks \u201cby genocide\u201d. Malema\u2019s legal team is disputing the constitutionality of the Riotous Assembly Act. The EFF has accused the State of using \u201capartheid-era laws\u201d to try to silence its critics. In a separate case, Malema appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate\u2019s Court in July, on common law charges of incitement to commit a crime. The charge sheet indicates that he is accused of trespassing in contravention of \u201cSection 1(1) Read as Section 2(1) of Trespass Act 6 of 1959 as amended by Criminal Law Amendment Act 59 of 1983\u201d. In June last year, Malema told supporters in Newcastle to occupy land because it belonged to blacks - and that whites could not claim ownership of land. He appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate\u2019s Court under the Riotous Assemblies Act and after the postponement, Malema stepped outside the court and told his supporters to \u201coccupy the land because they have failed to give you the land\u201d. \u201cIf it means going to prison for telling you to take the land, so be it. I am not scared of prison because of the land question, but I am scared of prison if I go to prison for corruption. I don\u2019t want to go to prison for corruption, but I want to go to prison for the land,\u201d he said at the time.

V Harry Wilson has spoken of his delight at being named the Premier League 2 Player of the Month for September. . The Welshman netted five goals across three appearances last month in the division as the U23s extended their winning start to 2017-18. The 20-year-old saw off competition from seven other nominees to clinch the Player of the Month prize. "I'm delighted to win the award; September was a great month for me personally and the team,\u201d Wilson told Liverpoolfc.com. "We picked up a lot of points and scored a lot of goals, so on a personal note it was great to score five goals in the league - and for the team to win every game was just as good.". After netting 28 times during the 2016-17 campaign, an Achilles injury picked up in pre-season disrupted Wilson\u2019s start to the new term. Asked to explain his rich vein of form in front of goal, Wilson said: "Just being in the right place at the right time. "The team provided me with the passes because without them I wouldn\u2019t be in those positions to score and when I get in there I\u2019m always confident I can put them away.". Wilson's highlight of the month was his first-half hat-trick in the 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on September 22. He said: "When you score a hat-trick, no matter where it is it\u2019s always special, but for it to be at Anfield under the lights and to be a perfect hat-trick as well made it that bit more special. "Playing for the U23s at Anfield and scoring a hat-trick against a side like Tottenham Hotspur has got to be up there amongst the best moments of my career so far.".

VRBS has posted nine straight years of losses since the financial crash of 2008. Royal Bank of Scotland has posted a profit of £392m ($514) for the third quarter, compared to an attributable loss of £469m in the same period a year ago. It marks the third straight quarter in which the lender, which is 71% owned by the government, has posted a profit. Operating profits came in at £871m for the July to September period, more than the £694m profit predicted by analysts. The better-than-expected results were driven by falling costs and fewer conduct charges compared to the third quarter of last year. Litigation and conduct costs fell to £125m from £425m a year ago, while restructuring costs slid to £244m from £469m. Year-to-date attributable profits came in at £1.3bn compared to a loss of £2.5bn in the first nine months of 2016. "Our strategy to deliver a simpler, safer, customer-focussed bank, is working," RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said. "We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues.". RBS has reported nine consecutive years of losses since the government spent £45bn to buy a majority stake in the bank in 2008. It agreed to pay a £4.2bn fine to the US Federal Housing Finance Agency earlier this year to settle charges that it mis-sold mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis. The lender is also under a separate investigation from the US Department of Justice over its mortgage-backed security sales, which is expected to result in a huge fine. RBS agreed to pay $44m to settle separate charges of securities fraud in the US on 26 October. The charges relate to RBS attempting to increase its profits at the expense of clients by misrepresenting prices and commissions in trades of mortgage-backed securities. Prosecutors said the scheme was conducted from 2008 to 2013 and that the bank's employees perpetrated it "with the knowledge, encouragement and participation of RBS supervisors".

VChelsea boss Antonio Conte has stated that Super Eagles forward Victor Moses and N\u2019Golo Kante have not recovered from injury. Moses was substituted in the first half of Chelsea\u2019s 2-1 away loss to Crystal Palace with a ham-string injury. Kante also went off in France\u2019s 1-0 away win against Bulgaria in the 2018 FIFA World Cup after picking up an hamstring injury also. While Moses has missed Chelsea\u2019s last three games, Kante has not featured in Chelsea\u2019s last fout games. Speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea\u2019s trip to Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, Conte however said Kante should be fit to face Roma in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. \u201cMoses and Kante are still unavailable for tomorrow\u2019s game. I hope to have Kante back for Roma,\u201d Conte said. \u201cWe have to try overcome this period. \u201cWe have faced a lot of problems. We are going well. We have the points we deserve.\u201d. Conte said that they will have to be wary of a dangerous Bournemouth side who have been impressive, while stating they hope to see former Chelsea duo Nathan Ake and Asmir Begovic. \u201cBournemouth are a really good team and we will need to pay great attention tomorrow.\u201d He said. \u201cWe are looking forward to seeing Nathan Ake and Asmir Begovic, two important players for us last season.\u201d. On whether Chelsea can replicate their 13-game winning run last season, Conte admitted it will be a tall order for them. He said: \u201cIt will be hard to repeat our 13-game winning sequence from last season as the Premier League is very difficult.\u201d. And responding to reports that Carlo Ancellotti is waiting to replace him at Chelsea because he\u2019s not getting on with the players, Conte said: \u201cIn the past, it\u2019s happened the same with the other managers. The stories try to create problems between me and the players. If people continue to write about this, I feel like I answered very well in the past about these issues.\u201d.

National Super Alliance (Nasa) leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka are yet to file responses in a contempt case filed against them by the Jubilee Party. When the parties appeared before Deputy Registrar Daniel ole Keiwua on Friday morning, they were informed that the two Nasa leaders were also yet to appoint lawyers to represent them in the case. CHEBUKATI. IEBC and Chairman Wafula Chebukati, on their part said, they were preparing for the repeat election, which was held on Thursday. Jubilee Party, through its Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, wants the two leaders jailed for six months for calling for mass protests with a view to stopping the poll ordered by the apex court on September 1. President Uhuru Kenyatta's party accuses Mr Odinga and Mr Musyoka of sabotaging the poll yet they are the ones who successfully petitioned for the nullification of the August 8 presidential results.
