VCastigates Govt for creating \u2018fear psychosis\u2019 among people _line_ KNS _line_Srinagar, Oct 09 (KNS): Peoples Democratic Front (PDF) Chairman and MLA Khansahib, Hakeem Muhammad Yaseen Monday castigated the PDP-BJP government for its failure to check mysterious braid chopping incidents in various parts of the Valley. In a statement issued to KNS, he said government has no right to be in place as it has utterly failed to remove fear among the people especially woman folk due to braid chopping incidents._line_ Hakeem has termed braid chopping incidents in various parts of the Kashmir valley as \u2018an insult to the respect of the womanhood\u2019._line_ He said increasing braid chopping incidents have put dignity of the sacred women at stake, which is totally unacceptable and unbearable. _line_ \u201cIt was most unfortunate and shameful that a sinister game plan has been leashed against our sisters and daughters who are scared to move out of their homes for routine work,\u201d MLA Khansahib said._line_ Hakeem Yaseen has said that the increasing incidents of braid chopping in various parts of the valley have put a question mark on the credibility of the present Government adding that the prevailing situation has upset the peace of mind of the people of Kashmir valley especially woman folk . \u201c one fails to understand why the Govt. is acting like mute spectator despite having a huge police and intelligence apparatus in its hands ,\u201d, Hakeem questioned adding that the finger of suspicion directly points towards the Government for the episode for reasons known to it._line_ Expressing serious concern over the continuous incidents of Braid Chopping, Hakeem Yaseen has said that the Government has utterly failed to un earth mystery behind such ugly and shameful incidents .

VWhy I posit the above is for this reason:_line_Back in May of 2014 I penned the article: \u201cDid Apple Just Become Microsoft?\u201d In it I made the following points. To wit:_line_\u201cHowever since the passing of Jobs, quite rightly, there has been an intense spotlight focused squarely on the Apple tradition going forward. Just what new products or changes to existing lines would be forth coming, and how will they be packaged for sale to an ever-increasing market._line_Everyone (and I mean everyone) understood that the new management structure at Apple would both need to pay homage to the ever-present shadow of Jobs while also needing to blaze or create new trails free of the ominous Jobs overhang. i.e., Something Jobs would say, \u201cWow, I never thought of that!\u201d as compared with nothing more than a refinement to an already Jobs inspired creation._line_However, it would seem we not only have the latter taking place, but is veering way off the path Apple has been so skillful in avoiding: Buying an also ran business. e.g., The Beats\u2122 headphone line. Some say it\u2019s for it\u2019s streaming music service or some other thing but if that is the case, not putting the money into a true revamp of iTunes seems even more as an un-Jobs move.\u201d_line_And here we are nearly 4 years later (or 4 product cycles, if you will) and what has been the result of this once \u201cfantastic\u201d partnership? When was the last time you heard anything or any buzz about Beats®? ____________ (insert crickets here.)_line_Oh, but wait you say, \u201cWhat about iTunes? It was updated as to allow easier downloading of apps and such for mobile.\u201d_line_Yes, yes it was. An update that most users will only encounter when they go to update or purchase something, then, find out they can\u2019t do it the way they\u2019ve been doing for-e-ver. i.e., \u201cOh, wait, I have to do this on my phone now, and not my computer? Wait, how do I\u2026? Wait\u2026what\u2026I mean\u2026WTF!\u201d_line_I believe this to be a blatant design faux pa. Why? Because if you look at the iTunes of today, it looks no different that it did years, and years ago. The only difference? The \u201cApps\u201d option is no longer there. This is to \u201creduce clutter\u201d via Apple\u2019s thinking._line_But the same old, tired, antiquated looking and seemingly lifeless iTunes of old? It\u2019s still there, but now with less clutter \u2013 so you can see more clearly how lame it has become due to design atrophy._line_Most will only notice the \u201credesign\u201d when they go to use it the way they\u2019ve been using it habitually, only to find it no longer is possible. And the design cues that would intuitively make someone take notice immediately, that maybe there\u2019s something new going on? That too is completely absent. Along with the old way of doing it._line_In my opinion, that\u2019s such a design faux pa it\u2019s unconscionable, especially, for any company where \u201cdesign\u201d is so front and center. (Please don\u2019t tell me about the little pop up to tell you somethings \u201cnew.\u201d Again, please! If that\u2019s the extent for \u201cdesign?\u201d I\u2019ll just leave it at that.)_line_It (meaning iTunes) looks, feels, and performs (as in it\u2019s completely outdated and still clunky to the point of frustrating) as the same old, same old, old iTunes it\u2019s been since Jobs passed._line_Sorry, but I still can not get over just how pathetic this all so important portal to one of the most important selling points Apple has to both consumers, developers, and Wall Street has become. Hint: Ecosystem is (or was) for all intents and purposes the iTunes portal to everything Apple. Period._line_Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean that Apple (aka \u201cCook and company\u201d) didn\u2019t make sweeping changes and innovations to many of Apple\u2019s once empirical red lines. Again, from the same article To wit_line_One of the first signs that Cook and company were going to do things very differently was when they announced that Apple which had for years steered clear of donating or giving away resources (as in donations) abruptly reversed Jobs stance and stated very publicly they would now begin contributing to education and other charities._line_Whether one agrees with this decision or not is irrelevant. It was the first very public statement showing there was a true sea change transpiring in Cupertino. I myself wrote about this and more that it seemed to be shaping up to look more concerned for public image in the eyes of political groups as well as Wall Street than anything else. It\u2019s beginning to look like both my concerns as well as others might be coming into fruition.\u201d_line_Here\u2019s a little more from the same article, for a bit more context, because it\u2019s germane to this discussion. Again, to wit:_line_\u201cNext is what has been seen by many as a complete and utter cave in to Wall Street._line_In what seems like a total collapse to these outside pressures it was announced at the last earnings report the new product line wasn\u2019t consumer product based: it was now products for Wall Street with new improvements and features unfathomable under Jobs tenure._line_Dividends, debt, splits, and more. I don\u2019t think the iPhone has added as many new features at once as the new features released in Apple the stock._line_And here we are, again, nearly 4 years later and what has been the empirical evidence that my assumptions were correct? Once again, to wit:_line_And how about that \u201cpolitical\u201d argument I brought forth? _line_Surely no CEO worth-their-salt would ever be seen throwing not only himself, but his company, along with its employees into the political fray intentionally. Especially when the evidence for it clearly showed the accusations were a bit more than specious._line_Again, what prudent CEO would ever willingly set up an \u201cus vs them\u201d to be played out within its customer base? I mean that\u2019s Business 101, correct? Well, it is, but it\u2019s now also Silicon Valley 2.0, which has become anything but a fundamental business ethos. And this is Cook and Co., not Jobs and crew. Here are a few headlines to ponder. To wit:_line_Don\u2019t like that headline? Fair enough, you can see it, as well as be asked for it in, da, da, da, dahhhh: iTunes itself. To wit:_line_(Screenshot from above noted source)_line_Some are thinking right now, \u201cI thought it was about Nazi\u2019s, not pro-life?\u201d Yes, that\u2019s what was touted, but that\u2019s the problem when one decides to do anything via the political, for sometimes, more often than not, you don\u2019t know whom \u2013 is in bed \u2013 with whom._line_That\u2019s why the business default is always to not involve yourself, at least publicly. (Remember: the accusations, along with the evidence for it was iffy to begin with, and proved to be completely untrue when examined rationally away from the political eye.)_line_To be clear: what one does in private is another matter entirely. But the cardinal rule of business is, has, and should remain: Never, ever, ever (did I say never?) openly involve your company, employees, and their collective coffers into the political. Period. Full stop._line_Once you add the political to business \u2013 you\u2019re not only asking for troubling, but your courting it. And what\u2019s worse is this: Just like the old saying of \u201cThe camel\u2019s nose under the tent.\u201d Once it sticks its nose in, more of it, and in greater quantity, will follow till eventually there\u2019s nothing left inside but the camel._line_If you believe there\u2019s any doubt to that scenario just look to the current debacle within not only the NFL®, but ESPN\u2122 and sports in general. Ratings, ticket sales, and more are being boycotted in one form or another, in droves. (something I stated in 2015 would result when everyone else said otherwise)_line_And the worst is far from over, because these entities are doubling down on the political even further. i.e., They\u2019re confusing the political uproar as some form of \u201croar from the field,\u201d and playing too it. The issue is, that \u201croar\u201d could very well spell \u201cThe End\u201d of what had been a near magical run._line_No comparison for Apple you say, as in, apples-and-oranges? Fair enough, so explain this, again, to wit:_line_The above screenshot image was taken from the Zero Hedge\u2122 article, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Just China: No Lines For New iPhone 8 Virtually Anywhere\u201d_line_And just to put the above into further context. Here\u2019s a pull quote from the afore-mentioned article, again, to wit:_line_\u201cAccording to CBS LA, the Pasadena store was also missing a line of eager fans. Previous releases of the iPhone attracted hundreds of Apple fans waiting in the early morning hours at several stores across Southern California. The Apple Store has a ticketing system, but that never stopped eager iPhone fans from camping out overnight. But on Friday morning, all was quiet on Colorado Boulevard, except for employees inside the store handing out tickets.\u201d_line_I know it\u2019s possibly a little bit of a stretch, but it has to be asked: Do you think that maybe there were a few people who were just a little bit ticked off at Apple\u2019s new-found political stance, and maybe decided they would take a stand and not show up for Apple\u2019s newest \u201cshiny thing?\u201d_line_If it was just one, that\u2019s infinitely more than what did show up since Mr. Cook\u2019s new declaration for Apple\u2019s political involvement. (i.e., as in 1 paying customer is infinitely better than none.)_line_People (especially the next-in-rotation fund-manger crowd) are attributing that it\u2019s because they\u2019re all waiting for the \u201cX.\u201d Fair point, but that doesn\u2019t mean some customers aren\u2019t unhappy. And let\u2019s remember: no one knows at this point, it has to all be speculated._line_But here\u2019s the real issue: the only thing to use as evidence to build any theory \u2013 is this latest roll out. And so far disaster seems to be an understatement. And the proximity of Mr. Cook\u2019s political stance, along with call for action, combined with the empirical results showing up in other venues of business elsewhere? Are you beginning to see my point?_line_Apple the stock is currently teetering in \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d territory. Any damage to its \u201cperfection\u201d thesis gets multiplied exponentially. Multiplied as in \u201cprofit takers\u201d show up in droves at the sell window, not the sales counter at first sign that the thesis is indeed hindered._line_Should this take place with Apple\u2019s continuous lack of innovations, dumbing down of existing products (see any forum of Apple power users) and continuing focus on both Tim Cook, his political stances, along with his pushing the involvement of Apple the company, its employees, and coffers into the political fray, simultaneously against a backdrop of uninspiring (think Pencil®), clichéd (think: any Apple presentation), openly mocked, (think: when demos were conducted on stage via Microsoft employees) laughed at, (think: CNET\u2122 live coverage of any event) as well as live product demos gone wrong, (think: face recognition) displays on the world stage. This is a string of \u201chits\u201d no one any wants, especially current share holders._line_Should the stock now falter, along with any iPhone rumblings confirming sales numbers will look like what the latest roll out last month foretold? Watch how fast things not only change from the narrative of \u201cgreat stewardship,\u201d but calls for management change begin to bubble to the surface in unison._line_In my opinion, Tim Cook really doesn\u2019t have a lot things to hang-his-hat on, along with hold-his-chair, but for Apple\u2019s stock price under his tutelage._line_Everything else since the passing of Jobs has been nothing more than a derivative of what Jobs had already begun or envisioned for the near future. And some will say that derivative has been more of a dumbing down of the original products, rather than a raising the bar. See \u201cHow Apple Is Giving Design A Bad Name\u201d for clues._line_These are not the types of things one wants to think of when thinking about Apple, yet, it\u2019s coming more front-and-center, and front-of-mind daily._line_Using myself as an example, for I am still an Apple user: I just replaced and upgraded two of my Macs. That upgrade consisted of upgrading two older models \u2013 to two 2012 models. Spending 3 times the price to only get only a negligible, or rather, imperceptible performance difference seemed ludicrous. The issue? I can afford the newest, and didn\u2019t even bother. How many are like me I have to wonder. I\u2019ll garner there are more than even I think._line_The only thing that has helped hold up, or bolster, Apple\u2019s mythical overhang of design excellence instilled under Jobs these years since he passed has been its current share price._line_Lose the share price plateau? The mythical overhang falls way with it. Why? Because it\u2019s just not there._line_Again, for this is far too important of a point: it\u2019s been the CEO, Tim Cook himself, that has not just allowed, but pushed all of this front-and-center as to now be included into any, and all, calculations of sales and valuations._line_Think about that very carefully, it\u2019s that important, as well as a mind-boggling foolish CEO misstep from a business viewpoint._line_It could very well be Mr. Cook made a political calculation which may result in not just bad timing, but also, a step too far. And one that leads him himself out the very door he entered, unable to fill the shoes for innovation which are sorely missed._line_Sometimes, nothing focuses the mind like a crisis \u2013 and maybe what Apple desperately needs is something to focus on besides its management resting on its laurels, and stock options, all while looking out upon vistas from within its own big new \u201cshiny thing\u201d they now call home to contemplate what politically calculated move is to be made next._line_Maybe it\u2019s time to focus on the product, rather than the political. Or maybe better yet\u2026_line_Hoist out a pirate flag, plant it, and actually do something under it other than contemplate which new superlative will be used to describe a stylus._line_

VThe Uday Kotak-led committee on corporate governance's proposal to put in place a common 'stewardship code\u2019 might compel Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and top mutual funds (MFs) to play a more active role in this regard. _line_At present, there is no specific provision for such a code under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations. For MFs, some stewardship principles have been adopted, such as on voting and conflict of interest. In March, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) issued a stewardship code for companies in its ambit._line_Related Stories _line_ Widgets Magazine  _line_\u201cOver the years, disclosure on the voting patterns of MFs have gradually improved and insurance companies are now likely to come under increasing pressure to start voting on shareholder resolutions," says Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, an advisory entity on corporate governance._line_\u201cThe (proposed) code will make it a formal mandate for institutional investors to play a stewardship role, rather than remain silent spectators with respect to the affairs of their investee companies," says Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at consultancy KPMG India._line_Source: Sebi committee\u2019s report on corporate governance 2017_line_Sebi has been pushing MFs to vote on shareholder resolutions since 2010 \u2014 from having a voting policy to disclosing their voting rationale. In the process, MFs\u2019 abstention from voting on shareholder resolutions was down to 10 per cent in 2016 from earlier levels of over 80 per cent, says proxy advisory IiAS._line_While laws have empowered minority shareholders on a number of counts, such rights have not been effectively put to use by them, barring some instances where their influence has been evident, say experts. \u201cInsurers have been inconsistent in voting on shareholder resolutions. While some are proactive and have been voting, others have waited for a regulatory push," observes a recent report from IiAS._line_According to Subramanian, minority shareholders can use regulations such as the new Bankruptcy Code or provisions in the Companies Act to raise concern on financial wrongdoing. However, the objectives can only be achieved if institutional investors such as MFs and insurance companies lend support, he said._line_In 2014, for instance, seven fund houses had got together to oppose Maruti Suzuki\u2019s proposed deal to transfer an upcoming Gujarat factory to parent Suzuki Motor Corp of Japan._line_There could be practical difficulties in implementing a stewardship code. First, MFs manage liquid assets for several companies, in hundreds of crore. \u201cFund houses will think twice before going against the management of these companies \u2014 the latter might withdraw the amounts parked in these funds. Second, many MFs and insurance companies are themselves owned by large corporates," observes Subramanian._line_A stewardship code will help institutional investors to engage constructively with companies on matters ranging from strategy, governance and performance to risk management. \u201cThe form of engagement could vary from periodic meetings with the company management to taking normal board positions, where possible, and also through voting at shareholder meetings. Once institutional shareholders take on an active role, the benefits will percolate to retail (small) shareholders," said Venkateshwaran._line_According to IiAS, an engagement mechanism \u2014 one that entails connecting with the management of investee companies with regard to strategy and performance, as well as environmental, social and governance issues \u2014 is less tangible than voting on shareholder resolutions. \u201cThe outcomes of these discussions are not easily quantifiable and the success of these efforts might be less measurable. However, engagement efforts have yielded results in the past," goes its report._line_

VDon\u2019t just focus on making your car look great on the outside, also make sure you are treating the inside with equal care and attention. If you want to prolong the showroom quality of the interior of your car, start thinking about Car Detailing in North Vancouver even as soon as you buy your vehicle. So many people miss out on that small window of opportunity to hold on to the \u201cnew\u201d look of their vehicles. As a result, the interior of their vehicles quickly lose their brand new appearance. _line_Here are some dos and don\u2019ts about interior car detailing in North Vancouver you would want to consider:_line_1. Do invest on good quality cleaning products. _line_The problem with standard cleaners is that they might do more harm than good to the interior components of your vehicle. When it comes to interior car detailing in North Vancouver, buy products and equipment intended for car interior cleaning use. That means going the extra mile in looking for a carpet vacuum or a specific cleaning product for your leather upholstery._line_2. Don\u2019t just use any leather cleaning product. _line_If your car has leather upholstery, it\u2019s important to determine what kind of leather it is so you can buy the correct cleaning product. The information should be readily available but if you can\u2019t find it on your car\u2019s manual or the manufacturer\u2019s website, do a simple test. Put a drop of water on the leather seat. If the water gets absorbed quickly, it\u2019s aniline leather. If it takes quite some time before the water is absorbed, it\u2019s semi-aniline leather. If the water gets repelled, you most likely have corrected grain or full-grain leather._line_3. Do have the car seats cleaned once a month. _line_Dirt can easily get stuck in the fibers of the car seat and on the surface of leather seats. The dirt particles can become abrasive and can cause the upholstery to look faded quickly. Having the car seats cleaned once a month it one way of ensuring that your car\u2019s upholstery will remain looking like new for a long time._line_4. Don\u2019t forget to get professional car detailing once every 2-3 months. _line_It\u2019s advisable to get car detailing in North Vancouver every 2-3 months. Having this done professionally by body shops such as Elite Body Shop can help keep your car\u2019s interior in great condition._line_5. Do keep the leather parts of your car conditioned. _line_Make sure the conditioner is bereft of things like silicone and petroleum. It should contain only natural oils to avoid having that unwanted greasy surface on the leather seats. _line_These are the things you can do to ensure that your car\u2019s interior will look new all the time. Nothing beats getting in a car that is clean and is devoid of unwanted smell. _line_Steven Drew is the author of this article.

VWe hope car companies keep making them as long as possible_line_ There are many things we like about our 2018 Jaguar F-Pace long-term car, as well as some things we don't care for, but easily one of the best things about it is the engine. Under the hood is the 380-horsepower supercharged V6 that Jaguar offers on other models. That amount of power would be fun in just about any car with any engine, but there are specific reasons why this particular engine is special, and it's because of that supercharger._line_ Supercharged engines have a very different character than increasingly common turbo engines. One of the most noticeable differences being engine response. Unlike turbo engines, the F-Pace's V6 feels hardwired to your foot. Every extra millimeter of pedal travel yields a slightly greater amount of tug. And the tug is felt immediately. Even the best turbo engines have a hard time recreating this response. The power band is very linear, as well, so you know exactly what you're getting every time you hit the gas._line_ The engine is wonderfully torquey, too. Because the Jaguar's engine uses a classic Roots-type blower, there's a major improvement in low-end torque. This means that our F-Pace has loads of grunt for punting around at low-rpm and can seriously move when tromping on the gas. And because of the near-instant throttle response and linear power band, it doesn't slam you in the back unexpectedly like some turbo engines do._line_ Despite how great these supercharged engines are to experience, we're concerned that supercharged engines like this may disappear in all but ultra-limited production, high-performance cars such as the Chevy Corvette Z06 and Cadillac CTS-V. The reason being that car companies have to keep making cars more fuel efficient and lower emitting. Putting a supercharger on an engine is adding a handicap, since it takes engine power to spin the belt-driven supercharger. And when a turbo, which uses wasted energy from exhaust gas to spin the compressor and built boost, can effectively do the same thing, it's hard to make a case for a supercharger._line_ We won't give up hope completely, though. Mazda is using superchargers on its spark-assisted compression ignition gasoline engines. And while we're not sure how powerful and sporty those will be, Mazda has said that it's going with superchargers for exactly the reasons we like the Jaguar engine: smooth power and fast throttle response. They're also expected to be 10- to 30-percent more efficient than regular gasoline engines, so they should meet regulations for a while into the future. Until those engines roll out though, we'll continue to enjoy the one in our Jag._line_

VCrabbe scored 14 points on a minutes restriction and on a recovering sprained ankle. Both he and Kenny Atkinson agree: the fit is perfect._line_BROOKLYN, N.Y. \u2014 Five-and-a-half minutes into the Nets\u2019 117-83 win over the New York Knicks on Sunday, Allen Crabbe made his debut in Brooklyn black and white. It was almost 15 months after the start date he and Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson envisioned, but the ex-Trail Blazer played as if he\u2019d been waiting for this moment for a lifetime._line_Crabbe scored 14 points on five-of-seven shooting against the Knicks, but 11 of those 14 came off the bench in the first quarter. He probably would have gone for gold if he wasn\u2019t on a minutes restriction after recovering from a sprained ankle._line_Crabbe\u2019s performance was a reminder that Brooklyn \u2014 a team that jacked up the third-most three-pointers at one of the league\u2019s worst percentages last season \u2014 successfully addressed one of its glaring needs on the wing this summer. It was also a note that in Atkinson\u2019s pace-and-space system, the 25-year-old wing may be exactly what Brooklyn needs to jumpstart its offense._line_\u201cJust watching the first two preseason games, watching all the shots and watching how the offense flows, it\u2019s a perfect system,\u201d Crabbe said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feel here. When the coaches are telling you to do more, to shoot more. It\u2019s like the ultimate green light. So I\u2019m out there just playing basketball freely.\u201d_line_Added Atkinson: \u201cWe often talk about system fit. So we targeted Allen and said this is a guy who would fit in our system. Tonight is a good start. It was exactly kind of what we thought. Hopefully he can continue that as he gets healthier into the regular season.\u201d_line_It wasn\u2019t that long ago Allen Crabbe\u2019s Nets career was put on hold _line_Crabbe entered restricted free agency last summer as a coveted two-way wing who averaged 10 points on 39 percent three-point shooting with Portland in the 2015-16 season. Atkinson and Nets GM Sean Marks identified him as a perfect fit for their system and culture, so they lobbed a massive four-year, $75 million offer sheet his way._line_He signed it, and the Trail Blazers matched the offer, which was front-loaded and included a 15 percent trade kicker. _line_Crabbe spent one more season in Portland and morphed into the second-most efficient three-point shooter behind Kyle Korver, averaging 10.7 points on 44.4 percent shooting from downtown._line_But despite his relative success last year, Portland had $110 million in guaranteed contracts with young star Jusuf Nurkic\u2019s contract extension nearing next summer. So instead of eating a hefty luxury tax bill, the Trail Blazers dealt Crabbe to the Nets for Andrew Nicholson, whose contract they waived shortly after._line_Now, Crabbe and the Nets could be a perfect match_line_Prior to tip-off, Atkinson said he was excited to see Crabbe suit up because he is a low-usage, high-efficiency player, who competes on defense and doesn\u2019t need the ball to be effective. _line_In case you didn\u2019t know, those are the best types of players to have on your team._line_But the Trail Blazers may not have thought so, and if they did, they weren\u2019t willing to bite the financial bullet needed to keep him around. Brooklyn was \u2014 they offered him the deal in the first place \u2014 and now, Crabbe says it\u2019s his time to shine._line_\u201cIt\u2019s a different outlook that they have on me here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want me to do more, it\u2019s a bigger role here. So I\u2019m for the challenge. This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for, so I\u2019m gonna make things happen.\u201d_line_Yes, it\u2019s only the preseason. And yes, anything done against the Knicks\u2019 defense should be taken with 1/100 of a grain of salt. But Crabbe\u2019s hot shooting and active hands made the Barclays Center erupt in the first quarter. _line_.@allencrabbe was COOKING in his Nets debut! #WeGoHard pic.twitter.com/vR5gAfcDwT_line_\u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) October 9, 2017 _line_ALLEN CRABBE ON FIRE ALREADY pic.twitter.com/o9FToB4CSg_line_\u2014 TM (@madkidpalmcity) October 8, 2017 _line_Knicks had no answer for Allen Crabbe pic.twitter.com/WzkSm3OFvF_line_\u2014 sarutofu (@sarutofu) October 9, 2017 _line_That\u2019s a tall order for a Brooklyn crowd known to cheer Nets\u2019 opponents more often than not._line_After all, this is the guy Atkinson and Marks targeted almost 15 months ago.

VHow do you know stocks are a little overextended? A good indicator is when even the most bullish sellside analyst on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson, whose year-end price target of 2,700 is the highest of all his peers, warns that stocks may see "pullback or consolidation" and that the coming earnings season may be a "sell the news event."_line_Looking at the recent surge in the S&P, Wilson writes that broad stock index had gotten ahead of itself, reaching the low end of the bank's short term target (2550-75) for the index prior to earnings beginning (it hit 2,552 earlier this morning). He attributed this rush to buy stocks on the "too low" consensus forecast for Q3 EPS: _line_The consensus bottom-up forecast for 3Q S&P 500 is just 2.6% and appears too low. A strong 1H and a reluctance of corporates to raise guidance meant that mechanically 2H numbers needed to drift lower. With continued strength in economic growth and momentum in our proprietary leading earnings indicator we think companies will once again deliver versus consensus expectations. Look for continued contribution to overall earnings growth from Tech, Energy, and Financials (ex-Insurance). Accounting changes may also bring forward some earnings recognition, further supporting earnings growth. While the market will be focused on earnings over the next few weeks, bigger picture, NTM EPS estimates continue to rise, which should be a bigger driver of the market's direction._line_Looking past calendar year 2017, Wilson underscores the departure observed previously in that twelve month forward earnings have continued their upward trend, instead of being dragged sharply lower, "so the upward trend in NTM EPS is an important factor to consider when thinking about the primary direction of the market." Indeed, 2017 and 2018 so far appear different from the past three years, which saw zero EPS growth and the only upside in the S&P was due to multiple expansion, i.e., central bank liquidity. This time may be different... unless of course there is a sharp economic decline, which would lead to - you guessed it - an earnings drop._line_As a result, Wilson believes that "stocks correctly recognized this low bar a few weeks ago and rallied sharply into earnings season--a familiar pattern this year"_line_They also rallied a little too far, and so Wilson says the he "would expect to see a pull back or consolidation as earnings are actually reported--i.e. a sell the news event." But don't worry: the next move is the "next surge" in the S&P "toward the bank's 1Q 2018 target of 2700"._line_But before that, there are several downside risks stocks have to get over. First, is the potential impact of recent hurricanes on insurers (& financials), which as Goldman noted yesterday, will be a source of Y/Y Earnings decline this quarter: _line_Here's Morgan Stanley:_line_Financials has been a source of strength for earnings growth all year long, but for 3Q the sector actually has a negative contribution to overall market earnings growth. Fundamentals trends did not change on a dime. Rather, cat losses for P&C insurance firms related to the hurricanes are a major drag on the sector. Ex-Insurance, Financials are contributing 40+ bps to the earnings growth rate. Growth looks strongest among the banks as cost cutting continues and the rate environment is more supportive. With Insurance, Financials takes ~140 bps off of 3Q y/y EPS growth. This story has not fully played out yet. Our P&C Insurance Analyst, Kai Pan, has noted that not all companies have yet announced loss estimates, sell side analysts may not have yet adusted numbers, and there are substantial uncertainties around any estimates embedded in numbers that have been updated. On a forward looking basis though, major cat losses tend to position insurers well to pass along rate increases, which can be a tail wind for some in the sector assuming normalization of the forward cat losses._line_Another potential concerns is what happens after Q4, when comps get harder and the bar to beat jumps substantially higher, however two things could make such comps attainable: a continued USD weakness, and passage of the Trump tax reform which would cut corporate taxes:_line_Expectations for 4Q and beyond start to look harder to achieve given they are all for double digit growth rates and will be lapping harder comps (Exhibit 8). For example, 4Q17, currently projected around 11%, is lapping a ~4% growth comp in 4Q16. In addition to underlying economic growth, two additional forces can help make these numbers more achievable: the USD and tax reform. _line_With respect to the USD, the currency did not really have its rapid appreciation until the last quarter of 2016. This means that 4Q17 is where we start comping against the stronger USD. The DXY is down just over 2% on a y/y base but over 8% from the end of the year. The DXY could rise a bit into year end and still be down several percent y/y. We addressed this in July noting that 1) y/y weakness in the DXY tends to correlate with revenue growth and earnings revisions breadth and 2) that our quantitative equity research colleagues estimated that every 1 percent fall y/y in the dollar equates to roughly ½ percentage point of additional forward EPS growth. _line_A lower corporate tax rate, which is still our base case, will be a boost for earnings. We have estimated that a 25% corporate tax rate would help lift 2018 earnings by about 6%. Increased investment and late cycle activity as a result of tax reform could also help lift organic growth. _line_If USD and a lower tax rate alone can help add a mid-single digit contribution to earnings growth, it is not unreasonable to think that next year's higher targets are achievable._line_Finally, Wilson writes that one additional final factor that may drag equities lower in the near-term, one which Warren Buffett suggested a week or so ago, is tax Loss Selling. _line_As we head into 4Q, tax loss selling becomes a possible source of technical pressure on some stocks. We screen the S&P 1500 for tax loss selling candidates, looking for stocks that may have been well-liked to start the year and that have seen substantial price declines. Our screening methodology has produced a -2.3% average and -1.6% median return in calendar 4Q over the last 15 years and appears to yield further underperformance than just a screen of stocks with similar price declines. This year, the screen produces a list of 62 stocks._line_The screen of stocks most likely to see tax-loss related selling according to MS is shown below._line_

V Trials and tribulations have the ability to make us realise our inner strength. As they say, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. _line_ Life dealt a heavy blow to Smilie Suri when her marriage with dancer Vineet Bangera hit a rocky patch. Adding to her emotional trauma and depression were health woes like PCOD and thyroid. However, rather than accepting defeat, the actress regained her grip on life with pole dance, and has now turned into a full-fledged trainer of the dance form. _line_ She says, "I was battling depression when I found pole dance, and it has brought me a lot of emotional stability. I don't feel the need for anyone to back me up anymore. Of course, I still have days when I cry myself to sleep, but all that it takes to wipe away my blues is one student sharing how confident and independent she feels after learning it." _line_ Smilie's tryst with pole dance began by chance, after her aerial dance class got cancelled one day. She recalls, "It made me feel sexy and empowered; my weight no longer bothered me. I liked it so much that I decided to pursue it professionally. I even underwent a seven-week training program in Singapore, in pole, chair and static pole dance. That experience changed me completely \u2014 it was like finding a parallel universe. Till then, I was mostly surrounded by boys (brother Mohit Suri and cousin Emraan Hashmi), but all my classmates there were girls. I found sisterhood, feminine energy and became a girl again." _line_ Pole dance is often looked down upon, as it is associated with strippers. Smilie clarifies, "Both Bollywood and Hollywood are responsible for stereotyping it. Pole dance involves a lot of balancing, hand and head stands. It was done by strippers, but it has become a sport now. The need of the hour is to practise it like a sport and get fit. And what's wrong with feeling sexy? Ours is the land of Kamasutra. In my academy, I teach Bolly pole as every girl likes dancing to Bollywood numbers. The idea came about after my sister-in-law (Udita Goswami) insisted that I teach her pole dance to a Bollywood number." _line_ Interestingly, Smilie's family too was averse to her learning it in the beginning. She reveals, "My family thought that I had gone cuckoo, but eventually, they came around. Mohit and Emraan told me to promote fitness through it and not pursue it as a dance \u2014 they probably must have been to bars and seen it (laughs). When I ran short of money and was starving in Singapore \u2014 I didn't eat for a couple of days as I was saving up to buy a competition-grade pole \u2014 Mohit sent me money. Emraan also supported me emotionally, whenever I had a breakdown after eight-hour-long training sessions. Now, I plan to start a pole-conditioning class for men. I will start with my brothers, Mohit, Emraan, Kunal Deshmukh and Aditya Dutt." _line_

His feeling of dejection is understandable and that's the reason he is speaking like this, the CPI-M leader said._line_ Shah had on October 3 launched a blistering attack on Vijayan, holding him responsible for the killings of RSS and BJP activists in Kerala._line_ I pity the failed efforts of Shah, who is the President of a party that rules the country and who tried his best to impose the RSS agenda on Kerala and has failed, Vijayan said. _line_ He said it was most unfortunate that he led a march to the office of another national party (CPI-M). He called this nothing but a blatant violation of democratic principles._line_ On Monday, the Communist Party of India-Marxist protested against the Bharatiya Janata Party all across the country._line_ --IANS_line_ sg/mr _line_

VAre you looking forward to get pregnant and start a new family with your husband? If yes, then you need to take a few precautions to make sure that your pregnancy period goes well._line_There are various things that you might be doing currently and you need to stop those activities immediately. Things like alcohol, cigarettes, and tobacco are extremely toxic, and they can prove too poisonous for you and the foetus. If you have any such bad habits and trying to conceive, then read the following points to know more about the ill-effects of such habits._line_Quit Smoking Immediately_line_If you have been smoking cigarettes or tobacco in any other form, then stopping it before pregnancy is the most ideal thing to do. Smoking raises the chances for miscarriage, untimely birth and low-birth-weight. Furthermore, it also expands the likelihood of your child developing issues later on, such as asthma._line_If you think that you can\u2019t stop, in that case, at least make an attempt to reduce the quantity of cigarettes you smoke, and take additional care to eat well. Your gynecologist can give you helpful tips on the most effective method to stop or decrease smoking cigarettes. Even if you\u2019re not a smoker, keep in mind that long exposure to second-hand smoke is likewise unsafe._line_Important Note: Remember, it\u2019s important for you to find the most experienced gynec for your treatment, and for that you need to make a list of the best female gynecologists in Mumbai, and then get more information about them._line_Say No To Alcohol_line_Pregnant moms are strongly advised to stay away from any form of liquor. If you drink, the foetus becomes more exposed to risks such as infections, birth defects, infant mortality, and growth inadequacies._line_Infants born to women who frequently consume liquor may suffer from physical and intellectual damage, a health issue known as FAS (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome)._line_Since it isn\u2019t known whether there is a safe least amount of liquor which can be consumed without involving any risk, it is better to stay away from liquor completely during your pregnancy period. By deciding not to consume alcohol while you\u2019re pregnant, you increase the infant\u2019s chances of having a healthy life._line_Use Medicines Cautiously_line_It\u2019s also crucial to practice caution when it comes to intake of medicines. Some generally utilised medications, including non recommended drugs as aspirin, and even other common medicines, have been connected to birth abnormalities. This is why it becomes so important to find the best gynec._line_With proper research, you\u2019ll surely find the best gynec in Mumbai, who can help you to conceive and cure all other infertility problems._line_

V  Boeing and Emirates  _line_ Dubai is a glistening metropolis of stupefying landmarks, golden dunes and world-famous shopping. _line_Dubai: it's big and brash, flashy and ostentatious. It's a super-car traffic jam on a big-city street. It's a $1000 bottle of champagne when a cheap sparkling would do. It's the biggest, the best and the most expensive of everything._line_At least, that's what people expect when they arrive in this Middle Eastern metropolis. Dubai is supposed to be small on culture, and big on bling. It's here for a good time, not a long time, and it doesn't mind telling you so._line_The food is good, and it's cheap_line_Dubai's architecture is impressive._line_Thanks to a large immigrant population, including a huge influx of people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and Jordan, Dubai has an incredibly good and affordable food scene. Simply wander the streets of Deira, one of the city's older and cheaper neighbourhoods, and you'll find tasty treats from around the world, available on the street for only a few dirhams. And for the best Pakistani food this side of Lahore, call past the suburb of Satwa to dine at the shabby-but-famous Ravi restaurant._line_It's also good, and expensive_line_Dubai at night, with view of Burj Khalifa._line_Dubai has a reputation for fine-dining excellence, and it certainly lives up to that, with plenty of celebrity chefs from around the world setting up outposts in hotels and resorts across the city. You'll have to lay down some serious coin to enjoy meals by the likes of Nobu Matsuhisa, Gordon Ramsay, Gary Rhodes, Jamie Oliver, Marco Pierre White and Sanjeev Kapoor, but it will be worth the expense._line_There aren't many locals_line_This takes a while to sink in for most first-time visitors: the fact that there don't seem to be any local Emiratis around at all. That's due to a few factors, most notably that only 11 per cent of Dubai's population is Emirati. The local culture, too, is quite a private one, meaning for many visitors the only Emirati they'll meet will be the one who stamps their passport at the airport. Those keen to learn more about local culture, however, should call in to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (cultures.ae)._line_Shopping in the shouk is cheap._line_You can drink. A lot._line_Yes, there are laws against public inebriation, alcohol is extremely expensive, you have to be over 21 to drink it, and it's only served in bars attached to hotels or clubs. But that doesn't mean no one imbibes in Dubai. Any traveller expecting to have a dry holiday will be very surprised to find champagne brunches, happy hour drinks prices, and an expat culture of party-friendly boozing._line_The weekend begins on Friday \u2013 with brunch_line_Fine dinning: The Yuan Chinese restaurant at the Atlantis The Palm in Dubai._line_Why are the cafes and restaurants packed on a Friday morning, when everyone should be at work? This is the Islamic world, which means weekends are Fridays and Saturdays. Among the Dubai expat crowd, as well as many short-term visitors, the beginning of the weekend means one thing: brunch. And this is no light snack; Friday brunches are typically vast feasts as sumptuousness as they are boozy. Many hotels put on huge buffets of every food imaginable on which you can gorge yourself before lurching back to the hotel room for a snooze._line_There's history in Dubai_line_It's true: 50 years ago this heaving metropolis was little more than a creekside fishing village (before oil was discovered). But that doesn't mean there isn't history in Dubai. The oldest part of the city is al-Fahidi, a well-preserved cultural area that dates back to the early 1900s. The narrow alleyways and traditional homes here are a pleasant break from the skyscrapers and superhighways of Dubai proper._line_Holidaymakers visit a beach area on the waterfront outside the Jumeirah Beach hotel._line_The Burj Khalifa is incredible_line_Even if a the sight of really, really tall building doesn't sound that amazing to you, prepare to be stunned. The 829-metre Burj Khalifa (burjkhalifa.ae) is the tallest building in the world, and it really is difficult to take in just how stupendously big it is. The view from the observation deck, some 148 storeys above the ground, is mind-boggling. Nothing looks real from that height \u2013 it's like staring at a child's miniature of the world. Going to the top is not cheap (from $46), but it's worth every dirham._line_This is not a city for walking_line_An aerial view over Dubai's Palm Island, Dubai._line_Those who love to explore on foot will be sorely disappointed by Dubai. For starters, it's usually about a million degrees outside \u2013 you don't want to be trekking around in the sun. Plus most things in Dubai are miles apart, and the city has certainly not been designed with pedestrians in mind. About the only places you'll feel comfortable walking are the enormous shopping malls, which, in fairness, do provide plenty of room to stretch the legs._line_It's a shopper's paradise_line_Speaking of shopping malls, Dubai is a heaven on par with Hong Kong or Singapore for those who take pleasure in the purchasing of goods. You can buy just about anything here, from designer clothes to jewellery, spices, top-quality foodstuffs and souvenirs. At Dubai Mall (thedubaimall.com), there's even a "Gold to Go" ATM, at which you well-heeled shoppers can withdraw one-ounce bars of solid gold, provided they have the funds. Only in Dubai._line_A group of Emiratis walk past the Burj Dubai Tower, the tallest tower in the world._line_Dubai is not staggering merely in size and grandiosity alone \u2013 it's also a place of surprising architectural beauty. We're talking icons like the Burj Khalifa and the Burj Dubai (the sail-shaped luxury hotel), as well as the amazing Palm project featuring the Atlantis Hotel, the twisting Cayan Tower, and the JW Marriott Marquis, the world's tallest hotel._line_The desert is right there_line_It takes such a small amount of time \u2013 we're talking minutes here \u2013 to go from the skyscrapers and tarmac of Dubai to proper, endless desert. As soon as the city ends, the sand dunes begin. There are plenty of companies offering varying experiences out there in the wilderness, from 4WD safaris to Bedouin-style dinners to sand-boarding trips to quad-biking. It certainly makes a change from the shopping malls and fancy restaurants._line_Camel racing is big in Dubai._line_Given its proximity to the desert, it should come as little shock that Dubai gets hot \u2013 very, very hot. Average high temperatures in the summer months, June to August, range from 38 to 40 degrees. That's too hot to do anything outside except run to the next bit of air-conditioning. In winter, meanwhile, it's a mild 23 to 26 degrees during the day, making it ideal for wandering the streets or hitting the beach._line_The locals are rich \u2013 really, really rich_line_Your first brush with a local Emirati will probably be having your passport stamped at the airport. Your second brush with a local Emirati will probably be watching as one zooms past in a Range Rover or a Ferrari. Emirati tends to do quite well, financially \u2013 that much will certainly be clear if you ever find yourself driving past one of their extensive houses. Very few sit outside the 1 per cent._line_An Arabian Adventures four-wheel-drive does some "dune bashing" during a desert safari._line_There aren't many women around_line_This isn't a comment on culture, but on raw statistics. Dubai's population, thanks to a large influx of blue-collar migrant workers, is made up of about 69 per cent men. That means that by far the bulk of the people you'll see wandering around the place \u2013 unless you're in the foyer of your hotel \u2013 will be of the male persuasion._line_You can do pretty much anything_line_The view from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world._line_Feel like going skiing when it's 40 degrees outside? You can do that, at the indoor Ski Dubai (theplaymania.com). Feel like playing golf on a lush green course in the middle of the desert? You can do that as well, at several courses throughout the city. And if you feel like riding a camel, or going boating, or drinking French champagne, or seeing a concert, or going to an art gallery, or going stand-up paddle-boarding, or skydiving, or driving an F1 car, or swimming with dolphins, or going bungy-jumping\u2026 you can do that too._line_It's a place of high culture_line_Though the city might appear a little gaudy and gauche, there's plenty in Dubai for culture vultures. The recently opened Dubai Opera (dubaiopera.com) hosts regular concerts and events, while it's also possible to view contemporary Middle Eastern art at a number of galleries throughout town, or catch concerts by bands from around the world at places like Burj Park, The Music Hall, and The Music Room._line_Camel racing is insane_line_So much about one of Dubai's favourite sports is completely bonkers. For starters, there are no actual jockeys on these camels, but rather small robots that sit on top of the animals and are controlled by someone nearby. How is there someone constantly nearby, you ask? Easy \u2013 a flotilla of luxury, air-conditioned 4WDs follows the camels around while they're racing, allowing the passengers to control the robot. The camel-racing tracks are also so big that you'll barely be able to see the participants most of the time from your grandstand perch. But still, this is a proper experience._line_It's possible to travel on a budget_line_If you choose to stay in fancy resorts and eat out at the best restaurants and do your shopping in big malls, then a stay in Dubai will be very, very expensive. But it doesn't have to be that way. Spend time in the suburb of Deira, haggling at markets, eating Middle Eastern street food, staying in budget hotels and getting around on foot, and you'll suddenly find that this city can be extremely affordable._line_Everything seems like a world-record breaker_line_After a few days in Dubai you'll become so used to hearing that something is the biggest/fastest/most expensive/tallest/most beautiful in the world that those facts will cease to even register as being interesting. Dubai has many, many claims to world records for all sorts of things, including the world's tallest building and the world's largest shopping mall. Get used to hearing about it._line_It's not as conservative as you think_line_You've probably read the stories of foreigners being locked up in Dubai for public displays of affection, or being too drunk, or even being gay. And it's true, occasionally people do get caught out for activities that would be very much OK back home. But Dubai, on the whole, is not that conservative. You can wear whatever you feel comfortable in. You'll find expats and tourists from around the world drinking and canoodling in bars and clubs. And there's even a pretty healthy gay scene. Just be aware of cultural sensitivities, and you'll be fine._line_

VState-owned ONGC is likely to sell some of its stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC to part-fund it's over Rs 34,000-crore acquisition of refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) holds 13.77 per cent stake in India's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which at today's market price is worth over Rs 27,800 crore. It has another 4.87 per cent stake in GAIL India Ltd worth of Rs 1,600 crore._line_"The acquisition of 51.11 per cent government stake in HPCL will be funded through a combination of market borrowing and selling some stake in IOC and GAIL," a source privy to the development said. Selling stake in the open market may create volatility, and so, ONGC is considering selling less than 2 per cent stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC in the block deal, he added. 6 Precautions To Take When Investing In The Stock Market_line_ONGC May Sell IOC Stake To LIC In Block Deal_line_ONGC has already secured shareholder nod to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore debt, he said, adding that the company had about Rs 10,000 crore of cash in hand. "It will be a combination of stake sale and borrowing to fund the acquisition," the source said. The deal, he said, is likely to conclude by December. 6 Biggest Mistakes Stock Market Investors Makes_line_The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC "along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC." But since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension that it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders, he said. So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that "HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas". This helped avoid making an open offer._line_

V Thor 2: Alternate Malekith Design Revealed in Honor of Ragnarok _line_With only weeks to go until Chris Hemsworth once again wields the mighty Mjölnir in Thor: Ragnarok, fans are given a fresh look at the God of Thunder\u2019s previous outing and some original concept art for the villainous Malekith._line_Continuing the trend of the MCU\u2019s villain problem, Doctor Who alumni Christopher Eccleston stuck on the prosthetics to play Malekith the Accursed in 2013\u2019s Thor: The Dark World. While a different design may not have helped the movie\u2019s big bad stand out any further from the crowd, there is no denying that the Malekith that Disney settled on was certainly different from his comic book counterpart._line_Taking to Instagram, Marvel concept artist Andy Park is celebrating the arrival of Ragnarok and unveiled some of his original designs for the Dark Elf of Svartalfheim, to show comic book lovers what they could\u2019ve had in Alan Taylor\u2019s MCU film:_line_ #ThorRagnarok is about a month away! But let's take a look back at his previous cinematic adventure. I especially enjoyed exploring concept designs for Malekith. Here's one that was very similar to his comic book look. #malekith #thor #villian #darkelf #conceptart #costume #design #digitalart #illustration #\uadf8\ub9bc #\uadf8\ub9bc\uc2a4\ud0c0\uadf8\ub7a8 #marvel #marvelstudios_line_A post shared by Andy Park (@andyparkart) on Oct 4, 2017 at 8:54am PDT_line_\u2013_line_ Closeup of another Malekith concept design I painted up on #ThortheDarkWorld #thor #villian #conceptart #costume #design #digitalart #illustration #\uadf8\ub9bc #\uadf8\ub9bc\uc2a4\ud0c0\uadf8\ub7a8 #marvel #marvelstudios_line_A post shared by Andy Park (@andyparkart) on Oct 5, 2017 at 8:59am PDT_line_\u2013_line_In particular, note that the long-haired version of Malekith is much more in keeping with the supervillain that Walt Simonson first introduced in Thor #344 back in 1984. Looking like sort of demented Lucius Malfoy, this was the look that most comic book fans expected Eccleston to appear as in the Thor sequel. As for the second design, notice that Malekith has a much more technologically advanced look, and even bears an uncanny resemblance to other MCU villain Nebula. Ultimately, Taylor went with the masked version that audiences saw on their screens in The Dark World, and who knows whether a simple tweak to the look would\u2019ve made any difference at all._line_Thor: The Dark World, by most accounts, is the dark sheep of the MCU back catalogue. Plagued with problems from day one \u2013 including, the departure of Patty Jenkins as the film\u2019s original director \u2013 it is no surprise that The Dark World is the lowest-rated Marvel movie since the MCU kicked off with Iron Man in 2008. Among the biggest problems were a lackluster plot to release the Aether over the nine realms and many feeling that Eccleston\u2019s performance as Malekith didn\u2019t hit the spot. With too much of the story taking place on Earth, there was also that lamented final battle where Eccleston\u2019s forgettable bad guy was crushed by his own ship. Being one of the few MCU villains to meet their maker after the first outing, it isn\u2019t even like the character can be redeemed with another cinematic outing and an outfit change._line_Thankfully, it seems that lessons have been learned from The Dark World \u2013 and going for a garish neon tone and upping the fun factor for Ragnarok, hopes are high that Taika Waititi can strike the franchise with a bolt of box office lightning. As for Thor: Ragnarok\u2018s main villain, at least Waititi is sticking with a more comic book-accurate representation of Hela, Goddess of Death._line_ Key Release Dates _line_Thor: Ragnarok release date: Nov 3, 2017_line_Black Panther release date: Feb 16, 2018_line_The Avengers: Infinity War release date: May 4, 2018_line_Ant-Man & The Wasp release date: Jul 6, 2018_line_Captain Marvel release date: Mar 8, 2019_line_The Avengers 4 / Untitled Avengers Movie release date: May 3, 2019_line_Untitled Spider-Man: Homecoming Sequel release date: Jul 5, 2019_line_ TAGS: thor 2 _line_

The girl had been separated from her friend while travelling in Delhi Metro._line_The girl was found by CISF who sweep the station at night after the train services are terminated. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT PHOTO)_line_A 15-year-old girl, who got separated from her friend while travelling in the Delhi Metro, had to spend a night at a metro station as the Delhi Police could not take her custody because there was no woman constable. _line_A woman constable of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) turned saviour by feeding her dinner and keeping the girl under her watch on September 25 night at Pitampura Metro station. The incident took place when the train services had terminated. _line_\u201cWe conduct sweeping of stations after the train services are terminated. During the exercise, soon after midnight, the staff at Pitampura metro station saw a girl sitting alone at platform number 2. She was brought to the control room where she said that she was waiting for her male friend. We immediately called the police,\u201d said a CISF officer, who is not authorised to speak to the media._line_But the Delhi Police reportedly refused to take the custody as they did not have any woman officer at that time. According to rules, the presence of female staff is mandatory while taking the custody of a girl whether she is an accused or a victim. _line_\u201cThe Delhi Police requested us to keep the girl with a female constable of the CISF. We agreed and our constable was asked to sit in front of CCTV camera near the ladies frisking booth so that their movement can be monitored. In the morning, the girl was handed over to the police,\u201d CISF spokesperson Hemendra Singh said._line_ DCP (Metro) Pankaj Singh confirmed the incident and said that on that particular night, a female staff was not present at Rithala police station, under whose jurisdiction Pitampura Metro station is located. Singh said police took her custody the following morning and produced her before the Child Welfare Committee. The CWC\u2009sent her to a children\u2019s home till the next date of hearing.  _line_\u201cWe usually hand over the missing child to the family and if we are unable to find the family, we drop the child to the nearest shelter home,\u201d said a Delhi Police officer, who did not wish to be named. _line_With 28 lakh passengers travelling every day and 20% of them usually first timers, every day the CISF receives at least two cases of people getting separated from their relatives. While their main job is to secure the Metro premises, such cases are taken on priority basis as delay may affect the investigation. _line_Officer said that most of them get separated due to automatic doors and crowded Metro stations. Last year, over 100 kids were reunited with their parents. _line_ \u201cIn 2016, we reunited 106 children with their parents, while this year till June, 60 children have been reunited. Apart from this, over 100 adults have been reunited with their families from 2016 till date. We have trained our staff to identify people roaming alone. It is a misconception that only children are vulnerable. In Metro, many first timers from other states come and often get separated,\u201d the CISF official said. _line_

VOn Monday, a series of tweets by Jemele Hill got her suspended from ESPN again, with the network saying in a statement that she'd committed "a second violation of our social media guidelines." ESPN didn't say what exactly Hill had done to warrant the two-week suspension; however, Hill sent a series of tweets the week before denouncing Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who had recently threatened to bench players who didn't stand for the national anthem. Hill further suggesting that those who oppose Jones should boycott companies that advertise at Cowboys games. _line_"Jerry Jones also has created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones," Hill wrote after Jones issued the ultimatum. "If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts." Later, Hill wrote that "if you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers."_line_ESPN's Statement on Jemele Hill: pic.twitter.com/JkVoBVz7lv_line_\u2014 ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) October 9, 2017 _line_More to come..._line_

VSome mornings you really need makeup but don\u2019t have the time. Anyone who can manage to wear foundation with a perfect finish within minutes is most certainly worthy of worship. For those of us who lack the talents, there\u2019s always BB cream. In this article, I\u2019m going to review Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB cream._line_Also known as blemish base, beauty balm, blemish balm, and beblesh balm in different part of the world, BB cream helps give your skin subtle coverage and light moisturization. It\u2019s an essential product for anyone who is constantly on the go. The best part is that BB creams are usually quite budget-friendly. Keep reading to find out how Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream fared in this review._line_Maybelline Clear Glow Bright Benefit Cream Review_line_Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream is described as a \u201cbright benefit cream\u201d rather than a beauty balm. The product claims to give you superior and flawless coverage with its special mineral clay formula. This BB cream from Maybelline offers 12 hours of shine control while acting as a concealer and moisturizer. It also offers sun protection with an SPF 21 and PA++ formula. This product offers 8 amazing benefits. The all in one formula claims to leave you with a matte finish, protect your skin from harmful UV rays, and conceal blemishes, while brightening, smoothening, evening out, refining, and hydrating your skin._line_Shades_line_The Maybelline Clear Glow All In One Bright Benefit Cream comes in three shades \u2013 01 Nude, 02 Radiance, and 03 Natural, with 01 Nude being the darkest and 03 Natural being the lightest._line_Features_line_Hydrates and nourishes your skin_line_Offers sun protection_line_Suits all skin types_line_Dermatologically tested_line_Allergy-tested_line_Non-comedogenic_line_Does not irritate sensitive skin_line_Gives a matte finish_line_Sweat and sebum resistant for up to 5 hours_line_Evens out your skin tone_line_Smoothes your skin and makes it softer_line_Conceals blemishes_line_Keep reading to find out whether it comes through on these claims._line_Packaging_line_Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream is packaged in a plastic tube. The light teal tube-type packaging is small and holds 18 mL of product. The screw cap and narrow nozzle ensure that there is no spillage or wastage, making it extremely travel-friendly. Although hard to read, the packaging also mentions the full list of ingredients along with benefits and directions for use._line_Ingredients_line_The ingredients list is impossible to discern. However, yours truly managed to figure out what this product is packed with. This formula is free of parabens and contains a variant of vitamin C that helps brighten your skin. However, it contains Benzyl Alcohol and Titanium Dioxide which aren\u2019t ingredients I\u2019d look for in a product._line_AQUA/WATER, ETHYLHEXYL, PALMITATE, NIACINAMIDE, SILICA, OCTYLDODECANOL, TALC, OCTYLDODECYL, XYLOSIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, ISOHEXADECANE, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, ASCORBYL GLUCOSE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, DISODIUM EDTA, CITRIC ACID, POLYSORBATE 80, POTASSIUM SORBATE, PARFUM/FRAGRANCE, HEXYL CINNAMAL, BENZYL SALICYLATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, LINALOOL LIMONENE, MAY CONTAIN TITANIUM DIOXIDE, IRON OXIDES, AND CI 77499, CI 77482, CI 77481_line_My Experience And Review_line_I stumbled upon the Maybelline Clear Glow Bb Cream at the supermarket when my old product had run out. Having heard a lot of positive reviews, I made space for it in my cart (literally.) And I haven\u2019t had much use for my foundation and sunscreen since._line_Shades And Availability_line_The product comes in three shades \u2013 0 1 Nude, 02 Radiance, and 03 Natural. This is a bit disappointing as it only caters to consumers with light to slightly dusky skin tones. I decided to buy 01 Nude and 03 Natural because I had a hard time figuring out which one would suit me, and turns out there is not much of a difference in both the shades. While both of them work just fine for my face, I swatched them on my hand, which has a bit of a tan, and both shades left a white cast even thoughI had given it time to oxidize. The white cast that 01 Nude (on the left in the picture above) left behind was slightly less apparent than the one left behind by the latter (on the right.) For a product that is being marketed for an Indian consumer base, the unavailability of shades is a huge disappointment._line_Coverage_line_In the image above I swatched two Maybelline Clear Glow BB Cream Shades \u2013 01 Nude (Left) 03 Natural (Right). While the coverage is light, it is enough to even out your skin tone while masking redness and healing acne scars. Although the cream cannot fully replace foundation, it does make for an excellent base on the days when I choose to wear heavy makeup, and on the days when I go for the natural no-makeup look. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and makes my skin look smoother and evenly toned. As you can see in the image, while the shades aren\u2019t very far apart, 01 Nude is closer to my skin tone and blended beautifully._line_Texture_line_The cream feels extremely light on my face and spreads evenly regardless of whether I use a brush, sponge, or my fingers. It is neither too runny nor too thick, but has the perfect consistency for efficient blending._line_Fragrance_line_It has a subtle and pleasant fruity fragrance which has me swatching and sniffing all day. However, the fragrance fades quite quickly._line_Performance_line_Since I have light skin, I haven\u2019t had a problem with the white cast that these BB creams tend to leave behind on darker skin tones. The cream instantly brightens and mattifies my normal-combination skin, and controls oiliness at my T-zone. It also makes for a perfect base for my foundation, but on most days it provides more than enough coverage by itself. It subtly masks my healing acne scars and completely evens out redness, and brightens up my under eyes, giving my skin a flawless finish. I\u2019ve been using the product for about 3 weeks now, and it has still not run out._line_Pros_line_Comes through on all of its claims_line_Offers sun protection_line_Travel-friendly packaging_line_Non-comedogenic (doesn\u2019t clog your pores)_line_Instantly brightens your face_line_Controls oiliness to a certain extent_line_Gives you a matte finish_line_Does not cause breakouts_line_Covers minor blemishes_line_Easily available_line_Reduces the appearance of pores and fine lines_line_Cons_line_The unavailability of shades for people with darker skin tones_line_Small quantity_line_Not suitable for oily skin during summers_line_How To Use Maybelline Clear Glow BB Cream?_line_Squeeze a dime-sized amount of BB cream onto the back of your hand._line_Using your finger, apply five dots of the cream on your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin._line_Make sure that all the dots have an equal amount of the cream._line_Using your finger, a brush, or a sponge, gentle blend the cream into your skin._line_If there is any cream left at the back of your hand, use it to cover up any visible blemishes or dark circles._line_When working the cream at your under-eye area, gently pat instead of rubbing._line_Shelf Life_line_36 months from the date of manufacture._line_Price_line_18mL for Rs. 250/-_line_Rating_line_4/5- I would have given this cream a better rating if only there were more shades made available for Indian skin._line_Do I Recommend Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream?_line_I would recommend BB cream to women with light skin, and ones with combination, normal, or dry skin types. It is most suitable for people who do not have a lot of skin issues as it helps even out your skin tone by covering up redness, slight pigmentation, and light marks. However, it does not offer heavy coverage for people who might have excessive acne scars or pigmentation._line_If you are constantly on the go (and have light skin) this is the product for you. The only thing keeping me from saying that I love this product is the unavailability of shades. Have you ever used Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow Bright Benefit Cream?

Jio Payments Bank, which is a joint venture between Reliance Industries Limited and State Bank of India, will start its operations in December, Livemint reports._line_Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, wanted to launch Jio Payments Bank alongside the shipment of JioPhone, which he unveiled in July, the report said. But the RBI asked Jio Payments Bank to demonstrate its capabilities, and prove that it is fully compliant with the regulations before the launch, a factor which the report cited as the reason for the delay._line_With the Jio Payments Bank, both Reliance Jio and SBI are eyeing last-mile customers, according to the report. Reliance Jio's network reaches several rural areas. Its JioPhone is also marketed to enrich the lives of people living in small towns and villages. According to the report, Reliance Jio is at present shipping the handset in remote areas, and will subsequently bring it to the urban markets. A person cited in the report said payments bank is not the core focus of Reliance Jio._line_Airtel was the first company to roll out its payments bank in India. The Payments Bank is an audacious project from the Indian government to bring banking and financial services to much of the population in the country. First unveiled in 2014, a payments bank will allow customers to avail several banking features such as performing transactions from their smartphone and without ever going to a physical bank._line_Anyone with an Aadhaar ID can open an account with a payments bank. According to UIDAI website, more than 1.18 billion people in India have been assigned with an Aadhaar card. SBI has over 400 million customers, while Reliance Jio has more than 120 million subscribers._line_

VMumbai: After more than a year\u2019s silence on his row with Kangana Ranaut, Hrithik Roshan has decided to open up and clear the air surrounding the controversy._line_While the actor had communicated only through legal notices till now, he chose to break the norm with his first-ever social media post, followed by a TV interview._line_After his comments on an interview with Arnab Goswami on Saturday went viral, the actor also spoke to with CNN News 18\u2019s Bhupendra Chaubey on Sunday._line_During the interview, the actor revealed that despite being claiming that he's been harassed for four years, there was only one instance when he broke down._line_Popular dairy brand Amul is known for its interesting cartoons on various current topics, but the one on the Hrithik-Kangana row didn\u2019t go down well with the \u2018Kaabil\u2019 actor._line_He said, "The only time I actually had tears in my eyes was when I saw this huge Amul hoarding with my brand Krrish, which is something that is built by me, it is like my baby. And that brand was completely demolished on that visual. And it said something like Krrish being run out, being caught stealing some cheese or something. That was probably the only day when I felt that this is not right."_line_He further said, "I date it back to my first film Kaho Na Pyar Hai when the same Amul hoarding had me up and called me a phenomenon. And I just watched the entire journey and I said, 'You know, I have to find a way to detach from the hoarding that said I was a phenomenon and I have to find a way to detach from the Amul hoarding that is making me look like this disgusting creep. I really need to find what I think of myself as my identity. And I need to work on that. And I need to make it so strong that I can be bullet-proof against any perceptions from the outside world. That is a failing from all of us. We build our identity with what others say about us. That is how we have been brought up. Your parent tells you you are strong, you are strong. This was a fantastic lesson for me. Hard one, but to be walking into a party all by myself and still be able to contribute to people, make people laugh, spread positivity while they are looking at the hoardings and judging me."_line_Hrithik\u2019s friend, actor-director Farhan Akhtar wrote an open letter in support of him on gender discrimination when it comes to accusations made by a man against a woman as compared to a woman against a man._line_And Hrithik also reiterated it on the interview, he said, \u201cThe movie Pink inspired and affected me so much. But it also got me thinking, why 'No means No' only applies to a woman?\u201d_line_Hirthik got divorced from his ex-wife Sussanne in 2014, but the actor denies that his alleged affair with Kangana was the reason for it._line_He said, "Absolutely not. Sussanne has been very very vocal about this. She has been very vocal. And I feel like laughing at people. When people get divorced, it is not always because of infidelity by the man. That is just such a small-minded assumption. I am just trying to say that there are many reasons why people would like to live separate lives. Infidelity is just one of them. So the general assumption was, 'Ah he is the superstar, he must have done something wrong. She must have caught him.' That is not the case. We are great friends. It is between us. The reason that we decided to live separately may have been an inspiring reason, how do you know?\u201d_line_He also revealed that the controversy also affected his sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan._line_"I am being harassed as a father. I have kids going to school who may be teased and I am not okay with it."_line_He added, "People are saying that these two people are washing their laundry in the public. But it's not my laundry!"_line_With Kangana usually being very prompt in her responses, be it through legal notices or statements through her lawyer, another sensational claim from her side is very much on the anvil._line_

VThe No. 1 overall pick had a delayed start to his career, but it made Sunday not so bad despite another Browns loss._line_The Cleveland Browns were still unable to get their first win of the season on Sunday. The Jets handed the Browns a 17-14 loss that forced Hue Jackson to bench DeShone Kizer in favor of Kevin Hogan. At the very least \u2014 Myles Garrett was good._line_The Browns took Garrett with the No. 1 overall pick this past April, widely assumed to be the safest pick in quite some time. He missed the Browns\u2019 first four games because of a high-ankle sprain, but Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams said Friday that Garrett had a good week, and \u201ca really good look in his eye.\u201d_line_Sunday, Garrett had eyes for Josh McCown, who he sacked twice. The first one came on his very first snap as a pro._line_\u201cIt was just a great call by Gregg (Williams) sending me inside,\u201d Garrett said via Cleveland.com. \u201cHe jumps at me and I was just able to put a move on and make the play.\u201d His second sack came just after the two-minute warning._line_The sacks are great, but Browns fans have to love how Garrett has clearly embraced Cleveland and some of its other favorite athletes, like J.R. Smith._line_Garrett paid tribute to Smith with a celebration after the second sack, with one of his best celebrations after a shot ever \u2014 even if it did come when he was with the Knicks._line_Garrett lived up to his words prior to the draft, where he told ESPN the Magazine, \u201cIf you don\u2019t draft me No. 1, I will punish your team for the next 10 to 12 years.\u201d _line_He became the first top pick to register a sack in his first NFL game in 25 years. That\u2019s not even something the great Bruce Smith did._line_Myles Garrett is the first #1 overall pick with a sack in his first NFL game since Steve Emtman in 1992 pic.twitter.com/emNn8eLUPN_line_\u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) October 8, 2017 _line_Another impressive part of Garrett\u2019s afternoon, was that he was limited. \u201cWe had him on a pitch count,\u201d Hue Jackson said via Cleveland.com. \u201cI think that was important. His energy was outstanding.\u201d_line_Garrett didn\u2019t sound complacent after the game \u2014 he\u2019s ready for more. \u201cI always want more,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want to make more plays, have more effect on the outcome of the game, but as many as they give me I\u2019ll take and I\u2019m just going to try to do my best to make plays out there.\u201d_line_Outside of Garrett\u2019s performance on Sunday, the Browns have been quite bad this season. Going into Sunday, they were 26th in total offense while having scored just 63 points in four games leading up to Sunday._line_However, the Browns haven\u2019t been egregiously bad on defense. They\u2019re 16th in the NFL in total defense, and seventh in run defense \u2014 and that\u2019s been without Garrett._line_If Garrett can help the Browns improve off of those initial stats and help them get some wins, then the Browns might be bearable to watch. So far, the offense has been a mess, to say the least. DeShone Kizer hasn\u2019t been what the Browns needed \u2014 but he also isn\u2019t exactly equipped with the proper weapons._line_Corey Coleman has been injured since Week 2, leaving him with Ricardo Louis, Kenny Britt, and Rashard Higgins at wide receiver. The leading receiver on the team is Duke Johnson, a running back, with tight end Seth Devalve second in yards._line_The 0-5 start has been disappointing for the Browns. It appeared they made some good changes during the offseason, and improved the roster with picks like Garrett, Kizer, David Njoku, and Jabrill Peppers. Though it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still work to be done in Cleveland._line_If Garrett lives up to the type of player everybody expects him to be, he\u2019ll be the franchise player has desperately needed since coming back to the NFL in 1999. At the very least, he gives Browns fans hope for a better future, when there was none before._line_

V2018 Hyundai Creta facelift will have exterior updates and interior revisions; powertrain expected to remain the same_line_Hyundai Motor India Limited launched the Creta compact SUV in July 2015 as an immediate response to growing young customers opting towards buying big five-seaters instead of compact hatchbacks and sedans. While meeting the latest trend, Hyundai also enjoyed export benefits from Creta as the largest exporter of passenger cars in the country hit a dual-jackpot with large volumes of shipping to South Africa, Latin America, Australia, Asia Pacific, Middle East and some African markets._line_The success of Hyundai Creta can be related with the fact that it\u2019s currently the bestselling model in the Indian UV segment barring Maruti Vitara Brezza. As Brazilian market holds significance for products introduced by automakers in India due to the more or less similar road conditions, the Brazil-spec Creta gives major answers for an apparent facelift to us._line_Due to the recent anti-diesel vibe, Hyundai could follow the lines of Maruti Suzuki and introduce a similar mild-hybrid system that would boost fuel economy by up to 5 percent. While the tech could be employed in the facelifted Creta SUV in a similar fashion to the facelifted S-Cross, there are reports that mild-hybrid plans had already been axed by the brand due to the withdrawal of government benefits._line_Hyundai will most likely launch the facelifted Elite i20 early next year while the top-selling Grand i10 already received an update in early 2017. With the new-gen Verna making huge strides in the sales chart, the revised Creta will look to consolidate its position at the top of SUV charts in its segment. Here\u2019s everything you need to know the 2018 Creta from Indian market\u2019s perspective:_line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift India Launch_line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Launch_line_Second Half Of 2018_line_Hyundai showcased the facelifted Creta at the 2016 Sao Paulo Motor Show with styling updates and it has triggered a mid-life update for India. Although no concrete launch time-frame is known yet, the facelift will reportedly be launched in the later half of next year before an all-new generation tipped for 2021._line_In Brazil, the facelift is manufactured at Hyundai\u2019s Piracicaba facility in Sao Paulo on full-swing as required modifications were made to the production lines in July 2016 to make way for the new compact SUV._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Expected Price_line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Price_line_Rs. 9.5 lakh to Rs. 15 Lakh_line_Currently, the price for the entry-level 1.6 E Petrol starts from Rs. 9.29 lakh while it goes all the way up to Rs. 14.55 lakh (both prices ex-showroom, New Delhi) for the 1.6 Plus SX AT top-spec variant. Expect the facelift with visual updates to cost between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000 premium when compared to the existing prices._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Engine Specifications and Mileage_line_Enging_line_1.6L Petrol / 1.4L Diesel / 1.6L Diesel_line_Power_line_128 bhp / 89 bhp / 121 bhp_line_Torque_line_150 Nm / 224 Nm / 265 Nm_line_Transmission_line_Six-Speed MT or Six-Speed AT / Six-Speed MT / Six-Speed MT or Six-Speed AT_line_Initially offered in 10 different variants, the existing Hyundai Creta is powered by three engine choices. A 1.6-litre CRDi VGT diesel engine delivers 121 bhp and 265 Nm of torque and comes paired to a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission alongside a 1.4-litre CRDi diesel rated at 89 bhp and 224 Nm of torque._line_The sole petrol engine available is a 122 bhp producing 1.6-litre Dual VTVT engine linked to a six-speed manual transmission. It pumps out 154 Nm torque at 4,850 rpm. In the process of expanding the lineup, the Korean brand added an automatic transmission to the petrol engine in April before a special edition Anniversary model was introduced four months later last year._line_For the Brazilian market, it derives powertrain from the HB20 as the 1.6-litre CVVT flex-fuel engine should be good enough to develop a maximum power output of 128 bhp and 161 Nm of peak torque. The motor is connected with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. It competes against Honda HR-V, Nissan Juke and Renault Duster in Brazil._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Mileage_line_1.6L Petrol Mileage_line_17 kmpl_line_1.4L Diesel Mileage_line_22 kmpl_line_1.6L Diesel Mileage_line_20 kmpl for MT and 18 kmpl for AT_line_The ARAI efficiency figures of the 1.6 petrol, 1.4 diesel and 1.6 diesel MT and AT are 15.29 kmpl, 21.38 kmpl, 19.67 kmpl and 17.01 kmpl respectively. On the facelift, Hyundai will likely stick with the same engine lineup but they could be tweaked to deliver better fuel economy._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Dimensions_line_Length_line_4,270 mm_line_Width_line_1,780 mm_line_Height_line_1,627 mm_line_Wheelbase_line_2,590 mm_line_Bootspace_line_402 litres_line_Ground Clearance_line_190 mm_line_Fuel Tank Capacity_line_60 litres_line_The upcoming Hyundai Creta Facelift measures 4,270 mm in length, 1,780 mm in width, 1,627 mm in height and features a wheelbase of 2,590 mm and 402 litres of bootspace. The ground clearance stands at 190 mm while the fuel tank can hold a rated maximum of 60 litres. All these dimensions are as identical to the outgoing model._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Colours_line_The existing colour palette for the five-seat compact SUV contains Polar White, Phantom Black, Mystic Blue, Red Passion, Sleek Silver, Pearl Beige and Stardust options. More paint jobs could be added to make the facelift attractive further._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Exterior_line_The Creta is built on the same platform as the HB20 and will comprise similar assembly techniques and part sharing. The Creta, also known as Cantus in some markets, is a global version of the ix25 SUV. It willcome boasting different radiator grille with chrome surrounds and newly designed bumpers up front and rear as well as sleeker fog lamps._line_At the rear, the Creta is equipped with restyled tail lamp cluster with chrome strip running between the lamps and the bumper seems to have been applied with minor changes alongside new reflectors compared to the India-run model. The Brazil-spec Creta showcases identical design language as the current avatar with similar set of LED Daytime Running Lights and we can expect the same on the India-bound model._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Interior and Features_line_The interior of the existing Creta looks premium and upmarket. It features a multifunction steering wheel with mounted controls, stylish instrument cluster and a centre console housing a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system on the high level grades._line_The touchscreen infotainment system is flanked by dual AC vents on both sides which sport vertical slats and are positioned on either side of the dashboard as well. Expect minor updates to the seat upholstery and trims levels as the interior design is likely to be retained._line_Emphasising safety, now the Creta is offered with ABS and EBD as standard while mid variants get dual front airbags as side and curtain airbags, VSM (Vehicle Stability Management) and ESC (Electronic Stability Control) are limited to the top-end SX trim. More safety techs and equipment could adorn the facelifted model._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Key Rivals_line_The facelifted Creta will compete against Renault Duster, Nissan Terrano, Mahindra XUV500, Tata Hexa, Renault Captur and the likes._line_2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Images_line_ Source: Carplace and AutoHome_line_

VWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with beer getting smarter at the shelf (and the data that is responsibly collected) it\u2019s obviously not a good idea for businesses to take things too far. No one likes that \u201cclose talker\u201d at a cocktail party. They can be downright creepy._line_But avoiding the creep factor isn\u2019t easy, especially when powerful capabilities like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) are on the guest list \u2014 and usually depicted as creepy forces in the world of sci-fi (I\u2019m looking at you Blade Runner and Terminator)._line_ The reality is that A.I. and Machine Learning don\u2019t have to be creepy and they shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s what businesses do with their data that matters and how mutual value and trust is created with customers._line_Dealing with doomsday scenarios_line_So what to make of recent comments from Elon Musk who believes the \u201cglobal race for A.I. will most likely be the cause of World War III?\u201d Or the notion that Musk has embarked on a \u201cbillion dollar crusade to stop the A.I. apocalypse?\u201d No doubt about it, these are bleak, doomsday predictions of the highest order, coming from a modern-day visionary with access to bleeding-edge info, and they should be taken seriously._line_As for Machine Learning, well, it doesn\u2019t fare much better. Google\u2019s A.I. chief John Giannandrea recently said he isn\u2019t worried so much about Musk\u2019s war-mongering bots but he is very concerned about \u201cthe danger that may be lurking inside the machine-learning algorithms used to make millions of decisions every minute.\u201d_line_Yikes._line_Thankfully, other tech luminaries have a much sunnier disposition about A.I. and Machine Learning._line_Bill Gates recently told CNBC, \u201cA.I. will make our lives more productive and creative\u201d while Mark Zuckerberg believes A.I. is going to make our lives better in the future. As for the doomsday scenarios making headlines, Zuckerberg thinks they are \u201cpretty irresponsible.\u201d_line_Personalizing the shopping experience_line_Gates and Zuckerberg's thoughts are backed by serious research. IDC predicts cognitive/AI capabilities will figure in to some 40 percent of digital transformation initiatives by 2019._line_And at SAP\u2019s recent TechEd event, it was revealed that machine learning can help the $2.4 trillion fashion industry with a more personalized consumer experience, according to Margaret Laffan, Director of Business Development, Machine Learning at SAP._line_\u201cStatic window displays of the past won\u2019t work in today\u2019s world of fast fashion and consumer demands for an increasingly more personalized experience,\u201d said Laffan in a recent story, \u2018The Ultimate Personal Shopper Is A Machine.\u2019 \u201cMachine learning gives retailers the speed and intelligence to quickly match the hottest looks with every customer\u2019s fashion style.\u201d_line_As you can see from this video demo of what this level of personalization looks like, it becomes much easier to understand why A.I. and machine learning can improve people\u2019s lives without being creepy._line_

VPimples on our back and shoulders (a.k.a back acne) are a belligerent nightmare!_line_And while they might not be as visible as those pesky pimples that pop up on our face, they are definitely no less painful or discomforting. Plus, they seriously restrict our wardrobe choices._line_So if you have been fighting a fresh crop all over your back for quite some time now, then read on. Because in this article I am going to reveal how making 6 simple and healthy tweaks in your lifestyle can help you get rid of them fast._line_ Pimple Removal Treatment | \u092e\u0941\u0901\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0921\u093c \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u091f\u093e\u090f... by boldsky _line_#1 Don\u2019t Repeat Clothes_line_Back acne is more commonly seen during summers and humid seasons because we sweat a lot during these times. That means if you are an Indian, your back acne problem can very well last for months on end!_line_In such a case, the simplest way to get rid of back pimples fast is by following one rule: Never repeat your shirt/top._line_The reasoning behind this is simple. The sweat and dirt accumulated on your clothes are ripe grounds for bacterial growth. And repeating them simply exposes your skin to these dense microbial colonies, which leads to back acne._line_The rule applies to gym clothes as well._line_Note: If you do not have enough gym apparel, just remember to wash the sweaty ones under running water after every workout session to dislodge most of the sweat and dirt. They will dry up by the time you have to workout again._line_#2 Change Your Bed Sheet Once Every Week_line_Your bed sheet may look clean even after a few weeks, but it actually isn't._line_This is because your bedsheets absorb a lot of sweat and oil from your skin. Plus, the dust you see on your sheets are actually your dead skin cells._line_So if you are suffering from pimples on your back, make sure you change your bedsheets every week._line_#3 Clean Your Back_line_Do you clean your back every day when you take a bath?_line_If you are like most people, you probably don't. In fact, a lot of people are also known to skip soaping their legs daily (hint: men) since it requires more effort (read: bending over)._line_So if you are suffering from a bad case of back acne, it's time for you to buy a back-brush and start exfoliating your back with bath scrub or body wash._line_#4 Use Salicylic Acid Based Soaps and Body Washes_line_Dermatologists most commonly prescribe salicylic acid-based face washes and soaps for regular facial acne because this medicament is a potent anti-acne agent._line_So if you want to get rid of the pimples on your back, you can use the same every time you take a bath._line_#5 Shower After a Workout_line_While most of us shower without fail after every workout session, there are some who postpone it because of work commitments and inconvenience._line_Unfortunately, that's the quickest way to develop a bad batch of pimples on your back._line_So if you are guilty of skipping showers after gym, please make sure to leave at least 15 minutes in your schedule for a bath._line_#6 Wear Your Hair Up_line_Forehead acne is most commonly seen in those who leave their hair hanging over their forehead. Likewise, back acne is very commonly seen in those who have long hair._line_This is because hair carries a lot of dirt and natural oil in it. Therefore, whatever it touches ends up with a thin film of these substances._line_So if you have long hair and have back acne problems, the easiest way to get rid of them is by wearing your hair up in a ponytail or a bun._line_Was This Article Helpful?_line_At Boldsky, we strive to bring you the best health tips and home remedies so you don't have to visit the hospital unnecessarily._line_

VMUMBAI - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank's inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday._line_Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter._line_The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week._line_"Growth is always there in the MPC's scheme of things; we don't lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation," Patel was quoted as saying in the interview._line_"However, we have to be careful \u2014 we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth."_line_Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India's central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexbility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility._line_The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a "durable basis", Patel said._line_Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts._line_However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts._line_"Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent," he told Mint._line_"We have started seeing the upturn."_line_Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year._line_(Reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury)_line_

VThree-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton was part of the [+] [-] development team for the Project One concept._line_   development team for the Project One concept.  _line_At the Frankfurt Motor Show last month, Mercedes Benz put on one of the most extravagant and entertaining stage shows ever seen at an international automotive event. After a jazz-funk band warmed up the 3,000-plus audience, Broadway singers \u2013 yes, from New York City\u2019s Broadway! \u2013 appeared on stage using their substantial vocal ranges, unmistakable stage presence, and catchy tunes to introduce Mercedes\u2019 futuristic view of a greener world inhabited by clean hybrid and electric vehicles._line_The highlight of this remarkable ensemble happened when three-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton drove the Mercedes-AMG Project One hypercar concept on stage to a waiting Dieter Zetsche, Daimler\u2019s charismatic CEO. As Hamilton got out of the car, he said, \u201cthat was more nerve-wracking than driving the real F1 car.\u201d_line_Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of Daimler AG, and Lewis Hamilton [+] [-] present the new concept car Mercedes AMG Project One in Frankfurt. Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images_line_Now while there was some level of lip service in that comment, he was actually part of the development team of a supercar that borrows technology directly from F1. This car rewrites history. The Project One is a true watershed moment as it becomes the first ever road-legal car to employ a Formula 1 engine, a powerplant that will be built in the same factory, right next to the engine that powers Hamilton\u2019s F1 car._line_But for longevity and commercial viability, according to Mercedes at least, the Project One will get a down-tuned version of the F1\u2019s turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 hybrid generating upwards of 700 horsepower. The One gets another 500 hp from three electric motors, one on each front wheel, the third integrated into the engine. Total power is \u201cover 1100hp,\u201d says Mercedes. A fourth motor turns the turbocharger to ensure that you always have instant power. This engine will spin to 11,000 rpm which is down from the 15,000 max reached by the Petronas F1 car, enabling the car to reach speeds of 350 km/h._line_The Project One is unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. [+] [-] Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images_line_As one would expect in high-performance hypercars of tomorrow, the Project One also gets a precision 4WD setup with torque vectoring system that channels torque to any given wheel enabling greater grip and stability in corners. Mercedes tells us that it will make only 275 of these cars. But don\u2019t worry about checking your bank account because all 275 have already been sold._line_ So why does this $2.8 million car matter? Because as Mercedes calls it, \u201cProject One: Formula 1 technology for the road.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2013 the plan is to feedback some of this hypercar\u2019s technology to stock standard road-going cars for the masses. In addition to the safety systems like torque vectoring and impact absorbing lightweight materials \u2013 carbon fiber, aluminum etc \u2013 fitted to the car that will filter down to production cars, it is the technology employed in the compact, fuel efficient, high-performance engine that will be most desired by motorists._line_Imagine a 400hp E-Class propelled by a 1.2-liter hybrid that achieves over 50mpg. That\u2019s the kind of advancement the Project One promises in the very near future, according to Mercedes._line_

VLife on Earth may have started when meteorites splashed down into little warm ponds like this one in the Bumpass Hell trail in Lassen Volcanic National Park in California._line_ A new study bolsters the theory that the chemical origins of life on Earth were midwifed by meteorites that delivered essential building blocks from space._line_ Meteorites slamming into warm, small ponds on the planet's rising land surfaces more than 4 billion years ago could have delivered those building blocks into an environment where they could grow and combine into ribonucleic acid, or RNA, said Ben K.D. Pearce, an astrobiologist at Canada's McMaster University._line_ The study, produced by researchers at McMaster and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the latest in a debate over the origins of life. Did it come from Earth itself \u2014 forming around hot undersea vents in the crust \u2014 or from small ponds on land, as Darwin theorized, with material deposited from the cosmos around it? Pearce and his colleagues come down on the "warm little pond" side, arguing that the oceans were too harsh an environment for the building blocks of life._line_ RNA can reproduce itself and evolve. In its current form, it takes the genetic code contained in DNA and forms proteins._line_ "At one time, it was the dominant life form on Earth, and likely the first life form on Earth," Pearce told Seeker. But it's made up of a family of molecules known as nucleobases, which stem from a reactive type of nitrogen that wouldn't have formed on a lifeless early Earth._line_RELATED: Climate Change 5 Million Years Ago Coincided With More Mediterranean Volcanoes_line_ Nitrogen compounds like ammonia and hydrogen cyanide likely collected on bits of dust and rock floating around the sun, snowballing into larger bodies where they could react to produce nucleobases._line_ "You have get these molecules from space," he said. And when those space rocks fell to Earth, the nucleobases they held could have landed in ponds of water and reacted with other chemicals that produced RNA._line_ Previous studies have put forth that theory, but what Pearce and his colleagues have done is to use computer models to gauge how probable that would have been. Nucleotides would have to survive in an environment bombarded with ultraviolet light, since there was no protective ozone layer at the time, and in water that could have broken them up._line_ While other scientists, including the famous astronomer Carl Sagan, have theorized that cosmic dust may have delivered those precursors, Pearce said any nucleotides riding in on dust particles were likely to have been too small to survive in their new home._line_RELATED:Mass Extinctions on Earth Coincided With Out-of-Whack Carbon Cycles_line_ But by entering data "from all facets of science," including biology, geophysics, and astrophysics, they've calculated that meteorites would have been a frequent and durable enough vehicle to deliver the building blocks of life, and wet and dry cycles could have helped them bond into larger chains that formed RNA._line_ "There were thousands of opportunities for this to emerge from thousands of different pond environments," Pearce said._line_ Pearce said the next step will be to try to test that theory in a laboratory. Researchers at McMaster, located at the western end of Lake Ontario, are building a "planet simulator" in which they hope to reproduce the conditions of a primeval Earth and see whether they can get the same results._line_

VTwo "Emotion dolls" at the gender-neutral Egalia preschool in Sweden._line_ (CNN)From the moment a child is born, its gender pretty much determines how they will dress, which toys they'll be given and ultimately how they are meant to behave within society. _line_But some schools in Sweden are trying to strip away such gender norms. _line_There's nothing obviously out of the ordinary at Sweden's gender-neutral preschools at first glance._line_There are no designated areas to play with dolls or building blocks. The toys have been strategically jumbled to create an environment for girls and boys to play together._line_These two preschools in Sweden -- Nicolaigarden and Egalia (meaning 'equality' in Latin) -- go to great lengths to de-emphasize gender. Children are given the freedom to challenge and cross gender boundaries._line_Rather than encourage children to do particular things, the teachers are careful not to box children based on their gender or subtly discourage them from doing certain things._line_The school has removed the terms "girl" and "boy" completely. Instead they make a deliberate effort to call each child by their first name or the gender-neutral pronoun "hen"._line_But is it necessary to intervene at such a young age, and what are the long-term effects?_line_Removing the 'gender straitjacket'_line_A new global study found that young girls and boys are outfitted with "gender straitjackets" by the age of 10, resulting in lifelong negative consequences._line_The Global Early Adolescent Study analyzed how gender is learned, enforced and reinforced among early adolescents in 15 countries._line_It concluded that culturally-enforced gender stereotypes -- which are linked to an increased risk of mental and physical health problems -- are firmly rooted between the ages of 10 and 14. The study found these stereotypes leave girls at greater risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence, child marriage, and HIV. For boys, the risks can include substance abuse and suicide. _line_In Sweden, which is ranked as the fourth-most equal country in the world when it comes to gender, the government has made a concerted effort to emphasize equality in the Education Act._line_Following a new amendment introduced in 1998 requiring all schools to work against gender stereotyping, Lotta Rajalin set up her first gender-neutral preschool for one to five-year-olds in Stockholm's Old Town._line_The gender-neutral policies at Rajalin's schools ensure that stories, songs and dramatizations are screened or re-scripted to include non-nuclear families (single parents or same-sex couples) and heroines sweeping princes off their feet. _line_Teachers opt for non-traditional plot twists to ensure that they're not reinforcing gender stereotypes._line_How to be a gender-neutral teacher_line_Perhaps the most important distinction in these preschools is the way the teachers treat each child._line_To help identify any unconscious bias they have when dealing with girls and boys, the teachers filmed themselves interacting with children and took note of how they responded to the different sexes._line_"After we had been filming and observing each other, we understood that it's not the children we have to change, it's ourselves," Rajalin tells CNN._line_They discovered they used different tones of voice when talking to girls or boys, and tolerated rowdiness in boys while discouraging it in girls. Similarly, they found themselves to be more likely to comfort a crying girl, while they would tell a crying boy to brush it off. _line_"When you change yourself and your thinking and your expectations, you will see new things and you will see that it's better for children's development," she says._line_Rajalin believes gender stereotypes limit the opportunities available to a child. Her gender-neutral teaching methods stem from what she calls "the whole life spectra" or "circle of opportunity." This circle is often divided into two semi-circles -- one for boys and one for girls. _line_Through gender-neutral teaching, Rajalin hopes to open up this circle of opportunities for all children to define themselves._line_"We try to take away the barriers which stop both girls and boys doing what they want to do," she says._line_"We want all children to have the same opportunities to feel, to express themselves, to like what color they like, to play the sport they're in, and so on. We don't want to limit them."_line_Following a small, structured observation of children at one of Rajalin's preschools, Ben Kenward, a researcher in psychology at Uppsala University in Sweden and Oxford Brookes University in England, found these children had a reduced tendency to be influenced by gender stereotypes, compared to a control group of children from a typical Swedish preschool._line_"The [gender neutral] pedagogy is having some of the effects that it's intended to have, and if you're committed to giving these young children the same opportunities ... then our study suggests that this kind of pedagogy is a good tool."_line_'Brainwashing children'_line_However, these gender-neutral policies have generated much criticism over the years._line_Swedish psychiatrist and author David Eberhard considers calling boys and girls "hen" to be "intellectually dishonest" as it is being "blind to biological differences."_line_"This is the kind of brainwash that works when the kids are small and in the short run they adapt to this, but what happens when they go to normal school and they find out they were living in a sect?" he tells CNN._line_"This is a sort of a religious sect to say there's no differences between men and women, it has nothing to do with science."_line_Eberhard explained that he does not oppose boys choosing to play with dolls, but he draws the line at calling a girl or boy "it" or "hen"._line_Rajalin believes a lot of criticism is misguided, as people do not fully understand what they are trying to do. "We are not trying to say girls should be boys or boys should be girls, we just want every person to have the right to be the person they are, regardless of gender," she says._line_Harmless 'experiment'_line_While Eberhard's views are strong, he says gender-neutral schooling is unlikely to have any negative long-term effects on young children._line_"I suppose that they [the children] are so sure about their identity that it doesn't matter," he says. "But, as individuals, you may very well have young kids of different sexes that become very frustrated or confused."_line_He believes Sweden would be better off solving the problem of gender inequality in the real world._line_Rajalin, however, believes adopting gender-neutral methods and exposing children to teachers of various different ethnicities, religions, sexes and sexual orientations, will better prepare them for the nuances of the real world. It will boost their self-confidence and set them up to be more successful in life, she says._line_Psychology professor Philip Hwang from the University of Gothenburg is not convinced. He thinks Rajalin's gender-neutral preschools are harmless but overrated._line_"I don't really see any harm in it, but I think it pleases the parents more than it changes the children," he tells CNN._line_He says he has met a couple of parents that really believe sending their children to gender-neutral preschool will have lasting effects and that they will grow up in a gender-neutral society._line_"It's a statement more than something that has actual effect on children's long-term development with regard to gender issues," he says._line_"It takes generations to change norms and values like this."_line_Even Kenward, who is optimistic that the gender-neutral pedagogy is creating equal opportunities for children of both genders, is unsure what the long-term effects will be._line_"It's an open question what happens to these children when they move into primary school," he says. "My guess is it [gender neutral pedagogy] could continue to influence their behavior potentially, not in a very strong way necessarily. But it may have some lasting effects."_line_

V The Easy Danish Dough recipe is from my book, ._line_Easy Danish Dough_line_ Notes: The dough does need to rest overnight in the refrigerator, so plan accordingly. It\u2019s important for the Danish dough to come to room temperature before you roll it out, or the butter will not incorporate correctly. This dough can be frozen, but doesn\u2019t rise quite as nicely as when it\u2019s fresh. If the dough is not used right away after being out and turned, it will puff up in the refrigerator. This will make it a little harder to roll out, but you will still have good results._line_3/4 cup whole milk, warm (100-110F)_line_ 1 large egg, room temperature_line_ 2 large egg yolks, room temperature_line_ 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract_line_ 2 1/2 cups (355g) all-purpose flour_line_ 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast_line_ 2 tablespoons sugar_line_ 1 teaspoon salt_line_ 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick | 57g) Land O\u2019Lakes European Style butter, room temperature_line_ 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks | 170g) Land O\u2019Lakes European butter, cold, cut in 1/2-inch pieces_line_ Apple Jelly or Apple Butter_line_Cream Cheese Filling_line_ 6 ounces cream cheese, room temperature_line_ 1/4 cup sugar_line_ Pinch salt_line_ 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract_line_ 1/2-1 teaspoon lemon juice_line_Glaze_line_ 1 cup confectioner\u2019s sugar_line_ 2-4 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream_line_ 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract_line_ Pinch salt_line_ 1/4 \u2013 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice_line_ 1 tablespoon creme fraiche (optional)_line_For the easy Danish dough_line_ Grease a large bowl._line_In a large liquid measuring cup, combine the milk, egg, yolks, and vanilla._line_In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt on low. Add the room temperature butter and mix on low until it is incorporated into the flour and no pieces are visible. Add the cold butter and mix on low, until it is broken down and smashed a bit, but still in 1/2-inch pieces. Add the milk mixture and mix on low until combined. The dough will be very sticky and there will be visible lumps of butter. Using a spatula, scrape the dough into the prepared bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days._line_The next morning, transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Knead 10-12 times, until the dough forms a ball. Cover the top lightly with flour and cover with a tea towel, let rest until it comes to room temperature. Pat the dough into a 6-inch square and roll into a 16 by 20-inch rectangle. If the dough sticks at all, sprinkle more flour underneath it. Brush any excess flour off the dough, and, using a bench scraper, fold the short ends of the dough over the middle to made three layers, similar to a business letter. This is the first turn._line_Flip the dough over (seam side down) and roll into an 8 x 16-inch rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle, business letter style. Repeat the steps again, for a total of four turns._line_On the last turn, gently use the rolling pin to compress the layers together slightly. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour before using or keep refrigerated for 2 days._line_For the cream cheese filling_line_ In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the sugar, salt, vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and mix on low until completely combined. Taste the filling, and add a little more lemon juice if the flavor is dull. (The filling shouldn\u2019t taste like lemon, but a little bit of lemon juice will add a bright note to the filling. When tasting, look for a bit of a zing in your mouth that doesn\u2019t scream lemon.) Cover the filling and set aside until ready to use._line_For the glaze_line_ In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioner\u2019s sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, vanilla, and salt (if using the creme fraiche, add here, too). Add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin the icing to a preferred consistency. Add 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, and taste for brightness (add more if needed, but again, you don\u2019t want a lemon flavor here)._line_To assemble_line_ Cut the Danish dough in two equal pieces. Roll the first piece of dough into a 10 x 14-inch rectangle, using enough flour so the dough doesn\u2019t stick to the surface or the rolling pin. Transfer the piece of dough to a piece of parchment paper (this will make moving the braid much easier). Spread half of the cream cheese filling down the center of the dough, about 1 1/2 inches wide. Top the cream cheese with about 3/4 cup of the apple jelly. Carefully cut 1/2-inch thick strips of dough (a pastry cutter works best here), doing your best to make the strips even and equal on both sides. Starting with the top two pieces, gently twist then cross the pieces over the top of the filling. Continue the same motion of twisting the pieces and crossing them all the way down the braid. When you get to end of the braid, tuck the loose ends underneath the braid (this way they won\u2019t pop out when baking). Repeat with the second piece of dough._line_Move the braids (on the parchment) to baking sheets, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the braid rise until puffy (similar to a marshmallow when pressed), about 1 1/2 hours._line_Adjust an oven rack to the lower middle position. Preheat the oven to 350F. (I like to bake mine one at a time, but you could bake them together \u2013 adjust oven racks instead to upper and lower middle positions, then rotate sheets to opposite oven racks half way through baking._line_Lightly brush the braids with egg wash. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer the baking sheets to a wire rack and let cool slightly. Drizzle the braids with the glaze._line_

VDesigner Shilpa Tibrewala_line_ Chennai: _line_Now, the art teacher who has been living in Chennai for the past two decades, has finally come out with a boutique of her own in the city to nurture this interest. _line_\u201cMy advent into textile designing started with my art career. I have been interested in art since childhood and that later on expanded into an interest in weaves. I was teaching art a few years ago and the mothers of some of my students noticed the eye I had for picking good fabrics. They wanted me to pick out fabrics for them as well. _line_So, I started doing this as a home-based business for a while. Since both my father and grandfather were involved in the textile business, it was easier for me to find my footing. _line_At first there were just 40 people I was catering to. Then that became 80 and 180 and soon I had a good client base. This is how I decided to launch the present store, Artt n Attire. Our collection caters to the women who want to be simple and traditionally modern. It comprises handwoven sarees, suits, dupattas and lehengas curated, designed and handpicked from the corners of Varanasi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and the like,\u201d says Shilpa. _line_Shilpa adds that it is the giving back to the handloom industry that brings a lot of joy. \u201cWe provide skill training to many artisans who are involved in the handloom business in the hope that we can make them financially stronger and independent. _line_These are skills handed down for generations that had once put India on the map for the greatness of its textiles. We hope to revive that success,\u201d she explains._line_

VHello IMBBians,_line_I love sachet masks. Recently, I ran out of them and decided to pick up one and spotted the Rose Otto range and picked up some from them. Today\u2019s review is all about Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask. So read on to know more._line_Price and Quantity: $11.75 for 125 ml_line_ Product Description:_line_ Bioactive Organic Rose Otto Oil is a rich hydrating and moisturizing essential oil with renowned skin toning properties. We combine this fragrant wonder oil with a proprietary blend of bioactive, natural and organic ingredients including mineral rich Kaolin (China Clay). This nutrient rich clay based formulation helps to draw oil from the pores while ridding the skins surface of dead cells and impurities. It also helps to stimulate the circulation deep into the capillaries to leave the skin toned and purified._line_Directions:_line_ Use twice weekly as part of your cleansing regime. Apply the face mask evenly over whole face avoiding eyes and lips. Relax for 10 minutes and allow drying, and then removing with warm water or a damp flannel._line_ Ingredients:_line_ Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, Aqua, Kaolin, Calcium carbonate, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea butter), Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) butter, Glycerin, Zinc oxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hectorite, Glyceryl caprylate, Decyl glucoside, Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus (Sunflower) seed oil, Pelargonium graveolens (Geranium) oil, Eugenia caryophyllata (Clove) flower oil, Rosa damascena (Rose) flower oil, Parfum, Rosa damascena (Rose) flower extract, Passiflora incarnata extract, Tilia europaea flower extract, Calendula officinalis flower extract, Chamomilla recutita flower extract, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, Sodium phytate, Citric acid, Ascorbic acid, Geraniol, Linalool, Citronellol, Eugenol._line_My Experience with Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:_line_The mask comes in a cardboard package. There is all the information you need on the package. The mask comes in a white tube package with a white flip cap. The design is similar to the products from the Rose Otto range. The flip cap is not very tight and doesn\u2019t close with a click. But, it closes well and there is no leakage. The product is travel-friendly and the sleek package makes it easier to carry around in the bag._line_The mask gets dispensed very well from the tube. Since it contains clay, there are chances that it dries around the nozzle, so I usually clean up the area after usage. The mask is white, rich and creamy. It is white in color. The consistency is more like a cream than a mask. It smells delicious of roses and very similar to the other one available in the range. _line_You can use the mask with a hand or a brush, I prefer a brush for even and easy application. Let it dry while you relax for around 10-15 minutes and then wash off with water or a damp towel. Using water creates a mess and it is difficult to remove the dried mask, so I recommend using a damp towel and then wash off the remaining residue with water. _line_The product dries up pretty fast; however, it doesn\u2019t stretch the skin like the traditional Kaolin masks. After washing off, the skin feels very soft and smooth. The skin feels so supple. The mask does remove the dead skin and fills the skin with moisture. The mask is said to be hydrating, but I find it a bit drying and a moisturizer is a must to be followed up. _line_The product doesn\u2019t cause any breakouts nor does it irritate the skin. The product makes the skin cleansed and adds radiance to the skin. The product also dries out the pimples, which is great! The product does control oiliness on the skin. The product makes the skin toned. The product does rejuvenate the skin and makes the skin beautiful. _line_The product is free from paraben, SLS and artificial colors or preservatives. The mask is great but, it is a normal kaolin mask and I have used inexpensive ones from Balea that offers the same results, so I might not repurchase this again but till I have this, I would use it again and again. So summing up_line_Pros of Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:_line_Travel friendly._line_ Easy to use._line_ Thick, creamy consistency with amazing fragrance_line_ Doesn\u2019t irritate the skin._line_ Doesn\u2019t pull the skin when drying._line_ Skin feels very soft and supple._line_ Removes dead skin._line_ Controls oil and shine on the face._line_ Adds radiance._line_ Makes skin tones._line_ Dries the pimples and p[prevents breakouts._line_ Free from paraben, SLS and artificial colors or preservatives_line_Cons of Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:_line_Skin feels dry after use and a moisturizer is a must._line_ A normal kaolin mask and same effects can be achieved with inexpensive ones._line_IMBB Rating: 4/5_line_ Would I Repurchase/Recommend Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask? _line_ Yes to both! _line_ Overall rating:   0  out of 5 based on  0  reviews.  _line_

VThis is part of CNN Style's coverage on the "Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World." The exhibition will be shown at the Guggenheim Museum Oct. 6, 2017 to Jan. 7, 2018. _line_In 1997, conceptual artist Xu Zhen filmed himself smashing a dead cat repeatedly against a concrete floor. A year later, in a video called "Shouting," he let out a series of loud screams in Shanghai's streets and captured the crowds' bemusement as they turned to face the waiting camera._line_Xu, who was then in his early 20s, was building a career on hoaxes, pranks and shock value. But, two decades later, one of China's most talked about artists has come of age._line_ 1  /  11   \u2013  "Shouting" (1998) _line_"Shouting" is one of Xu's earlier works, where he let out screams in crowded public spaces and recorded people's reactions. Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen _line_The once censored provocateur is now the CEO of his own art company. More likely to exercise irony than provoke outrage, Xu has assumed the role of reformed upstart and mentor for a new generation of Chinese artists. "I think they're different," said the 40-year-old, from his Shanghai studio. "The youngest artists focus on matters of their own lives, like sex and human relations. A few years later, they will grow interested in social issues -- economy, business models, the Internet._line_"The artists we work with vary in age, born between 1985 to 1994. Society changes so fast so that, even in this 10-year period, there have been two or three (different) generations."_line_Becoming a brand_line_The fact that Xu can present himself as an elder statesman is testament to the speed at which China's art world is changing. (He says he's seen it pass through "four or five general phases" since the mid-1980s.) _line_But it also speaks to his ability to adapt to the times. The foundation of MadeIn Company in 2009 was a defining moment of this transition. It was a move that effectively ended Xu's solo career, transforming him from artist to brand, rebel to CEO. Xu describes it as his "art-creation" company. _line_Operating like Warhol's Factory, MadeIn's Shanghai exhibition space blurs the line between gallery and shop. It displays the work of up-and-coming talent (alongside Xu's own work), branded clothes, furniture and accessories. _line_ "Eternity Parthenon" (2014) Upside Buddha figures sit atop reproductions of Greek statues.    Credit:  Madein Company/Xu Zhen _line_Further out of the city, MadeIn's 54,000-square-foot headquarters boasts an exhibition hall and five separate workshops. "Some think there's a gap between art-lovers and non-art lovers," he said. "I'm interested in making art more accessible. Every piece of clothing, every meal you pick, everything is culture. I think (art) is not limited to painters (or) photographers. The momentum to create art is everywhere."_line_As well as creating art, the company undertakes research and publishing, with departments dedicated to media relations, planning, production and design. "We're not turning an art studio into a factory. We're turning an art studio into a brand," he said. "Under the brand, there are productions (and) various parts of the art industry. Why did I set up Madein Company to make art? Because in China, the form of a company has more freedom than individuals."_line_Market demands_line_Born in 1977, the year after Mao Zedong's death, Xu has regularly critiqued China's journey from collectivism to consumerism. In one of his best-known installations, "Supermarket" (2007), visitors were invited to shop at a convenience store stocked entirely with empty packages._line_But now, as CEO of MadeIn, the artist has both satirized and succumbed to the power of the market. It's a matter on which he is unapologetic. "I think all artists want their works to be sold, absolutely," he said. "The question is the precondition under which the works are sold._line_ "Xu Zhen Supermarket" (2016) The products inside the art installation are actually empty.    Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen _line_"It involves the questions: Are you willing to make an effort to cater to the market? What if the market happens to love your works or if the market won't love your works for another 20 years? Or what if no one loves your works?"_line_Yet, despite this very conscious commercialization, Xu has continued to push the envelope. In "Small Change" (2011-2014), he produced 20 tanks from Chinese bank notes, arranging Mao's face at the firing end of each gun._line_And in a move reminiscent of his former pranks, MadeIn presented work by a group of anonymous Middle Eastern artists, only to reveal that they had been invented by Xu as commentary on cultural prejudice. MadeIn's fixation with the internet adds further credence to its founder's description of his work as being "of the zeitgeist." _line_ MadeIn Company produced the "Physique of Consciousness" video in 2011. The company describes it as "the first cultural fitness exercise" -- combining exercise movements with spiritual and cultural rituals.    Credit:  Madein Company/Xu Zhen _line_From distorted digital porn ads to collages made from pictures found online, Xu can add a body of internet-inspired artwork to two decades worth of paintings, photographs, sculptures and videos._line_"The most impactful event for me, was the rise of the internet (in) around 2000," he said. "As a tool, it changes how we understand our lives to a large extent. It changes knowledge and the relationship among individuals. "It's a huge, brand new theme for art creators. Five thousand years of human civilization has solidified our understanding of our culture and our self-recognition. Those ideas are rearranged in the internet era; something new is dug up."_line_ "Rainbow" is a three-minute film where Xu's back turns red, beaten by an unseen assailant.    Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen _line_Yet, amid Xu's artistic evolution, it seems fitting that one of his earlier, more raw works will be on display at this month's "Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World" exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum. After all, it was "Rainbow" (1998), which depicts Xu's back slowly turning red as it is slapped by an unseen assailant, that introduced him to the world when it was screened at the Venice Biennale in 2001._line_"I think it's kind of brutal," he said. "It's very realistic and powerful." _line_Watch the video above for more of Xu Zhen's thoughts in his Shanghai-based studio. _line_Momo Moussa, Stephy Chung, Elliot deBruyn, CNN contributed to this report. _line_

VEveryone has their own go-to uniform, whether it be jeans and a white tee or an all-black outfit. And like us, Bella Hadid too has found an outfit she swears by: denim on denim. Unless you follow her style closely, you can't immediately tell this is her go-to choice, but after we combed through her street style snaps, we found more than enough proof the model loves this Spring trend. Despite its stigma for being hard to pull off, Bella's shown us you can wear the style from coast to coast and season to season. She's worn Canadian tuxedos in Spring (a denim jacket and mini skirt combo) and in Winter (jeans and a denim jacket). _line_Although this is Bella's safety-net outfit, there is nothing "safe" about the way she works her combos. She can take denim on denim to an edgy level (with chokers and fishnet tights) or tones it down with a bohemian twist and with distressed styles in lighter washes. That's the magic of this uniform: you can wear it multiple ways and it still looks fresh. Scroll on to see how Bella's mastered denim on denim and if you're in need of further outfit inspiration, our ultimate guide on how to wear the trend should do the trick._line_Bella Hadid wore a cropped denim jacket with her frayed GRLFRND denim skirt and Schutz heels. Image Source: Getty / SMXRF/Star Max_line_For Gigi's 22nd birthday, Bella turned to her go-to look of denim on denim. This time, she wore embroidered rose patterns on her Adam Selman jacket and jeans. Image Source: Getty / Gotham_line_Bella proved denim's versatility when she stepped out in this faded-black ensemble. She wore a fishnet body suit under her tee and matched her jacket to her jeans. The outfit had a touch of edginess thanks to her boots, choker, and matrix-style shades. Image Source: FameFlynet_line_Two words: Canadian tuxedo. Bella gave it a 2017 spin, however, with a black crop top and chokers. Everything about her outfit, from the over-size jacket to the flared pants, screamed casual and cool. Image Source: Getty / Alo Ceballos_line_The back of her denim jacket even held a surprise, featuring graphics and quotes. Image Source: Getty / Alo Ceballos_line_Denim jackets and jeans are an easy combo, but Bella took it up a notch with this denim mini skirt. She kept it sexy underneath with a sheer shirt that showed off her bralette. Image Source: Getty / Marc Piasecki_line_The model's been wearing denim on denim since last year, proving this outfit is her go to every time. For the warm weather, Bella ditched the darker colors and opted for a light, distressed mini to go with her cropped denim jacket. The squeaky-clean white booties gave her look a Summertime feel. Image Source: Getty / NCP/Star Max_line_When your denim jacket collection includes all fits and colors, it's easy to pull together a denim-on-denim look. Bella invested in a washed-out black piece to go with her GRLFRND mini. Instead of ankle boots this time, the model wore over-the-knee boots for a sexy and sassy vibe. Image Source: Getty / Marc Piasecki_line_White lace-up jeans might not be your pick of choice, but when paired with a light blue denim trench you have to admit the outfit is worth a try. Bella's got the right idea on mixing two different colored denims together. Image Source: Getty / Michael Stewart_line_

The actors are very enthusiastic as the play is to be staged at Tagore Hall - the hub of cultural activities. _line_Even as festivals and events related to theatre have become common at the Tagore Hall now, artistes say a lot still needs to be done to fully revive the lost glory of theatre in the Valley that had taken a hit after the eruption of militancy over 27 years ago. _line_\u201cBefore 1989, there were so many groups here and theatre activities were at their peak. However, these suddenly came to a standstill. Theatre is now reviving to some extent but the government and corporate houses need to come forward in a big way to promote the culture,\u201d said veteran theatre artiste Farooq Sheikh. _line_He said they still had to knock at the doors of people for sponsorship and taking up theatre as a profession in the Valley was unthinkable. _line_\u201cProduction costs are high and we have to knock on people\u2019s doors for sponsorship. Whosoever is involved in theatre presently is only so because of his love for this art,\u201d he said. _line_Another well-known theatre/television actor Hassan Javaid echoed similar views. \u201cI have given my life to theatre but I always tell youngsters to keep other options ready as well. One cannot solely survive on theatre in Kashmir even though we are glad that Tagore Hall of late has hosted several theatre-related events where youngsters are getting a chance to showcase their talent,\u201d he said. _line_Despite nil monetary gain, youngsters are taking to theatre in a big way. Rayees Wathori (23), who had done a brief role in Salman Khan-starrer Bollywood movie \u2018Bajrangi Bhaijaan\u2019, is on job to revive \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019 \u2013 Kashmir valley\u2019s own folk theatre that is on the verge of extinction. _line_\u201cWe, a group of 15 youth from Budgam (in central Kashmir), have formed a group to revive \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019. There is no monetary gain but we hold \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019 shows only to keep our culture alive,\u201d he said. _line_Wathori, too, said the government needed to come forward in a big way so that theatre activities flourished in the Valley. _line_

VPadmavati Trailer: Ranveer Singh Outshines Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor in the first promo_line_Shirtless pictures of Bollywood studs that are hot AF_line_The long wait to see Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer\u2019s Padmavati trailer has finally come to an end. This morning the makers announced that the trailer of the film will be out at 13:03 pm and as expected it is out and it has left us speechless thanks to the grandeur and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s vision. The trailer was released at this time because it has a historical significance. It was in 1303 AD that Rawal Ratan Singh first fought with Alauddin Khilji, that is why the makers decided to digitally release the trailer at this time._line_The filmmaker surprised everyone as he unveiled the look of the three lead characters of his film. Deepika\u2019s look as Rani Padmini redefined royalty while Shahid Kapoor\u2019s Maharawal Ratan Singh look was impressive. But it was Ranveer Singh\u2019s menacing Sultan Alauddin Khilji avatar that we loved the most. The actor was unrecognisable in his new avatar. His long tresses, his kohl eyes and the scar, everything about his look was just too good. The actor will be seen in a negative role in the film for the very first time.

V Fintech firm Qbera on Monday announced its partnership with Droom to provide easy financing options for purchasing pre-owned cars, bikes or new cars from the online automobile marketplace._line_Aspiring automobile owners can now choose from more than 50 lakh options on Droom, which include cars, bikes, scooters, and super cars and finance their dream vehicle with unsecured personal loans from Qbera. Also, With the help of a driven team of experts and cutting-edge innovation, the platform approves and disburses personal loans of up to Rs. 7.5 lakh in as little as 24 hours._line_"Traditional lenders have exhaustive and strict criteria when it comes to funding auto loans for pre-owned vehicles. Due to long and time-consuming verification procedures, borrowers have to undergo arduous waiting periods before they receive the funds in their bank accounts. Moreover, traditional financial institutes offer loans at interest rates which start from 14 percent and can go as high as 20 percent. Qbera, on the other hand, follows a risk-based approval procedure and offers borrowers instant loans at the same rate in the shortest span of time. Hence, instead of seeking second-hand car loans, it would be a wiser option to apply for a personal loan on our platform," said Aditya Kumar founder and CEO, Qbera._line_"Getting auto loans for used vehicles in India is full of pain points, simply because it takes forever. High rejection rates, lots of paperwork and unaffordable credit terms make it difficult for consumers seeking loans for used vehicles. Through our partnership with Qbera, we are offering a new-age auto financing option to make the loan disbursal process smoother, more affordable, efficient, and paperless. Hence, we are confident that this collaboration will prove to be a win-win situation for both companies and consumers," added Sandeep Aggarwal founder and CEO, Droom._line_India's automobile industry displays humungous potential and is currently the third largest market in the world. The pre-owned car market in the country, with approximate annual sales of 3.6 million cars, is growing at an exponential rate of 20-25 percent and is expected to grow to 4x of its current value by 2020. Currently, a majority of automobile deals by millennials in India are conducted online._line_Traditional lenders are often reluctant to finance pre-owned cars due to the faster rate of depreciation, thus offering a sizeable market opportunity for digital lending platforms like Qbera in this segment._line_The platform assesses borrowers based on a wide range of non-traditional criteria in addition to traditional information such as their income, credit score, social score, and FOIR/DTI to ensure that they have the capacity to repay the loans.

VRetail brands are using hotels to market products. Does it work?_line_You might not immediately think of a hotel as the most likely way to sell products, but retailers are excited about the possibilities of this unconventional, intriguing approach._line_But there are four methods retailers are using to get people who stay over to become more familiar with products. _line_1. Making It Easier for Guests to Experience--Then Buy--Products_line_Many people balk at buying items for their homes because it's hard to envision whether the products they see on the shelves will be as fantastic during real-life use._line_That's probably why Restoration Hardware has been hard at work planning a 14-room hotel with a proposed rooftop deck and swimming pools._line_The company recently received planning permission for the property, which is located in a historic building within Manhattan's Meatpacking District._line_Restoration Hardware already has a section of its website devoted to hotel bedding, and it's filled with luxurious Italian linens. Going to a Restoration Hardware retail location and feeling the sheets is one thing, but sleeping on them for a few nights leaves no doubts about how great they feel._line_While staying in this planned hotel, guests could find furniture and other home accessories in their rooms that they can't wait to own. Then, thanks to a nearby Restoration Hardware retail location, they can quickly go and purchase items to enhance their abodes._line_2. Giving a Platform to Emerging Artists_line_It's not uncommon for hotels to fill lobbies and rooms with artwork from local painters or photographers._line_However, the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin is taking that concept to a new level. Since it opened in the late 19th century, the hotel has been known for Victorian art and now has a permanent, 80-piece collection._line_It also boasts a forward-thinking artist-in-residence program that showcases the work of an artist and even allows guests to get customized pieces on the spot. Every year, the hotel welcomes a new creator who sets up his or her studio in the lobby._line_Currently, the lucky person is Margaret Muza. She offers tintype photography, a process that's even older than film. For $150, hotel guests can get self-portraits that Muza makes in about 15 minutes._line_This marketing plan is admirable for various reasons. It gives exposure to artists who otherwise may remain largely unknown to people outside the art world, and it's also a way for travelers to buy unique souvenirs from their stays._line_Plus, since the Pfister Hotel already has a background in art, this program strengthens that facet of the brand even more. _line_3. Helping Guests Recreate One of the Best Parts of Their Hotel Experiences at Home_line_Many upscale hotel brands are enabling guests to focus on the importance of sleep by offering extravagant extras like in-room massages and foods to help them drift off to dreamland. These amenities allow properties to charge significantly higher rates for rooms with specialized beds and other sleep-related perks._line_Some hoteliers have even started selling the beds used in the rooms so guests can get the same restful nights of sleep they enjoy at a luxurious hotel throughout the rest of the year._line_The Four Seasons hotel chain is one example of a brand that's taking this approach. It has partnered with Simmons to offer exclusive mattresses complete with toppers and opulent sheets._line_4. Promoting an Active Lifestyle for Guests on the Go_line_Many health-conscious travelers moan about having to disrupt their gym regimens when they're away from home. However, because well-known fitness brand Equinox has recently branched out into the hospitality industry, customers can soon enjoy top-notch hotel experiences that keep them fit._line_Equinox plans to open its first hotel in Manhattan's Hudson Yards district by 2019 with another one getting established in Chicago afterward._line_According to Equinox marketing executive Carlos Becil, the market is ripe for a smooth pairing of a fitness brand and place to stay. He notes that 95% of people polled said they would like to book rooms in an Equinox branded property. Consider that those people were already familiar with Equinox and knew what the brand entails._line_However, Equinox is expanding its gym locations, and hotels could add momentum to that process._line_Anyone can stay at the Equinox hotels, but people who go to the brand's fitness centers and are members there get special privileges. If non-members are particularly impressed by the quality and amenities offered within their hotel stays, they could realize there is no better time to make good on the promises to start working out more often._line_These case studies prove that using hotels as product-selling platforms is a smart idea indeed. People already crave immersive accommodation options that let them escape everyday routines for a while. This kind of branding is an intelligent extension of that reality._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_

He's hitting the ball in the nets, he's up and about in the field," Finch said in full support of Maxwell._line_It would also be interesting to see how Finch tackles Yadav this time.

VEvery single line item in our entire Bernie Madoff scam of a system is cooked._line_My theme this week is The Great Unraveling, by which I mean the unraveling of our social-political-economic system of hierarchical, centralized power. Let's start by looking at how the basis of governance has transmogrified from consent of the governed to consent of the conned._line_In effect, our leadership leads by lying. As we know, when it gets serious, you have to lie to preserve the perquisites and power of those atop the wealth-power pyramid, and well, it's serious all the time now, so lies are the default setting of the entire status quo._line_But all too many of us are willing to accept the lies because they're what we want to hear._line_As any competent con-man knows, you can only con those who want to be conned. You can only scam the marks who want to believe that what's obviously too good to be true is in fact true._line_The story of scams such as Bernie Madoff's isn't that canny Bernie victimized helpless wealthy people; the untold story is that all those "victims" wanted to believe that something that was obviously too good to be true--incredibly high returns, logged month after month and year after year like clockwork--was in fact true because their greed made them more than just vulnerable to being scammed--they wanted to be bamboozled by Bernie._line_Victims of scams naturally deny their own culpability. It's extremely uncomfortable to admit that greed didn't just blind us to a patently impossible yield; we wanted to be conned because it felt so wonderful to believe we richly deserved unearned wealth._line_All wealth is "earned" to those doing the skimming. The greatest con machine of all time, Wall Street, judiciously refers to every skim and scam as "earnings."_line_And so the "victims" blame our lying leaders for telling them what they want to hear. You see how the webs of self-interest reinforce each other: those atop the wealth-power pyramid secure their position by lying persuasively enough to gain The Consent of the Conned--those who give their consent to a visibly corrupt and unsustainable status quo because that status quo is promising to provide too good to be true goodies._line_In other words, the lies are constantly compounding: the leadership lies to themselves-- we have to lie to keep everything glued together for the good of the people--when their real motivation is to keep the system glued together because the system gives them wealth and power._line_If we can be honest for a moment, we might admit that representational democracy encourages leaders to issue too good to be true promises because those promises win votes._line_Those on the bottom of the wealth-power pyramid accept the too good to be true assurances because that's exactly want we want to hear: that we all deserve a piece of the unearned wealth that, like Bernie Madoff's painfully impossible scam, flows in permanent abundance via some sort of financial magic._line_The books are cooked, people; we embrace a gigantic too good to be true Bernie Madoff scam of a system because it's what we want to believe and what we want to hear. Then, when the whole phantom-wealth con collapses in a heap, we quickly pull on the tattered cloak of victimhood: we were promised, we were lied to, we trusted our leaders to lead us wisely, and so on, as if the con wasn't obvious to anyone who was skeptical of too good to be true claims._line_Now that the whole Bernie Madoff scam of a system is unraveling, two self-reinforcing dynamics are in play: our leadership, elected and unelected alike, are doubling down on the lies because there is no alternative--TINA. What does a liar gain by confessing the whole prosperity thing is illusory, and darn it, we can only spend what we produce in real-world surplus? Short answer: nothing, because that's not going to win elections or gain the consent of the governed._line_So lies are piled on lies to the point of absurdity. But just as Bernie Madoff's wealthy marks ignored the warnings of the skeptical and mounting evidence that they were being conned, the electorate wants to believe the magical thinking is real, and so they accept the latest statistical flim-flammery as "proof" that the con is not a con._line_Once again, we worship the Goddess TINA--there is no alternative. Just as our leaders are now trapped in their web of lies and false assurances, the governed are also trapped in the con because it's too painful and unnerving to admit we've willingly bought into a complete con: we're too smart to be conned, we protest; look, it's not a con, the GDP is growing and unemployment is low--and so on._line_Bernie Madoff's marks made the same defensive protests: it can't be a con, look at my statement: the monthly "earnings" keep pouring in._line_The books are cooked, folks, at every level of our Bernie Madoff scam of a system: the federal books are cooked; state, county and city books are cooked; corporate books are cooked; the statistical metrics are all cooked; the projections are cooked, and the estimates are cooked._line_Every single line item in our entire Bernie Madoff scam of a system is cooked. Wanting to believe a con is true doesn't make it true. The power of a con rests in our great desire to believe that what's too good to be true is magically true. It isn't, but it feel so reassuring and, well, deserved for it to be true._line_It's tempting to blame our leadership for perpetrating this systemic con, but every con requires marks who are willing to accept that what's too good to be true is magically true._line_* * *_line_

VGuest post by Paul A. Miller_line_As a folk historian and facilitator with Legacy Chronicles Life Stories, it should come as no surprise that I believe in the value of securing and sharing these precious memories of our loved ones._line_I am convinced family storytelling can bring together generations, restoring and strengthening relationships while educating each of us about our own backgrounds. Family stories help us understand where we come from and who we are._line_But can family storytelling also improve mental health?_line_I\u2019m not a mental health expert; nevertheless, from my experience, I believe so. Here are four ways sharing family stories can promote a healthy mind in both the teller and the listener._line_Identity_line_Identity has become a buzzword in America\u2019s political battlegrounds, but this concept is basic to a person\u2019s mental health._line_We grow and maintain healthy relationships with others when reaching out from a place of understanding who we are as individuals._line_Storytelling fosters construction of identity in two ways. For the storyteller, expressing those memories affords an opportunity to create a unique style and character. The stories themselves often portray the teller as the protagonist, and the teller narrates his or her own drama which re-enforces specific aspects of that identity._line_The listeners learn and engage with parts of their familial background, providing additional material to be used in constructing their own identities. I personally found this to be the case when my father told me the story of his childhood. Though a third-generation American, as a child his family spoke German almost exclusively. For me, an appreciation for the challenges of immigrant families and non-English speakers is more than a policy choice or a moral imperative, it is part of the background of who I am. It is part of my self-identity._line_Direction_line_As each of us looks back over our experiences, we inevitably see commonalities. We connect the dots. We formulate a vector for our life._line_One gentleman I recorded had overcome two major challenges in life: addiction and a debilitating accident which cost him two limbs. In his storytelling, these major events, either of which he could have blamed for derailing hope for a happy life, instead became segments of highway on a road which is leading somewhere. They give him direction and point to a purpose which he now actively pursues._line_An audience can also find direction in the example of the storyteller. Life can seem a little random sometimes \u2013 at least mine can! Experiencing the wisdom of our loved ones through stories can open up new ways to interpret our complicated lives, ways which may point toward opportunities we had not considered. We feel peace with purpose, and our mental outlook improves._line_Community_line_Among the great tragedies of our day is the pervasive loneliness in society. Although our technology connects us in ways never dreamed of even 50 years ago, that same technology separates us from human contact._line_I may learn of the activities of a friend on the West Coast in great detail, but I can\u2019t shake his hand or look him in the eye. I may tweet back and forth with my cousin, but we still don\u2019t actually meet and talk. The human element is fading from our communications, and with it, our sense of mutuality and relationship._line_When close friends or family members come together, they inevitably tell stories \u2013 stories about their work, their pastimes, their activities, their friends, their challenges. They draw a portrait of who they are in their story selection, in their speaking style and in the details they provide. The teller receives the gift of self-expression, which affirms individual value even as it includes the teller in a wider community with the audience._line_The listeners receive a gift as well: understanding. Even when the story is challenging or boring \u2013 even when it makes no sense \u2013 the story is educating the audience about this person whom they care about, uniting them as humans. They may be of different opinions and outlooks, but teller and audience are united as a community in the storytelling setting._line_In a recording session I held recently, two siblings remembered a story in substantially different fashion. They contradicted each other on several points, argued a bit about who was right \u2013 then allowed each other to finish the story in their own way. United as tellers and audience, they felt an obligation to mutual respect in the presentation and reception of the story, told separately. In the end, they laughed together over faulty memories! The sense of community was maintained._line_Shared Stories, Healthy Minds_line_We are social animals. Our relationships largely define how we look at ourselves and how we react to the challenges of life._line_We are storytellers. The anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson has said, \u201cThe human species thinks through metaphors and learns through stories.\u201d We use stories to pass on vital information, not only on facts and figures but in concepts, in art, in ethics, and in truth._line_We are an audience. We cannot help but listen in on a good story. We spend billions of dollars entertaining ourselves with stories in movies, television programs, plays, and books._line_My grandfather lived a large and exciting life. Farmer, brewer, policeman, restaurateur, liquor control agent \u2013 he did it all. He traded in Cadillacs, snowmobiles, and horses. He nearly blew up his garage more than once. He was a fireworks-shooting, cigar-smoking fisherman extraordinaire._line_And while people often remember his various careers, his trading ventures or his highly-colorful language, what they generally recall most are his stories. People still smile and laugh when they hear I am Woody Tuohy\u2019s grandson. To put it simply, his stories brought people joy, and he enjoyed telling them._line_Immerse yourself in the stories of your loved ones. Tell a few stories yourself. Include the younger members of your family in this celebration of our humanity. It can\u2019t help but improve your outlook on life._line_

VExecutive Summary_line_Scientific studies have long suggested that investing in the right people will maximize organizations\u2019 returns. In a world of unlimited resources, organizations would surely invest in everyone.In the real world, however, limited budgets force organizations to be much more selective, which explains the growing interest in high potential (HiPo) identification. If we are going to invest in the right employees, how do we find them? What are the key indicators that signal star potential? Research points to three general markers of high potential: 1.) ability (Is the individual able to do the job in question?); 2.) social skills (Can this person establish and maintain cooperative working relationships); and 3.) drive (is this person motivated to work hard, achieve, and do whatever it takes to get the job done?). Most organizations could probably upgrade their talent identification processes if they keep things simple and focus on these three generic markers of potential. Investing in these individuals will produce the highest ROI for your company._line_How inclusive or exclusive should organizations be when developing their employees\u2019 talents? In a world of unlimited resources, organizations would surely invest in everyone. After all, as Henry Ford is credited as saying, \u201cthe only thing worse than training your employees and having them leave is not training them and having them stay.\u201d In the real world, however, limited budgets force organizations to be much more selective, which explains the growing interest in high potential (HiPo) identification. An employee\u2019s potential sets the upper limits of his or her development range \u2014 the more potential they have, the quicker and cheaper it is to develop them._line_Scientific studies have long suggested that investing in the right people will maximize organizations\u2019 returns. In line with Pareto\u2019s principle, these studies show that across a wide range of tasks, industries, and organizations, a small proportion of the workforce tends to drive a large proportion of organizational results, such that:_line_the top 1% accounts for 10% of organizational output_line_the top 5% accounts for 25%, of organizational output_line_the top 20% accounts for 80% of organizational output_line_Careful research over many jobs and across many organizations in multiple industries highlights a clear pattern: the payoff from employing top talent \u2014 defined as the vital few who account for the biggest chunk of organizational output \u2014 increases as a function of job complexity. For less complex jobs, like manufacturing, top employees outperform average employees by a median margin of about 50%. However, for medium complexity jobs, such as trainers or first line sales managers, that difference grows to 85-100%, and for highly complex jobs, such as senior leadership roles, the contribution of top performers is more than double that of the average performer._line_It is also noteworthy that talented employees are \u201cforce multipliers\u201d, raising the performance bar for their colleagues, and particularly for their direct reports. By word and deed, they model and teach winning behaviors that shape high-performing cultures. Simply adding a star performer to a team boosts the effectiveness of other team members by 5-15%. No wonder, then, that study after study shows stronger financial performance in companies that make proportionally greater investments in identifying and developing top talent._line_If we are going to invest in the right employees, the key question concerns who they actually are. This begs the question of what highly talented people are like. In other words, what are the key indicators that signal star potential?_line_As academic reviews noted, the first and most important decision that needs to be made in this regard is to decide \u201cpotential for what?\u201d Unfortunately, most HiPo interventions focus on individual career success \u2014 \u201cpotential to move up two roles in five years\u201d is a common definition \u2014 but the ability to advance one\u2019s own career does not guarantee that one will make a crucial contribution to the organization. In fact, most organizational leaders \u2014 and it would be hard to argue that these people have not attained individual success, since they got to the top \u2014 don\u2019t have a positive impact on their teams and organizations, with estimates suggesting that at least 1 in 2 leaders cannot engage employees and fail to turn their teams or organizations into high performing machines. Indeed, there is no shortage of leaders who turn A-players into a B-team._line_In our view, HiPo interventions should focus on predicting who is likely to become a key driver of organizational performance. That is, they should define future stars as the people who will \u201cconsistently generate exorbitant output levels that influence the success or failure of their organizations.\u2019\u2019 Fortunately, science reveals that regardless of the context, job, and industry, such individuals tend to share a range of measurable qualities, which can be identified fairly early in the process._line_In a review that compared scientific research on predictors of job performance to the qualities in highest demand for the 21st century workforce, we identified three general markers of high potential._line_Ability_line_The first category concerns indications that an individual is able to do the job in question. The best leading indicator here is demonstrating the knowledge and skill it takes to perform the key tasks that make up the job. The single-best predictor of job performance is a work sample test \u2014 where you observe the candidate actually performing the tasks that make up the job._line_However, in forecasting potential to excel in a bigger, more complex job at some point in the future, the question shifts to how likely an individual is to be able to learn and master the requisite knowledge and skill. The single-best predictor of this is IQ or cognitive ability. Learning ability includes a substantial cognitive component but also the motivation to pick up new knowledge and skills fast and flexibly._line_Any role requires abilities beyond cognitive ability. For instance, potential for performing in a leadership role at the executive level requires strategic thinking and the ability to adapt an organization for the long-term future. In addition to raw intellectual horse power, this involves vision and imagination, as well as an entrepreneurial mindset. Thus early indicators of the ability for senior organizational leadership would also include creativity and a knack for systems thinking._line_Social skills_line_The next big category reflects the growing significance of team work and collaboration in modern organizations. At a basic level, employees have to be able to get along and earn the support of supervisors and coworkers. Indeed, the number one reason for managerial derailment is relationships problems._line_Social skills involve two fundamental abilities: the ability to manage yourself and the ability to manage others (relationships). Employees likely to succeed in bigger, more complex jobs are first able to manage themselves \u2014 to handle increased pressure, deal constructively with adversity, and act with dignity and integrity. Secondly, they are able to establish and maintain cooperative working relationships, build a broad network of contacts and form alliances, and be influential and persuasive with a range of different stakeholders. And for senior roles, they have to be able to develop sophisticated political skills \u2014 the ability to read an audience, decode the unspoken rules, and find solutions that satisfy the often competing interests of key power brokers._line_The ability to manage oneself and to manage others are the core elements of emotional intelligence. So an early indicator of high potential is emotional intelligence, which can be assessed by psychometric tests and further refined through training and development._line_Drive_line_The third category concerns the will and motivation to work hard, achieve, and do whatever it takes to get the job done. It is easily identified as work ethic and ambition \u2014 an ability to remain dissatisfied with one\u2019s achievements. This deeply motivational category is the accelerator that multiplies the potential influence of ability and social skills on future success. Ability and social skill may be considered talent; but potential is talent multiplied by drive as this will determine how much ability and social skills get put to use._line_Drive can be assessed by standardized tests that measure conscientiousness, achievement motivation, and ambition. It can also be identified behaviorally \u2014 as signaled by how hard an individual works, willingness to take on extra duties and assignments, eagerness for more responsibility, and even readiness to sacrifice. For instance, many executive-level roles require a global mindset and some degree of cross-cultural experience. The willingness to embrace a degree of psychological and even physical discomfort and relocate in order to gain the experience and develop these skills separates talented individuals from true high potentials._line_In sum, most organizations could probably upgrade their talent identification processes if they keep things simple and focus on these three generic markers of potential. Not many employees are highly able, socially skilled, and driven \u2014 but if you bet on those who are, which involves evaluating these qualities as accurately as you can, you will end up with a higher proportion of future stars who will contribute disproportionately to the organization. Investing in those individuals will produce the highest ROI._line_

VIf you work away from the home, you may be looking for dogs who can be left alone \u2014 at least while you\u2019re at the office. First, remember that dogs are social animals. Dog parents who work away from home still need to prioritize time for their dogs\u2019 daily mental and physical exercise and interaction. Secondly, 9 to 5 owners do well to choose breeds that manage solo hours without undue boredom, stress, gloom or destruction. Let\u2019s hear from five self-proclaimed dogs who can be left alone for a reasonable amount of time without serious separation anxiety:_line_The Pekingese is a pretty independent dog breed. Photography courtesy Dian Thomas._line_Developed long ago in China, we were favored Imperial companions. At times carried in our owners\u2019 sleeves, we were bred in diverse colors to coordinate with wardrobes. Today, you needn\u2019t carry me often. I\u2019m sturdier than many toy breeds, and I appreciate walks and outings. And while I love family time, I don\u2019t commonly languish when you\u2019re working. I\u2019m naturally inclined to put my paws up, so a relaxing day suits me. If your house and heart can accommodate two Pekes, however, we\u2019ll enjoy the company. And if you have a safe environment for me to move from indoors to outdoors, I\u2019d appreciate a doggie door. We\u2019re a self-determining breed. Of course, we want to come and go as we please!_line_Greyhounds are content to curl up on the couch when you\u2019re not home. Photography courtesy Cyndi Swanson._line_An ancient breed famous for extraordinary speed, we also excel in relaxing on your couch. We\u2019re affectionate, easy keepers. We do, however, need a chance to run in a fenced area since we instinctively chase moving creatures. Many of us are retired racing Greyhounds who are hopeful for home life. With training and love, we transform from racers to relaxed buddies. Whether bred for racing or companionship, it\u2019s quite remarkable how adaptable and easygoing we are in homes. Did I mention we have thin skin and little fat? We like your soft, cushy furniture better than the floor!_line_Great Pyrenees. Photography via Shutterstock._line_Used for centuries in southwestern Europe\u2019s mountainous areas, I was bred as a sheep guardian dog. I often protected sheep alone, which explains my occasional skepticism about human commands. Though reserved with strangers, I take good care of my family. I also don\u2019t insist on endless sports or activities. In fact, although I\u2019m serious about my watchdog work, I like to simply nap with one eye open. Don\u2019t let my large size fool you \u2014 I can jump to attention quickly if needed. I expect daily exercise, but I\u2019m relatively calm indoors. All bets are off, though, if you leave me outside. I may bark at each new happening. And when you get home from work, I\u2019ll want to walk with you, lean on you (yes, we do that!) and hang out with you._line_Alaskan Malamutes definitely need attention \u2014 but they don\u2019t nag! Photography courtesy Beth Dulea._line_We\u2019re the biggest Arctic sled dog, bred to haul heavy loads for Inuit tribes. We worked hard for man, often using our own judgment to assess ice conditions and determine safe routes. These days, we welcome time with you but we demonstrate a self-ruling spirit. We\u2019re deemed playful upon invitation \u2014 that means we don\u2019t endlessly nag for attention. We do thrive on outdoor exercise. May I suggest an extra outing on weekends, such as sledding or hiking? On workdays, if I have a walk or a romp before you leave, I\u2019ll likely doze until dinner. Caveat: if you\u2019re gone too long (or forget to walk us!), we may howl our disapproval._line_Sealyham Terriers aren\u2019t an overly demanding breed. Photography courtesy Sandy Schneider._line_We\u2019re inquisitive and self-confident, but not overly demanding. We were developed in Wales for hunting, following our prey even underground. My forefathers were bred by Captain John Tucker-Edwardes to hunt fox, rats, badgers and rabbits. In time, our companionship was as valued as our work. We shared our lives with Hollywood celebrities such as Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart. Today, we\u2019re a comparatively rare breed, eager to bond with families. We expect walks, attention and chances to explore our worlds, but when we\u2019re indoors we\u2019re relatively calm. Now, for weekends, may I suggest a Barn Hunt?_line_

VBitcoin continues to march back towards its record highs, breaking back above $4600 for the first time since September 8th._line_So what will it take for the digital currency to get back to record highs above $5000 and beyond?_line_Forbes' Panos Mourdoukoutas offers several possible catalysts..._line_The return of buzz, which will bring buyers back to the market. And that will take a catalyst, like the rollback of China\u2019s ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which killed Bitcoin\u2019s buzz in the first place._line_The ban may be temporary, to appease international agencies and hardcore communist members ahead of the upcoming Communist Party convention, as written in a previous piece here._line_Another catalyst could be a financial crisis which could make Bitcoin the \u201csafe heaven\u201d asset, as investors flee financial assets. Like the 2008-9 financial crisis that extended across almost every asset category. Or a sovereign debt crisis._line_Then there\u2019s the prospect of a regional war, beginning either in North Korea or the South China Sea, which would disrupt global trade; or in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia and Iran are moving closer to an open war._line_And there\u2019s the prospect of an endorsement by a major Wall Street institution, which wouled increase awareness among investors, helping the demand for Bitcoin cross the \u201ctipping point\u201d and reach cascade._line_How likely is it that any of these catalysts will materialize? They are all likely, but it takes time._line_The Chinese Communist Party Convention, for instance, will be over at the end of this month. This means that the first catalyst may materialize soon after._line_Time may get close for the second catalyst, as financial markets undergo a crisis, every 8-10 years; and eight years have already lapsed since the last crisis._line_As of the other two catalysts, it\u2019s hard to set a time._line_That\u2019s why investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should take a longer view on placing their bets on the digital currency, always keeping in mind that Bitcoin is an alternative to national currencies, and the \u201cnew gold,\u201d a hedge against global uncertainty._line_These views come just days after American tech billionaire investor and television personality Mark Cuban recently claimed that he sees Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the way of the future. As CoinTelegraph.com reports, he also countered the various claims that the leading digital currency is not real and has no intrinsic value._line_In an interview with Bloomberg, the renowned American businessman claimed that Bitcoin is just like the traditional stocks that investors can buy and sell._line_\u201c...it's interesting because I think there are a lot of assets that have values based on just supply and demand. You know, most stocks, they don't have any intrinsic value, no true ownership rights, no voting rights, you just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. They're like baseball cards and I think Bitcoin is the same thing...\u201d_line_Cuban also said that he has been looking to buy into Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market ever since and he confirmed that he already invested in the leading digital currency, as well as some initial coin offerings (ICO)._line_\u201c...I have bought some, bought it through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange because that gave me liquidity. I am also involved with ICOs, actually token sales, because I think Blockchain is a great platform for future applications...\u201d_line_His most recent statements are quite far from his previous perception as he earlier called Bitcoin as \u2018bubble\u2019. His company\u2019s recent moves, however, seem to be bullish of cryptocurrencies as his team have been investing in ICOs and Blockchain projects._line_

VPhotograph: Courtesy Geffen Playhouse_line_Actor Arye Gross first graced the Geffen Playhouse stage in 2012, when he portrayed the idealized but endearingly real father, Mr. Abramowitz, in the premiere of Donald Margulies\u2019s Coney Island Christmas. The performance was a thrilling experience for Gross, who in his teen years lived in Westwood and claims to have loitered in the Scandinavian furniture store that once occupied what is now the theater\u2019s lobby._line_Gross is one of those actors you may not know by name but would certainly recognize. He first appeared in films such as Soul Man and Tequila Sunrise in the 1980s, and played Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s roommate on Ellen,_line_ with later recurring roles in Castle and Six Feet Under._line_In the theater world, he\u2019s one of the most familiar and universally admired actors on Los Angeles stages. Audiences know him from South Coast Repertory\u2019s rendition of Our Mother\u2019s Brief Affair,as the articulate but puzzled son; his part as the gently agonized title role in Antaeus Theatre Company\u2019s Uncle Vanya; and his turn as the heavy-handed editor in Pasadena Playhouse\u2019s Above the Fold._line_Though his list of theater and television credits may be long, Gross performs alone onstage for the first time in his career when he returns to the Geffen this fall in the Playhouse\u2019s production of Glen Berger\u2019s Underneath the Lintel. Berger wrote this solo play, which bears the subtitle An Impressive Presentation of Lovely Evidences, more than 17 years ago. The Actors\u2019 Gang premiered it in 2001, and since then it\u2019s traveled the nation. Now, at long last, director Steven Robman has delivered the script into the hands of the actor who may serve it best. _line_Arye Gross_line_Gross plays a librarian living in a small town in the Netherlands, who becomes consumed with the story behind a book that\u2019s 113 years overdue and suddenly is returned in the library\u2019s overnight slot. \u201cHe cannot just let that go,\u201d says Gross. \u201cHe\u2019s got to find out who returned it and who checked it out.\u201d The librarian engages in rhetorical conversation with the audience about his attempts to discover the book\u2019s history and whether to continue onward\u2014though Gross says he hopes the audience doesn\u2019t answer back, which he worries would require him to be clever on his feet._line_Though many of us may have difficulty recalling the last time we checked a book out of a library, Gross remembers. He checked it out for this play: a tome about 18th-century English landscape painter Joseph Wright of Derby, whose work factors into the librarian\u2019s historical scavenger hunt._line_\u201cThe situation that faces the librarian is that, in order to follow the most miraculous thing that\u2019s ever happened in his life, he has to give up everything,\u201d says Gross. \u201cAnd the evening has to do with his dilemma.\u201d When asked if Gross would be inclined to follow his character\u2019s path, he pauses and says with a smile, \u201cthat is the question.\u201d_line_Underneath the Lintel is at Geffen Playhouse Tue\u2013Sun at various times from Oct 10 through Nov 19 (geffenplayhouse.com). $60\u2013$80. _line_ For any feedback or for more information email blognetwork@timeout.com _line_

VEight years after it was launched, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana remains hamstrung by inflexible procedures and an inadequate coverage ceiling, finds new evaluation of its impact._line_Health insurance in low- and middle-income countries is recognised as a strategy to improve health access and facilitate Universal Health Care (UHC) by reducing the financial burden of accessing good health._line_In India\u2019s public health calendar, the recent past has been eventful. The head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, has become the first Indian on the global leadership team of the World Health Organisation. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the state with one of India\u2019s worst health indicators, has challenged Kerala, by far the best performer on those indicators, to \u201csee how the system works\u201d in his state. And an evaluation of a flagship health insurance scheme for the poor has found that it \u201chas been ineffective in reducing the burden of out-of-pocket spending on poor households\u201d._line_While the first two piqued greater interest, the quantitative evaluation of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), carried out eight years after its launch, is extremely important._line_\u201cOne of the main objectives of any health insurance scheme is to provide financial coverage (or risk protection) by reducing such burden while enhancing use of healthcare,\u201d Dr Anup Karan of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and first author of the study, Extending health insurance to the poor in India: An impact evaluation of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana on out-of-pocket spending for healthcare, told The Indian Express._line_\u201cWe found that RSBY has not been able to reduce out-of-pocket payment for healthcare for the poor, and they face the catastrophic impact of such payments,\u201d Dr Karan said._line_Health insurance in low- and middle-income countries is recognised as a strategy to improve health access and facilitate Universal Health Care (UHC) by reducing the financial burden of accessing good health. WHO DG Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus has repeatedly stressed that UHC is a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d governments must make, irrespective of income levels. Dr Winnie Yip, professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, said, \u201cTo move towards UHC, risk pooling and prepayment are necessary. When a large proportion of health expenditure is funded by out-of-pocket payment, as is the case in India, households or individuals are subject to major financial risk when they fall ill, because there is no sharing of risk.\u201d_line_In India, insurance is often associated with for-profit private insurance, Dr Yip said, when \u201cthe majority of the world\u2019s insurance is social or public health insurance\u201d. In Thailand, UHC has been implemented using social insurance. \u201cComplete tax revenue financing, like in the UK, is not feasible for lower and lower-middle income countries, including India. To have the government pay for everybody and everything (is not feasible), so individual contribution is needed,\u201d Dr Yip said._line_***_line_RSBY, a tax-financed health insurance that is managed through private insurance companies, was introduced in 2008 for inpatient care to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. Over 40 million families were enrolled till September 2016. The evaluation, also co-authored by Dr Ajay Mahal of the University of Melbourne, was published in the peer reviewed Journal of Social Medicine. It used cross-sectional household-level survey data from the 1999-2000, 2004-05 and 2011-12 phases of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), and district records of enrolment information._line_So, where is India going wrong with the first national scheme of its kind?_line_For starters, the authors advocate the immediate inclusion of outpatient care in the insurance scheme. Outpatient care comprises up to 70% of total healthcare utilisation in India and 60% of total health expenditure. \u201cUnless full, or at least chronic conditions, are covered, I don\u2019t think any scheme can provide any significant financial risk protection to Indian families,\u201d Dr Karan said. This, he said, was particularly critical for the poor, \u201cas they would prefer not to get hospitalised and lose their work days and wages\u201d._line_Dr Yip explained that because OP is not covered, \u201cpeople could delay seeking care until they are more severely ill, which is costly both from the perspective of costs and health\u201d._line_Despite rising healthcare costs, the scheme continues to be capped at Rs 30,000 since 2008. \u201cThere has not been any revision, while the costs of hospitalisation have almost doubled,\u201d Dr Karan said. For a family of 4 or 4.5 persons, it was \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d, he said, when the average expenditure on one hospitalisation in the private sector is around Rs 26,000. \u201cThis means that even if one member of the family gets hospitalised in a year, the financial coverage is exhausted,\u201d Dr Karan said. Also, the cap does not take into account post-hospitalisation costs._line_***_line_The one positive impact of the scheme was in non-medical spending, the study found. Explaining the \u201cvirtual income transfer\u201d effect of the scheme, Dr Karan said, \u201cThe poor increased their household consumption level, or non-medical spending, after RSBY intervention. The increase is very small, but statistically significant. This is certainly an indirect benefit of the scheme which needs deeper exploration.\u201d_line_The authors also caution that beneficiaries may have been persuaded by providers to utilise inpatient services that were not covered by RSBY, or denied care. \u201cMost countries have found that health insurance without changing provider behaviour usually results in cost inflation. It was found that it is necessary to establish \u2018strategic purchasing\u2019 through quality monitoring, using provider payment methods that incentivise providers to reduce unnecessary prescriptions and tests, and establishing an IT system to audit providers,\u201d Dr Yip said. Without these steps, she said, \u201cno matter how much more RSBY increases coverage, it still may not reduce financial risk\u201d._line_Impact evaluation is considered increasingly necessary in all realms of public policy, to understand what is working and what isn\u2019t. In India, Dr Karan said, there are only a few examples of rigorous impact evaluation, and fewer still for health financing schemes. The study gives the examples of four state social health insurance schemes, which reached mixed conclusions._line_For example, an evaluation of the Yeshasvini scheme in Karnataka by researchers from Delhi University, reported an over 70% reduction in out-pocket spending, and a 30% reduction in borrowings. Evaluating the Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme in Andhra Pradesh in 2012, the nonprofit thinktank Centre for Global Development found reduced inpatient out-of-pocket spending among enrolled families in phase I of the study, but relatively small impacts on outpatient out-of-pocket spending, and catastrophic payments._line_

V A couple weeks back, I was playing PUBG and I raged and somewhat pulled my earbuds out of the front panel socket too hard and now for some reason if I plug it in all the way sound will only play on the left sound of the earbuds but if i slightly pull the earbuds out, both sides will play. This isn't much of a problem but, there is no surround sound when this happens and annoys me because I cannot tell which side shots are coming from.

VJosh Lilley Gallery presents \u201cDe Ramp\u201d, fourth solo exhibition of British painter NICK GOSS._line_Nick Goss was born in 1981 in Bristol. He graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art in 2006 and received Postgraduate Degree from the Royal Academy, London, in 2009. In his early years he spent the summers in Zeeland, a picturesque lowland in West Holland, where a devastating North Sea flood occurred in 1953, which was named \u2018De Ramp\u2019. The narration of this event about displacement of people and animals, their helplessness affected the artist hugely. Afterwards, J. G. Ballard\u2019s \u201cThe Drowned World\u201d about a devastating flood in London inspired him to create his series of painting \u201cDe Ramp\u201d._line_In this series, the artist draws pictures of semi-drowned horse wading through water, old women trudging with their earthly belongings towards unknown shelters. In the paintings, the artist gradually increased the water level in each scene, while subtly adding some minute details of the present day London, so that the effect becomes more gruesome on the viewers.The artist presents the paintings of De Ramp as if they are changing before the viewers. The Known landscape of London metamorphoses before us. The lone residential towers sprout up above the floodwaters and may be interpreted as tombstones or flowers \u2013 memories of life lost or tributes to life beginning again. They are also, simply, the things that the artist sees when he looks out his studio window. Goss\u2019 compositions deal with psychological space of crisis and freely fuse it with the world history on reference to the personal history. The compositions are rich with daily observations and literary fantasy that shows pure pictorial effects taken the lessons of centuries of art practices. The images on view at De Ramp challenge at one go the eye and the mind. Yet they can be navigated through one another._line_

On the job, your learning gets limited. I have a passion for science since class 7. Also, I always knew that engineering is my real calling.

During weekends too, I devoted seven-eight hours._line_ I took help of the old GATE papers to understand the pattern and the kind of topics that gets repeated._line_GATE is conducted every year by any of the old IITs. Did you find any similarities in the pattern? _line_I noticed that exam conducting body from IIT focus on certain topics. For instance, IIT Roorkee gives importance to bioprocessing._line_Have you taken any coaching? What were the sections you were not confident about?_line_I followed the test series from some online portals but didn\u2019t find a need to join coaching centres. I was pretty confident on self-study. I found immunology, plant biotechnology and animal technology difficult. _line_Name some important topics that you feel are a must read for any student attempting GATE exam?_line_The following topics are high scoring:_line_ 1) Antibodies and cells of immune system 2) Cell growth and reaction kinetics 3) Resistance in plants 4) Basic integration and differentiation 5) Basics of Vectors and Matrices 6) Flatfile formats in Bioinformatics 7) Antibiotic resistance mechanisms_line_How did you rejuvenate?_line_I am a nerd, science comes naturally to me and therefore I feel happy studying it.

Vasan Srinivasan, member of Australian Multicultural Council, said, \u201cSchools here have an option to opt for any international language as a second language. This year, they introduced Kannada as one of the Indian languages to be taught in schools. Textbooks from K\u2019taka: P5_line_The teaching materials, including text books, are airlifted from Karnataka to Australia, said Srirangan Kanzal, a healthcare professional. \u201cThe language is taught in three levels. For beginners, we teach basics like Varnamale (alphabets). For those who already know the basics, the syllabus will be upgraded,\u201d he said._line_\u201cInitially, we use the translation method (English to Kannada) to familiarise them with the language. Later, we teach them to read and write. Now, we are teaching them Kannada rhymes,\u201d Kanzal added. \u201cAs there are no examins till Class 12 here, students can pick any language. If they are confident of scoring good marks, they can opt for any international language as second language for the Class 12 board exam,\u201d said Vasan Srinivasan, member of Australian Multicultural Council._line_

VNew Delhi [India], Oct. 9 (ANI): The sport of Golf is gaining momentum in India with a breezy pace. Bounded by natural prettiness with green grass all around, the country boasts some of world\u2019s best Golf courses._line_Emerging trend of playing golf among the youth has motivated the government and private players to improve infrastructure including golf courses of international standards and trained manpower. The government is now keen to exploit golf tourism in its true potential, and aims to promote Golf for the development of overall ecosystem of tourism._line_\u201cWe are grateful to the Ministry of Tourism who have initiated a Golf Tourism Policy \u2013 how to promote India as a golf tourism destination. In India, we have beautiful golf courses; right from Jammu and Kashmir to Deep South we have one of the best golf courses in the world. Golf needs a good weather, and in India, out of 365 days, almost 324 days are sunny, which are very rare in the world. So, that is very important for golf,\u201d said Rajan Sehgal, President, India Golf Tourism Association._line_India has about 220 golf courses, in which 25 are signature golf courses which are at par with international standards. Many private resorts and golf courses are providing its guests the world\u2019s best dining, open-air Jacuzzis along with the golfing facilities._line_One such property is the nine-acre large Jaypee Greens Golf and Spa Resort, located on the outskirts of the national capital. Designed by veteran golfer Greg Norman, the resort promises some of the most stunning views of the beautiful 18-hole golf course. It attracts many foreign tourists who love to spend their time by playing golf along with dining._line_\u201cJay Pee is one of the most beautiful golf courses. It\u2019s easy to come and play here as a guest, and as a visitor. For me, it is very comfortable because it is near to Delhi and the level and quality of the course is very high. I have seen lot of course in the world and I think it\u2019s one of the best in India,\u201d said Alexander, a tourist from Russia._line_To promote golf culture and attract tourists, over 100 new golf courses are required in the country.

VBILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages. _line_Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee. _line_The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday. _line_The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors. _line_Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. \u201cWe are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,\u201d he said. _line_Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf. _line_Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States. _line_The tropical depression\u2019s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida\u2019s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts. _line_Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi. _line_In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot. _line_Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D\u2018Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi. _line_\u201cI\u2018m just glad,\u201d he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. \u201cI was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can\u2019t stop it.\u201d _line_Water flowed through Ursula Staten\u2019s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house. _line_\u201cI have a mess,\u201d the retired massage therapist said. \u201cIf we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.\u201d _line_ Lighthouse Pier is seen damaged by Hurricane Nate, in Biloxi, Mississippi, U.S., October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman _line_At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry. _line_Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate. _line_But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges. _line_U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief. _line_Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said. _line_Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it. _line_Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said. _line_NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED _line_Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago. _line_\u201cI had prayed for this - that we would be spared,\u201d said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana\u2019s equivalent to a county. _line_Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move. _line_New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon. _line_Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday. _line_The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey. _line_The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador. _line_Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles._line_

V Many of the idols created for Durga Puja are works of exquisite art and hence, worthy of preservation. Taking this into consideration, the State Government, as well as some private individuals and organisations, are going to turn some of the best Durga idols of Kolkata and its suburbs into permanent exhibits. The idol carved out of mahogany wood by the famous artiste, Bhabatosh Sutar, created for Chetla Agrani, will be permanently preserved at Eco Park by the State Government. This is being done at Eco Park for the last few years. Bhabatosh Sutar is himself involved in a preservation. The 6 feet-tall terracotta idol of Baidyabagan Nabapally at Singhi More in Amtala, made in the traditional style by veteran artiste, Biswanath Kumbhakar of Panchmura in Bankura, is going to be preserved at the artistes' conclave, Chander Haat, at Barisha, on the outskirts of Kolkata. Another venue for preservation is the Phire Dekha (meaning 'looking back') gallery beside Rabindra Sarovar Lake. Since the gallery is being renovated, no clay idols have been chosen for preservation this year. instead four fibre glass idols are being preserved the ones exhibited at Jagat Mukherjee Park, Shiv Mandir, Buroshibtala and Barisha Udayan Pally.UNI SJC KK_line_

VNearly 60 years ago, the US Navy launched Vanguard-1 as a response to the Soviet Sputnik. Six decades on, it\u2019s still circling our planet._line_From his desk at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, space debris analyst Tim Flohrer keeps track of the 23,000 or so catalogued objects currently orbiting the Earth. They range from spacecraft and satellites \u2013 some working, most not \u2013 to discarded rocket stages and fragmented space hardware. All of them the result of 60 years of space exploration._line_Using radar data from the US Space Surveillance Network (also, primarily, the country\u2019s early warning system) and observations from optical telescopes, Flohrer helps ensure none of this space junk puts operational spacecraft at risk._line_Before we speak, I\u2019ve asked him to check on object 1958-002B, also known as Vanguard 1. Launched in March 1958, this grapefruit-sized shiny metal sphere was boosted into a high elliptical orbit. And it\u2019s still there, passing between 650 and 3,800km (406 to 2,375 miles) from the Earth._line_\u201cThe earlier satellites, such as Sputnik, have all re-entered the atmosphere,\u201d says Flohrer. \u201cBut I estimate that Vanguard 1 will remain in orbit for several hundred, if not a thousand years.\u201d_line_Conceived by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in 1955, Vanguard was to be America\u2019s first satellite programme. The Vanguard system consisted of a three-stage rocket designed to launch a civilian scientific spacecraft. The rocket, satellite and an ambitious network of tracking stations would form part of the US contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. This global collaboration of scientific research involved 67 nations, including both sides of the Iron Curtain._line_\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a space race,\u201d says NRL Historian, Angelina Callahan. \u201cThe US was always forthright in terms of launch and intended purposes for the satellite but the Soviets held their cards closer to their chest.\u201d_line_So, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik on 4 October 1957, it came as a shock. \u201cA lot of the disappointment of Sputnik [for the US satellite team] was from the fact that their partners in this international partnership were not telling them they were sending a satellite up,\u201d says Callahan._line_The rockets that launched the Vanguard satellites were based on the German V-2 design (Credit: Getty Images)_line_\u201cThere was tremendous fear generated by Sputnik,\u201d says Tom Lassman, curator of Cold War rockets at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. An identical \u201cflight backup\u201d of the Vanguard 1 satellite is on display at the Institution\u2019s Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport._line_\u201cSputnik made military leaders realise the Soviet Union could hit us with a missile.\u201d In the weeks that followed the Soviet launch, pressure from the Eisenhower White House mounted on the Navy team to launch a US satellite as soon as possible._line_On 6 December 1957, what had originally been planned as a further incremental test of Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 (TV3) became a major public event. Whereas the Soviets only announced Sputnik after it had successfully reached orbit, politicians, senior military figures and the world\u2019s media gathered at Cape Canaveral, Florida for the US launch._line_ There\u2019s a lot of failure in a successful research and development process \u2013 Angelina Callahan, NRL historian _line_After a series of countdown delays, at 11:44, the Vanguard rocket lifted from the launch pad. A few seconds later, someone in the control room shouted: "Look out! Oh God, no!" as the rocket rose four feet in the air and crashed back to the ground in a ball of flame. The nose cone was thrown clear \u2013 the Vanguard satellite still beeping. (You can read a full account of the disaster in this Nasa report)._line_The New York Times described the explosion as a \u201cblow to US prestige\u201d, Senator Lyndon Johnson called it \u201chumiliating\u201d. Others were even less diplomatic \u2013 newspapers dubbing the US satellite variously \u201cflopnik\u201d, \u201ckaputnik\u201d and \u201cstayputnik\u201d._line_For the NRL team, it really wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of failure in a successful research and development process,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cDuring the course of these failures, they developed a very good system.\u201d_line_Ex-Nazi rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun, who had long been pushing to launch something \u2013 anything \u2013 into orbit, seized the opportunity. With backing from the US Army, he had been developing the Jupiter rocket \u2013 an evolution of his V2 ballistic missile._line_The Vanguard programme was beset with several launch failures (Credit: US Navy)_line_\u201cThe priority was to get something up as quickly as possible,\u201d says Lassman._line_On 31 January 1958, one of von Braun\u2019s Jupiter launchers blasted Explorer 1 \u2013 a satellite designed and built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California in just three months \u2013 into orbit. America\u2019s first satellite was fitted with a cosmic ray detector to measure the space radiation environment. Designed by James Van Allen of the University of Iowa, the instrument revealed a belt of charged particles trapped by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which became known as the Van Allen Belts._line_Finally, on 17 March 1958, it was the Navy\u2019s turn. Under clear skies, NRL\u2019s Vanguard rocket carried Vanguard 1 into orbit. The tiny spacecraft was soon sending back its first radio signals. In fact, because it was the first satellite powered by solar cells, the spacecraft was still transmitting data until 1965. Explorer 1 only lasted a few months._line_ Not only is Vanguard 1 still in orbit, its legacy lives on _line_Although not the first satellite, Vanguard 1 was still a remarkable achievement. As well as proving the technology of a new launcher system, the ground station network and solar cells, the satellite showed how our planet bulges out around the equator. Equipped with an instrument to measure atmospheric density, it provided the first-ever measurements of the Earth\u2019s tenuous outer atmosphere and an estimate of the number of micrometeorites surrounding the planet \u2013 all vital information for future spacecraft. As a military-funded project, this also fed into calculations for the accuracy of ICBM trajectories._line_Not only is Vanguard 1 still in orbit, its legacy lives on. The rocket system forms the basis for the Delta launch vehicle, one of the world\u2019s most successful launchers. Long term tracking of the satellite continues to help scientists understand the influence of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on satellites and how orbits decay over time._line_Perhaps most importantly, Vanguard 1 revealed the potential of satellites on which we\u2019re all now dependent._line_Vanguard 3, which is at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, bears the damage from its failed launch (Credit: Audin/Wikimedia Commons)_line_\u201cThe NRL produced a classified report talking about the satellites the US Navy would need in future decades,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cIt included weather, navigation, communication and reconnaissance satellites and the report closed with all the science that would be needed to make those systems viable.\u201d_line_Sixty years on, that science and those predictions have become reality. The satellite that helped make this possible, and the team behind it, deserve to be remembered._line_\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d says Lassman. \u201cWe not only have an artefact in the museum, we have one flying around in space \u2013 it\u2019s living history.\u201d_line_--_line_Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter._line_

During this time, all of the traumatic things in his life that have been making him afraid, making him doubtful, making him unable to enjoy his life, have been erased. His neurotransmitters and neuropathways have been completely re-wired. So when he comes awake, he's like an eight-year-old or 12-year-old boy," Ruffalo said. _line_ The actor added: "He has the same exuberance and curiosity and wonder. He finally also realizes that he's free of the Hulk."_line_ Describing Hulk's changes, Ruffalo said: "Hulk can be sad or happy. He's speaking. He's not only alive because of rage, so we can start to have more geography in the character's emotional life, his intelligence, what he does, what he eats, if he sleeps -- all the questions I've been dying to ask for years since playing this part. _line_ "It's a different Banner and a different Hulk. So I get to play two totally different characters in this movie, which is really fun."_line_ For Ruffalo, one lasting memory of working on the film was the welcoming ceremony by aboriginal natives at the start of production. _line_ "Taika Waititi, the director, is a Maori. So the people who did the ceremony are his Maori brothers here in Australia. They came to bless the movie. I've been to Native American blessings for the climate march in America that we had a couple years ago. They're always beautiful and sincere and invigorating and lovely and communal," Ruffalo said. _line_ The actor says he was excited to be part of the welcoming ceremony on this movie. _line_ "There's a lot of wisdom in that culture that we could carry with us. It was really beautiful and moving. I do feel like we were blessed," he added._line_ "Thor: Ragnarok" is set to release on November 3._line_ --IANS dc/rb/dg_line_( 355 Words)_line_

VIt may sound like a long process, but it'll be worth it._line_Anyone who has started going gray knows it doesn't happen overnight. You don't suddenly wake up with silver strands as if someone painted them while you slept; it starts with a pigment-deprived hair or two while some of your hair still grows in full color. And when more of your hair starts growing gray, you may start to notice a demarcation line in larger sections of your hair where the color stopped and the gray started._line_Going gray is a process, but realizing it's happening can feel very sudden. You may know immediately that you want to cover it with dye, or you may consider embracing the gray. In the case of our Birnur Aral, Ph.D., Director of the Good Housekeeping Institute's Health, Beauty and Environmental Sciences Lab, she did a little bit of both._line_"I had an unrelated allergic reaction that made my lips swell up for a few weeks, so I skipped my monthly hair color visit in order to give my body a break," explains Dr. Aral, who had been coloring her hair since her late 20s to cover up grays. "My roots grew about an inch, and I started noticing the salt-and-pepper pattern of my natural hair and toying with the idea of going gray."_line_Ultimately, Dr. Aral decided to go fully gray, and her experience both personally and professionally \u2014 this scientist has tested a whole lot of hair dye in her 20-plus years at the GH Institute! \u2014 can serve as a guide for you if you're ready to make the switch._line_Here's what you need to know._line_1. A "color correction" can save you from growing it out._line_"Letting the roots grow would have been the cheapest solution but not the most stylish," Dr. Aral says. "Some people let the roots grow for an inch or two and then just get a pixie cut and transition that way. I wasn't ready for a drastic change of color and cut at the same time."_line_Instead, she opted for consultation with colorist Anne Marie Barros of Rubann in New York City. You have the option of essentially getting a "color correction," but instead of correcting it your natural or dyed color, your colorists correct it to be more like the gray shade growing in._line_Dr. Aral before her first appointment._line_2. The transition process is a lot like getting highlights._line_ "To match the salt-and-pepper look of my roots, the colorist put in baby highlights all over my head," Dr. Aral says, noting that the foils stayed on much longer than she had personally experienced while coloring her hair in the past. "Toward the end of the lifting process, the colorist applied dark brown hair color to the remaining hair to create an all-over salt-and-pepper effect. When the foils were taken out and my hair was rinsed, a toner was applied to turn the highlights into a cool gray and silver."_line_Depending on the color you're transitioning away from, your experience may be different. And even if you're rarin' to go, you may have to wait a while before you even begin the process._line_"I tell people to get at least two inches of growth to begin with," says Nikki Ferrara, colorist at New York's Serge Normant at John Frieda. "Then I start to highlight."_line_3. It can take a while \u2014 and get expensive._line_If you've never lightened your hair before, you could find yourself in the salon for an unexpected length of time during the coloring process._line_"I spent a total of seven hours in the salon and really saw how intensive the process was to justify the price tag," Dr. Aral explains. That price tag? About $500. That, of course, can vary with your starting color, your hair length, the salon you go to and the level of experience your colorist has._line_The initial highlighting session isn't the only thing that can take a while._line_It can take anywhere from six months to a year to fully go from color to gray, Ferrara says._line_4. Some upkeep is required before your color is fully grown out._line_As with going platinum or any cooler blonde shade, you may find that the gray "highlights" get a little brassy. "The highlighted parts turn a bit yellow once the gray toner starts washing out," Dr. Aral said._line_Your colorist may also recommend coming in for more toner or glosses during the course of your transition. "Usually, you will have to gloss every once in a while to keep the brassiness at bay," Ferrara says._line_To help keep warm yellow tones at bay with less frequent salon visits, consider using a purple-toned shampoo like Clairol Shimmer Lights. This balances out brassiness and keeps your gray a gorgeous silver shade._line_Dr. Aral after her initial color treatment._line_5. It's an adjustment \u2014 but worth it._line_Just like with any new hair color, you may find that how you normally do your makeup and hair or your wardrobe may not be as flattering as you once thought._line_"I feel with gray hair I need to have my hair styled \u2014 blown out or ironed \u2014 and makeup on; otherwise I look older than my usual self," Dr. Aral said. "I also feel like certain patterns and colors don't look good on me anymore. White, grey and black looks good but haven't figured the right bright colors yet."_line_Despite the adjustment, Dr. Aral has no regrets: "At this point I am not thinking of going back as I typically receive positive feedback."_line_Dr. Aral four months after her initial color treatment._line_"Most people won't have the patience, so they choose to color their hair again," Ferrara says. "But it's super-rewarding if you can stick it out and get on a routine with your colorist to get highlights every few months."_line_More From Hair Ideas for 2017_line_

"But their tall claims of efficient drainage system have fallen flat with the flooding even during sporadic rains. _line_ "Encroachments have hit laying of the sewage line, footpath, road widening and installation of streetlights.

VPorsche celebrates its British Le Mans winners with liveried-up 911 Carrera GTSs_line_Porsche loves a special edition 911 almost as much as it loves winning Le Mans. Which is our rather contrived way of introducing you to this trio, the three guises of 911 Carrera 4 GTS British Legends Edition._line_Each has been specced by one of Porsche\u2019s British Le Mans 24 hour victors. So there\u2019s the Carrera White car that pays tribute to Nick Tandy and his Porsche 919 Hybrid (winner of Le Mans in 2015), the Guards Red car that salutes Richard Attwood and his Porsche 917 (victorious in 1970) and the Sapphire Blue car, which is a nod to Derek Bell and his Porsche 962 (a pairing that won in 1982). Bell also took Porsche to Le Mans victory 1981, \u201986 and \u201987, mind\u2026_line_White it\u2019s initially odd that Porsche has used the heavier all-wheel-drive 911 GTS as the British Legend Edition\u2019s base, the spec that lies beneath makes a degree of sense. Massively adjustable electric seats, automatic wipers and widely adjustable suspension \u2013 plus all-weather grip \u2013 may all add weight and complexity to the pureness of a 911, but they do make driving one for a long period of time (y\u2019know, endurance racing style) easier._line_Bell\u2019s car even has a PDK paddleshift gearbox in it. But before the purists write angry comments below, PDK was used in 962s in the 1980s. It\u2019s optional in these limited editions, though, so you can stay manual if you wish._line_Each of the three cars gets colours and decals to mimic the livery of the car it\u2019s influenced by, and Tandy, Attwood and Bell\u2019s signatures feature too. There\u2019s carbon and Alcantara aplenty inside, with perhaps a little more credence than usual thanks to the explicit motorsport link._line_Beneath the rear deck is the same 444bhp 3.0-litre flat-six turbo engine as a standard Carrera GTS, with a 3.6sec 0-62mph time if you\u2019ve gone for PDK. It\u2019s almost precisely half as powerful as Tandy\u2019s circa-900bhp 919 Hybrid, while its 192mph top speed is down 32mph on the 2015 winner._line_Not to worry, though, as it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find yourself short of pace when driving the Mulsanne Straight, as your 911 can only really end up there in the 51 weeks of the year it\u2019s a public road._line_Prices vary depending on colour, ranging from £122,376 for the Attwood red car to £123,210 for Tandy white or Bell blue. Which is a reasonably healthy climb over the £101k of a standard Carrera 4 GTS, though these cars do come with a lot of options boxes ticked, accounting for at least half of the price premium._line_And they will be rare, too. They\u2019re only on sale in the UK, and while Porsche won\u2019t commit to telling us what the production run is, we\u2019d bet the pool of Le Mans die-hards with £123k and the requisite paucity of shyness to run one of these is small._line_Would you?_line_

VLhasa: Seven tourists were fined for chasing Tibetan antelopes in a national reserve in Tibet.

The tourists were fined 105,000 yuan ($16,000) in total for "disturbing rare wildlife's living and breeding"._line_ The population of Tibetan antelope declined sharply from 200,000 to 20,000 due to illegal hunting in the 1980s. Thanks to the habitat protection in the past decade, the population has recovered but the species is still listed among China's first class protected animals. _line_

VThe system, dubbed CornerCameras, can detect moving objects hidden around corners._line_ In spy novels and superhero films, the ability to see through walls has always been a handy \u2014 not to mention, impressive \u2014 trick. And now, this tech could be available to people in real life, with smartphone cameras that can help detect moving objects even if they are hidden around corners, according to a new study._line_ This futuristic-sounding tech could one day help vehicles see around blind corners, the researchers said._line_ "We may eventually be able to use this idea to alert drivers to pedestrians or cars that are about to dart out from behind buildings into a driver's path. Perhaps a few seconds of notice could save lives," said study lead author Katie Bouman, an imaging scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[Mind-Controlled Cats?! 6 Incredible Spy Technologies That Are Real]_line_ "Search and rescue, or helping to understand what is going on behind a wall in a hostage situation, are also potential applications," Bouman added._line_ Researchers have taken many different approaches in trying to make the "superpower" of seeing around corners a reality. For example, in 2015, researchers showed they could use lasers to see objects around corners by firing light pulses at surfaces near the items. Those surfaces could act like mirrors, scattering the laser pulses onto any hidden objects. By analyzing the light that was reflected off the objects and other surfaces back onto the scanners, researchers could reconstruct the shapes of the hidden items._line_ Although most strategies for seeing around corners "are really great ideas," they also "usually require complex modeling [or] specialized hardware, or are computationally expensive," Bouman told Live Science. The 2015 study's technique, for example, required both extremely fast lasers and extraordinarily sensitive cameras._line_ But Bouman and her colleagues' method for seeing around corners simply uses a smartphone camera._line_ "We use light naturally in the scene and do not have to introduce our own light to probe the hidden scene," Bouman said. "This allows us to use common consumer cameras and not specialized equipment to see around corners."_line_ The new system, known as CornerCameras, analyzes light that is reflected off objects hidden around corners and that falls on the ground within the line of sight of the camera. This light is called the "penumbra."_line_The system works by analyzing light at the edge of walls, which is impacted by the reflections of objects around the corner from the camera._line_ The system analyzes this penumbra over several seconds, stitching together dozens of distinct images, according to the study. This data helps the system measure the speed and trajectory of objects around corners in real time. (It does not see any identifying details about those objects \u2014 just the fact that they are moving.)_line_ "I think the biggest surprise was that the system worked well in situations that I would not have expected," Bouman said. "For instance, once, during filming, it started raining. This caused big raindrops to start appearing on the ground, changing the color of the concrete floor."_line_ Because CornerCameras is trying to analyze light signals that are just 0.1 percent of the total brightness of the ground, "I thought these raindrops would wipe out any signal we had," Bouman said. However, CornerCameras analyzes the data of a scene across dozens of images, so "the effect of the raindrops was essentially averaged out."_line_ One current limitation of CornerCameras is that it requires a stationary camera that's held very steady. "In many situations, such as in a collision-avoidance system on a car, you do not have the luxury of a stationary camera," Bouman said. The researchers are now focused on getting the system to work first on a moving wheelchair and eventually on a moving car, she said._line_ Future research will also aim to make CornerCameras work in a variety of lighting situations, or in changing lighting conditions, such as when clouds overhead constantly move in front of the sun. "Getting the system to work in these scenarios would open up the possibility of it being able to be used by a person with a handheld smartphone," Bouman said._line_ Bouman and her colleagues will detail their findings on Oct. 25 at the International Conference on Computer Vision in Venice, Italy._line_

VNagpur: The state's chief wildlife warden, AK Misra, on Monday evening, issued fresh orders to shoot the problem tigress of Bor. After a journey of around 200km, the tigress is moving towards Garamsur near Bor Tiger Reserve again._line_The high court said the order did not reflect efforts to tranquillize the tigress and NTCA SOP was not followed. _line_This is the third order issued since June 23 to shoot the tigress. The fresh order states, "Notwithstanding the order to shoot the tigress, all efforts shall be taken to trap and tranquillize the tigress."_line_However, the court had granted liberty to issue fresh orders. Accordingly, Misra issued fresh order on Monday under Section 11(2) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 to shoot the tigress._line_The order reflects report of the hurriedly constituted seven-member committee under Nagpur deputy conservator G Mallikarjuna._line_The first order was issued on June 23 which was challenged by wildlife lover Dr Jerryl Banait through PIL. The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had stayed the order on June 29._line_The second order was issued on October 4 and it was withdrawn on October 6 after the forest department failed to defend its action before a double bench of justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi._line_The report states that in South Bramhapuri, the tigress had mauled two villagers and injured 4 people in six incident. After it was captured and released in Bor Tiger Reserve on July 29, it has killed two persons and injured one._line_

VRichard Thaler (Pic courtesy: Chicago Booth website)_line_ US academic Richard Thaler, who helped popularise the idea of "nudging" people towards doing what was best for them, won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize on Monday for his work on how human nature affects supposedly rational markets._line_ Influential in the field of behavioural economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term._line_ "I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that," Thaler, a professor at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference._line_ Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: "Richard Thaler's contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making." "His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioural economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy."_line_ Thaler brought to prominence the idea of "nudge" economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviours without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world._line_ In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year's resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep._line_ The issue has relevance for economics as individuals' tendency to fall prey to temptations often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement._line_ Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction._line_ Their book, titled 'Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness' became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters' wrath for raising taxes or banning behaviour outright._line_ "This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of 'nudging' ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making," Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters._line_ "Not only in the United States - there's also a nudging unit for the UK government, there's one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things."_line_ MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN_line_ The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel's 1895 will._line_ Economy is the last of this year's Nobels. The prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were all awarded last week._line_ The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year._line_ While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single women won any Nobel award in 2017._line_ Asked about the disparity, the Academy's secretary general Goran Hansson said they were concerned about the issue and planned a conference with all nominators to discuss it._line_ "Consider this a request for all nominators to also consider female scientists who have made contributions," he said._line_ While few economists are household names, past winners have included Milton Friedman, in 1976, whose work is a cornerstone of current monetary policy, and James Tobin, in 1981, who proposed countries should tax financial transactions._line_

All senior officials have to relieve all the railway staff who have been engaged as domestic help in their homes. _line_Officials say that around 30,000 trackmen work at the homes of senior officials.

It is difficult for me to say what they were though. However, now, these have no logic._line_\u201cAlso, there is a tendency in public organisations to not review protocols which have become archaic, but remain part of the dos and don\u2019ts for officials.

Because of the atmosphere and temperature swings, meaningful occurrences of liquid water on the planet\u2019s surface are almost impossible. And while Mars is thought to have plenty of frozen water at its poles and in underground deposits, the logistics of tapping into these resources could be quite difficult._line_In other words, for any meaningful and long-lasting human presence on Mars, we would likely want to alter the planet and its atmosphere to make it more habitable for human life. And while the exact mechanisms we would use to accomplish this are still up for debate, the basics behind what\u2019s needed to achieve Earth-like conditions are actually pretty straightforward._line_TERRAFORMING 101_line_Today\u2019s infographic comes to us from Futurism, and it details what might need to happen on Mars to make it more accommodating to human life._line_Here are two steps we could take to get Mars into the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d, where water is liquid \u2013 and harmful ionizing radiation like x-rays, UV rays, and gamma rays are not problematic._line_Greenhouse Gases_line_One way to ward off harmful ionizing radiation is to add a thicker layer of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere of Mars. Such an atmosphere would also allows less heat to escape, meaning warmer temperatures on the planet._line_Magnetic Field_line_A strong magnetic field on Earth is something else that makes life easier. Earth\u2019s solid inner core, composed primarily of iron, creates this field when the planet spins \u2013 and it deflects cosmic rays and other harmful types of radiation._line_One interesting solution to solve this problem on Mars would to have a magnetic field generator in front of the planet at all times, deflecting any such rays coming from the sun._line_THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY_line_While terraforming is still a mixture of theory and science fiction at this point, we do know some of the major problems that have to be solved for attaining a habitable environment \u2013 and it will be interesting to see how plans around Mars develop as the prospect of colonization becomes more real._line_You need to live in a dome initially but over time you could terraform Mars to look like Earth and eventually walk around outside without anything on._line_\u2026 So it\u2019s a fixer-upper of a planet._line_\u2013 Elon Musk_line_

V MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday dared his party's ruling ally BJP to "resign" from the Maharashtra government and face midterm polls. _line_ He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his "campaign" for upcoming Gujarat assembly polls. _line_ "I challenge you (the BJP) to resign from the government and face polls once again. We will show you the might of the Shiv Sena. Even during the (Modi) wave, BJP got votes in the name of Sena," Thackeray said, addressing a local poll rally in Nanded. _line_ Nanded-Waghala Municipal Corporation (NWMC) polls are scheduled for October 11. _line_ Taking a dig at Modi, Thackeray said people were now forwarding a joke on social media that the prime minister of India 'may visit India soon', apparently referring to Modi's frequent foreign tours. _line_ "I was watching news on television. Saw the PM campaigning for Gujarat polls that are two-months away. How did he suddenly remember his school today after being in power for three years? Did he not feel like visiting his school ever before? Why just before the polls?" he questioned. _line_ Modi today visited Vadnagar, his birth place in north Gujarat, first time since he became the prime minister. He also visited his school. _line_ The Sena chief further said his father late Bal Thackeray taught him to never tell a lie to people or wear a "mask" (being a hypocrite) and that he has been following it. _line_ "You (the PM) are making an announcement that you have given a Diwali gift to the people by slashing GST rates. Come here to Nanded and visit the homes of farmers. You will know if it is Diwali or 'Diwala' (poverty) for them," he said. _line_ Modi had yesterday said Diwali arrived early for the people, a day after the GST Council announced changes in Goods and Servics Tax, slashing rates on more than 25 products and providing relief to small and medium businesses. _line_ However, the Sena chief said, "Farmers are burdened with debts. Now, like development, even electricity is nowhere to be seen due to a shortage of coal." _line_ He also asked how many rich people stood in the queues after demonetisation. "Lakhs of people lost their jobs but terrorism did not cease. Farmers lost their money kept in cooperative banks," he said. _line_ He asked the gathering if they would vote for a party that "ordered" lathicharge on women students in Banaras Hindu University in Uttar Pradesh, a BJP-ruled state, when they complained against eve teasing. _line_ Thackeray further said that people voted for Nitish Kumar in Bihar for development, despite Modi's financial package of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for the state. "What Nitish Kumar later did is another issue." _line_ Taking a dig at Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, he said that while he may speak of "invisible hands" supporting the BJP, the Sena voices its criticism openly. _line_ "We do not know how to hide and work. We openly criticise if something is wrong. Sharad Pawar's NCP may continue to remain the invisible hands supporting you," he said. _line_ He added that Fadnavis, during the Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Corporation polls, had promised a huge financial package but nobody knew what happened to his promise. _line_

V2014-2016 EcoDiesels will probably be recalled for new software code._line_ If you've been patiently waiting for 2017 Ram EcoDiesel trucks to hit dealerships near you, you're in luck. According to Automotive News, the diesel-powered pickups are now hitting showroom floors after FCA received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency in late July to begin producing them again. And you may want to get in line now, because the EPA has yet to approve the EcoDiesel for the 2018 model year._line_ The EPA, along with the California Air Resources Board, accused FCA in January of 2017 of using eight undeclared pieces of software code in certain Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles. That, naturally, led to "substantially" higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide emissions. The violation applies to about 104,000 vehicles sold between 2014 and 2016. EcoDiesel production was stopped in late 2016._line_ FCA says it's continuing to cooperate with the EPA and CARB. Assuming the two agencies approve the plan, the automaker will recall 2014-2016 Ram and Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles to install the new code. We'd assume that same updated software will be used in 2018 EcoDiesels, too, again assuming they get EPA approval._line_

VThe majority of consumers prefer to shop or do research on a brand's site for products they consider buying._line_CREDIT: Getty Images_line_For generations, retail was simple. Brands sold to retailers and retailer sold to shops. But in the age of the internet, consumers can interact directly with brand manufacturers. And while this may seem like a small thing, it actually has a dramatic change on the way people interact with business owners. A recent study highlights the need for a good brand website as the majority of consumers expect a better experience from a brand sand from a retailer._line_Astound Commerce surveyed 1,000 consumers who shop online and have visited a brand_line_manufacturer's website in the past six months. The survey found the majority of these shoppers (54 percent) turn to brands over retailers for more comprehensive product information, in addition to enhanced customer service, better prices and more personalization options. _line_In fact, more than half (55 percent) of shoppers prefer to shop directly with brand manufacturers over retailers, according to Astound Commerce Insight's "Global Brand Shopper Survey". The researchers also found that 59 percent of respondents already use a brand manufacturer's website for researching products and usually make their purchase there as well. About 37 percent of respondents said they expect a more engaging experience on a brand manufacturer's website than a retailer's. Pricing was also a concern, with half of respondents expecting better prices on a brand manufacturer's website compared to a retailer's website. _line_"The role that brand manufacturers play in today's retail landscape has evolved," said Lauren Freedman, SVP of Digital Strategy for Astound Commerce, in a press release. "Consumers' heightened expectations for digital commerce means brands must master online selling and present compelling and competitive shopping experiences, on par with multi-brand counterparts. Moving forward, brands and retailers must explore even more creative ways to demonstrate value and engage through experiential means to woo younger customers and maintain customer loyalty, particularly in light of the challenging retail climate."_line_This shift toward more brand site usage has implications for business owners. Business owners can't rely on retailers alone to sell the product. In an age where consumers do a lot of research on the items they want to buy, it's necessary for a brand's website to be as effective as a salesperson at a store._line_This means that business owners can't skimp when it comes to developing their brand's website. It's not enough to provide basic information. People who are coming to the brand site will have detailed questions and they will have higher expectations for the information given. Afterall, if the brand's website can't answer the question they have, who can?_line_There are a few ways for a brand to make their website more useful to Consumers. For example, a frequently asked questions section is always useful. Live chat is a popular way to provide customer service to Consumers at the brand site. And make sure that commonly searched information such as price size reviews Etc are all easy to find on the website._line_Producing a higher quality brand site can benefit the business in multiple ways.

VPhoto: 123rf_line_Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most common mental health issues faced by Singaporeans, according to a study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health in 2010. In fact, one in 33 Singaporeans are affected by OCD in their lifetime. People with OCD tend to fear contamination and diseases. They also suffer from irrational fears and feel a need for routines, symmetry and patterns._line_Unfortunately, OCD is often dismissed as a personality quirk when, in fact, it is a severely debilitating illness, marked by obsessions \u2013 unwanted, persistent urges that trigger intense distress. Dr Jeanie Chu, Clinical Psychologist at The Resilienz Clinic, adds that it\u2019s especially important to realise that obsessions aren\u2019t always physical, such as cleaning rituals or setting things in perfect order. Instead, they can be \u201cthoughts zipping through the mind, which we cannot see\u201d._line_OCD causes the mind to revolve around certain themes, with the dread of contamination and disease taking top spot. Irrational fears of harm \u2013 \u201cdid I switch the stove off?\u201d \u2013 are another. An urgent need for symmetry and patterns is famously documented in the life of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, who uses repetitive visuals to \u201cobliterate\u201d the hallucinations in her head._line_Photo: 123rf_line_Yayoi Kasuma\u2019s famed art is an outlet for her OCD._line_When does a seemingly innocent habit of double checking things (did you send that text to the right person?) become an indicator of OCD? Frances Yeo, Consultant Psychologist at Thomson Medical Centre says the difference is that with normal day-to-day habits, \u201c\u2026people do not feel anxious once they\u2019re completed. Compulsions, however, are repetitive behaviours that arise to get rid of said obsessions or to reduce anxiety.\u201d_line_Personal story:_line_For 10 years, starting in her late 20s, Charlotte* refrained from going out whenever possible. Each time she left the house, she would feel \u201ccontaminated\u201d and the need to wipe down the house on her return. This would take at least seven hours. Her family would obey her OCD requests \u2013 walking where she said they could, or washing their hair at her request. But says Dr Jeanie, \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that engaging in compulsive actions on behalf of the sufferers creates a co-dependent relationship, which fuels the obsessive compulsive disorder.\u201d_line_Charlotte had to take baby steps to conquer OCD. She practised leaving the house or going out with her mother, and while she sometimes still feels \u201cdirty\u201d from being outside, she also feels empowered. She now works part-time at a jewellery shop and volunteers as a Peer Support Specialist at IMH._line_If you suspect a friend could be suffering, here are a few things you can do: Listen closely to their feelings and try not to give solutions.

V Hyderabad: Premier industry and trade body Ficci secretary general Sanjaya Baru on Monday said that the Union government must work with state governments to restore a sense of confidence among domestic investors to boost private investments in the country. Baru, who was also the media advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, pointed out that the private sector is not investing adequately due to lack of confidence and a sense of "insecurity". "The decrease in investment rate in the country from 35% to 29% is largely on account of decline in private investments...for several reasons...one of them being that many of the large firms are over-leveraged. It is extremely important for the government to come out and say that when a businessman makes a mistake, it can be a genuine honest mistake ... every mistake is not a product of dishonesty. There are criminal businessmen, they loot banks and siphon money out of India. Arrest them... arrest Vijay Mallya but every businessman, who has made a wrong investment is not a criminal... After all investment is an act of risk taking," Baru said while delivering a talk on 'Current State of Economic Affairs' at Ftapcci here. He also added that though the country has moved away from licence raj, it has moved towards 'regulation raj', wherein excessive regulations are causing a lot of inconvenience. Businessmen are more comfortable investing outside India or holding back investments as they are not confident about the future of their investments in the country, he said. He said to restore confidence the need of the hour is change of mind-set, especially in the government, where they start seeing the business community as nation builders and not view them with suspicion. Baru was quick to add that unless the investors within the country do not invest in the country, it will be difficult to convince foreign investors to pump money into India. Another major issue, Baru said was that whatever little investments are flowing in the country are coming to states such as Gujarat, NCR, AP and Telangana, which are already developed and no one is willing to invest in areas like North East, Odisha, West Bengal or Bihar, which actually need investments. _line_Bookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. _line_

VThis new way of looking at cells is revolutionizing biochemistry._line_Before the invention of cryo-electron microscopy, which won biochemists Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday, scientists had to stain or fix cells before they looked at them under an electron microscope. That process often caused fragile biological structures to fall apart, and if they didn\u2019t, the radiation from the electron microscope or the vacuum the scientists put the cells into often turned the once-living specimens into mush. Cryo-electron therapy allows scientists to look at the cells as if they were in their natural liquid environment\u2014just like they are in our bodies._line_\u201cIn order to really understand how these proteins work and function, looking at their state in a liquid environment is critical,\u201d says Allison Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society._line_In 1975, Joachim Frank of the New York State Department of Health theorized a process in which the then-limited information that electron microscopes presented could be combined into a high resolution, 3-D image. He spent more than a decade creating algorithms for this software, which then made cryo-electron microscopy possible._line_Then in 1984, a team led by Jacques Dubochet published a paper using electron microscopy to image a virus that often causes the common cold, preserved in a thin layer of water cooled so quickly it became more like glass than ice. "The viral particles appear free from the kind of damage caused by dehydration, freezing or adsorption to a support that is encountered in preparing biological samples for conventional electron microscopy," writes the scientific team in the paper. "Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens offers possibilities for high resolution observations that compare favorably with any other electron microscopical method." In 1990, Richard Henderson published the first picture of a bacterial protein with high enough resolution to show every individual atom._line_Since then, scientists have used cry-electron microscopy to look at more than 100 molecules: the proteins that cause chili peppers to burn your mouth, Zika cells, the plaques associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to name just a few. Getting a more accurate and higher resolution image of these proteins will help scientists develop new drugs and other therapies to fight the diseases they cause. \u201cI wish that we would have had this when I was still active in research,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cThe potential has yet to be realized.\u201d_line_

Material share of such benefits have been realized by CTOs against 8-10% cost savings potential as per our analysis prior to the DFC. With DFC being some years away, the interim margin trajectory would show volatility based on the potential drop in road freight pricing, uptick in exim trade and reduction in exim imbalance (all external factors of which one is playing in favor and two against as things stand today). We note recent buoyancy in business for rail volumes (up 12% yoy in August 2017), in line with the buoyancy in non-oil non-gems and jewellery exports (up 15% in August 2017). Such growth would be reflected even more in September 2017 rail container data before the real test comes from October 2017. Refer to the note for more details on near-term variables at play._line_VRL Logistics \u2013 A key beneficiary of a compliant system of transportation of domestic cargo_line_GST will lead to a shift of cargo movement to tax-compliant large-fleet operators. Coupled with improved productivity of commercial vehicles under GST, this would further increase the delta for organized players. Within the ecosystem, VRL Logistics stands out, having invested in cost overheads (hub-and-spoke network, large driver and owned CV base) to build a pan-India distribution network. Unlike other organized peers, it has done so without straining its balance sheet and is well-placed to gain market share from non-tax compliant small-fleet operators._line_E-way bill: a simple yet stringent approach to accounting in GST regime _line_All transactions on movement of manufactured goods beyond `50,000 in value would be required to raise an e- way bill on GST- Network (GSTN). This e-way bill would be initiated by a supplier/transporter/trader and will have to be verified by the receiver of such goods. Once the GSTN receives the e-way bill, it will generate an e- way bill number (EBN) and this will be provided to all related parties. This number will be valid for one day for a 100-km journey and one day each for each additional 100 km. The present lax system of checking enables unscrupulous consignors and transport agents/ common carriers to under-report transactions. This leads to mass tax avoidance, a business model for several manufacturers and transporters. The proposed draft rules tend to reduce leeway on this count markedly, in addition, the matching principle is at the heart of the GST system._line_For More Kotak Securities Ltd Disclaimer http://www.kotaksecurities.com/pdf/generaldisclosure.pdf _line_Above views are of the author and not of the website kindly read disclaimer_line_

VCars steal the spotlight when it comes to electrification, but the motorcycle industry is undergoing a similar transformation. The gradual shifts towards zero emissions look a lot alike -- some actors are well ahead of the curve and pioneering a new niche in their respective segments, while others are unwillingly hopping on the bandwagon to keep up with the rest of the industry._line_Can\u2019t name an electric motorcycle? Don\u2019t worry, there aren\u2019t many options to choose from right now. That\u2019s set to change soon when major manufacturers like Harley-Davidson, KTM, Yamaha, and Honda come to the market with their own spin on the concept. Until then, here are the best electric motorcycles currently on sale in the United States._line_Alta Redshift MX_line_Alta explains the Redshift MX is the electric equivalent of a 250cc dirt bike. The 261-pound machine offers 40 horsepower and 120 pound-feet of torque from a compact, water-cooled electric motor. A water-proof lithium-ion battery pack provides enough electricity for up to two hours of riding, and the Redshift never needs an oil change. Pricing starts at $14,995._line_Alta Redshift SM_line_The Alta Redshift SM is to the track what the Redshift MX is to the trail. Both use the same 40-hp electric motor linked to a 5.8-kWh battery pack, but the SM is equipped with lights and turn signals so it can be driven on the street. It has just 60 miles of range when it\u2019s used as a commuter, 40 miles of range when the pace picks up on a twisty road, and it can go flat-out for up to 20 minutes on a track. It retails for $15,495._line_Brutus 2 Café_line_The Café option turns the Brutus 2 into a head-turning café racer. The list of modifications includes down-turned handle bars, adjustable rear seats, and a stripped-down chassis that gives the bike the naked look that has historically characterized café racers. It\u2019s equipped with a 10-kWh battery pack, but Brutus hasn\u2019t published additional specifications such as range and output. Pricing is available upon request._line_Brutus V9_line_While Harley-Davidson is busily working on building an electric motorcycle, the model is still a couple of years away from cruising down the boulevard. If that\u2019s the style you\u2019re after, Brutus has you covered with the 125-hp V9. The company advertises performance and acceleration that will make any sports car green with envy, though more specific details (such as pricing) haven\u2019t been released yet. That's a tall order -- the fastest cars in the world are truly impressive._line_Energica Ego45_line_The 136-hp Energica Ego45 is for riders who want a touch of luxury with their performance. Think of it as a two-wheeled Lamborghini, except it's electric. It stands out with top-of-the-line components (including some that are 3D-printed), as well as design elements borrowed from the worlds of aerospace and racing. Act fast if you want one -- production is strictly limited to just 45 examples. Buyers can work directly with Energica to create a custom, one-of-a-kind bike, and they can even pick it up directly from the factory in Italy._line_Energica Eva_line_Energica brought together big names in racing to develop its lineup of performance-oriented electric bikes. Manufactured in Italy, the land of Ducati, the Eva is the most basic model in the Energica catalog. Underneath the muscular design hides a 95-hp motor with up to 120 miles of range when Eco mode is turned on. An 85-percent charge is available in just half an hour when the bike is plugged into a quick charger, so range anxiety becomes less of a worry._line_Lightning LS-218_line_Lightning doesn\u2019t beat around the bush -- you know its bikes are electric as soon as you read its name. Instead of catering to commuters or casual riders, the company aimed the LS-218 directly at the top of the electric bike segment. It became the fastest battery-powered motorcycle when it reached 215 mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 2011._line_Its specifications sheet is equally impressive. It gets a 200-hp, 168-lb-ft. powertrain with up to 180 miles of range. Brembo brakes keep the power in check. This is a full-blown superbike designed to race, as reflected by its asking price of nearly $40,000._line_Sora by Lito_line_The Sora by Lito hails from the land of poutine -- Quebec. Built entirely by hand, it turns heads with a design that\u2019s as original as it is sharp. The bodywork is crafted out of carbon fiber to help offset the weight added by the bulky lithium-ion battery pack, and the bike is capable of hitting 60 mph from a stop in four seconds flat. The downside is its Porsche-like $104,000 price tag; that puts it in the same ballpark as a lot of highly desirable two- and four-wheeled machines._line_Zero S_line_In many ways, Zero is the Tesla of the electric motorcycle industry. The California-based company has the technology figured out better than most of its rivals, so it offers a comprehensive range of products for all experience levels. Named S, its entry-level model is an urban bike that\u2019s nimble and practical._line_In its top configuration, the Zero S offers 60 hp, 81 lb-ft, and up to 153 miles of range when it\u2019s ridden in a mix of city and highway conditions. Pricing varies between $10,995 and $16,690._line_Zero DSR_line_The DSR is Zero\u2019s dual-sport model. Based on the DS, the R designation signifies it receives an electric motor dialed up to 116 lb-ft, a custom-tuned suspension, and a Bosch ABS system for extra peace of mind. It boasts up to 138 miles of range in a combined cycle, which is plenty for on- and off-road adventures. The Zero DSR starts at $18,690._line_

V35yr old Rishi Kurne fromKalamboli, Navi Mumbai had lost the thumb of his right hand, while working on a machine. _line_In April 2017 a 35yr old Rishi Kurne fromKalamboli, Navi Mumbai had lost the thumb of his right hand, while working on a machine at the factory where he is employed. His thumb got trapped and amputated. He consulted Dr Vinod Vij, Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeonat Hiranandani Hospital Vashi-A Fortis Network Hospital. During the consultation, the doctor explained to him that his amputated thumb was crushed beyond repair and it was not re-plantable. A re-plantation surgery is only possible if the amputated part is not crushed, and in such cases the doctor finds the vessel and joins them under the microscope._line_As first line of treatment, Dr Vij he used his skin from the patient\u2019s abdomen for grafting the thumb, to provide immediate relief,but it continued to hamper his routine work as he could not operate machines or handle equipment.He continued to eat food with his left hand and took longer time to do tasks that he could have easily done otherwise. Understanding his challenges, Dr Vij suggested that the patient\u2019s toe, which is of the same anatomy, could be used to replace his thumb. After explaining the process to the patient and garnering consent, the doctor went ahead with the replacement surgery in June 2017. This was a very rare procedure where the toe was used to replace the thumb through a micro-surgical process that could pose complications. Dr Vij\u2019stechnical expertise in conducting this procedure, enriched the patient with a fully functional hand. It took about six hours to conduct the surgery. Read here Lifesaving heart transplants conducted on two mumbaikars within 4 hours by surgeons at Fortis Hospital, Mulund_line_It was a very difficult phase for the patient as he struggled with his everyday chores and work was hampered, using his left hand did not help much. Since this is a surgery where the patient loses their toe, it is difficult to convince the patient and their family members to consent for the procedure. However, the Kurne family stood with Rishi\u2019s decision of going ahead with this surgery._line_Speaking about the procedure DrVinod Vij, Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeon, Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi-A Fortis Network Hospital,said, \u201cThis is a very rare procedure in which we effectively secured all veins and arteries of the patients hand and the surgery was a success. After one month of the surgery, the patient was able to eat with his right hand and is also was able to hold things. He was discharged within five days of the procedure and he has now resumed work where he is efficiently handling the machinery\u201d. _line_Supporting a family of five, the sole breadwinner of the family now continues to go about his daily chores without hindrance._line_

VKarma Yatri Travel and Art (KYTA), a residency programme, aims to explore and work on the possible relationships between travel, living, culture, art and expression by bringing together artists from different fields._line_About KYTA_line_At KYTA\u2019s residency programme, practising artists of different specialisations come from around the world to collaborate towards a single work of art. The artists for the programme are identified by KYTA through recommendations, mostly from the past residents. The project is completed during the period of the residency; the theme and framework for their project is decided by the artists in unison._line_KYTA was started by Shazeb Shaikh (33) and Hashim Qayoom (37) in 2014. \u201cThe idea is to see how different disciplines can work together to create something of value,\u201d says Shazeb, who works with a 35-member-strong advertising agency called Sparkt in Mumbai. Shazeb has been making films and dabbling with a creative career since he was 21. Hashim is also the founder of Karma Yatri, an experimental travel company that organises bike expeditions across India._line_Hashim had travelled to Kalga, a small village in Himachal Pradesh, often. The beauty of this Himalayan village, the simple and traditional lifestyle of its people, made him imagine it as the place which could inspire the creation of a collaborative artwork. That\u2019s how KYTA was born in 2014, six months after it was conceptualised. While artists work together on a single project, the programme also gives them the opportunity to conduct workshops, wherein they can share with other artists their experiences and learnings._line_Kalga-5 (2014-2018) is the current residency programme to which KYTA is committed for five years. At the end of Kalga-5, the team will hand over the project to the Kalga village, having made an attempt to bring out a unique perspective of Kalga in the finished artwork._line_An experimental programme_line_Initially, the founders of KYTA wanted to hold the residency in different locations each year of the programme. This perception changed as they discovered how the pristine beauty of Kalga inspired artistic creation. Due to the experimental nature of this project, KYTA\u2019s vision has changed since 2016. \u201cWe changed our project\u2019s focus from the residency to the village. This meant that the artwork produced in the village would stay in the village, the inspiration for which could come from outside or within the village,\u201d says Shazeb. This year, for the first time, all the artwork will be exhibited in Kalga itself._line_A peculiar feature of Kalga is that it does not have a community that the artists can engage with. The village contains within itself a total number of 35 houses, out of which only three to four houses are occupied throughout the year. The unoccupied houses are converted into homestays. \u201cThis makes it easier for us to approach the residents and tell them about what we do and install our artwork in some of these houses,\u201d says Shazeb._line_In 2016, KYTA set up Karma Studio in Kalga in collaboration with Studio Karva of Mumbai. This studio acts as a basic facility where potters and sculptors, local or from outside, can work. The clay used for these activities is mined out from the vicinity. A sound and music studio for producing and listening to music is in the process of being set up. They also envision setting up a library for which books will be sourced from all over the world. \u201cPeople will be asked to donate books from any field, so long as they are unique in nature,\u201d says Shazeb._line_The present and past editions_line_In 2014, 10 artists worked on a short experimental film called, aLpha. In 2015, 11 artists attended the residency as part of a bilateral exchange between France and India. They made a feature-length film from scratch within six weeks. None of these artists had previous knowledge of filmmaking. The film, Inedie, was released in 2017._line_KYTA gets its funding from the Swiss Arts Council and Karma Yatri.

VIf someone were to ask me to describe Madrid in one word, I'd have no hesitation. Simply put, this city is alive. Yes, it boasts exuberant charm and delight just like any other European destination, but what sets Madrid apart is how it thoughtfully threads together passion and culture in the fabric of daily life. Community makes up the warm soul of this city, and no matter how long you stay, it won't take long before you feel a part of it. _line_So if you're looking to experience Madrid and marvel at the contagious energy it radiates, I say go for it. Book that flight and pack your bags. Don't worry about your itinerary, as that's all covered ahead. Tackling everything from accommodations to eateries and must-see attractions, your ultimate travel guide awaits!_line_ First Things First: Tackling Where to Stay! _line_When booking your home away from home, I highly recommend this charming loft via Airbnb. For starters, this quaint apartment couldn't have a more phenomenal location. It's close to so many attractions, yet because it's tucked away off a quiet street, it still radiates those desirable off-the-beaten-path vibes. Plus, at $61 per night, you can sleep soundly knowing this place isn't eating right through your travel budget. Image Source: Airbnb_line_ Next Up: Tackling Where to Eat! _line_Another reason to stay at that specific Airbnb? It's right around the corner from the cozy coffee shop known as Martina Cocina. I kid you not, my husband and I ended up eating at this eatery about four times during our visit. This place was just that good. With scrumptious lunch, dinner, and dessert options \u2014 don't even get me started on the coffee \u2014 we simply couldn't get enough. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_After about one or two meals, I quickly realized Madrid is not only home to an abundance of delicious food. No, this corner of Spain takes the festivities of eating to a whole new level. See, when it comes to the culinary scene here, it's all about serving up an unforgettable experience. Take, for instance, Boho Bar, which is pictured above. Forget about mediocre seating when you come to this restaurant. Here, you can mingle and wait for your food as you lounge in swings. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_And if you thought that was cool, just wait. The interior decor is even more eclectic at Ojala. While this might appear to be an average restaurant when your first walk in, head straight downstairs. That assumption will quickly melt away once you feast your eyes on the neon lights and sandpit lounge. Did I mention this place has amazing smoothies? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Yes, it won't take long before you realize this city is practically a gold mine of mouthwatering food. My advice? Just eat and indulge in it all. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_If your taste buds are craving something sweet, head straight to La Bicicleta Cafe, where you will find an excellent assortment of homemade cakes and pastries. Plus, this cozy cafe has an incredibly laid-back atmosphere, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind for a bit. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_If you're as much of a carb fanatic as I am, let me just say a delicious carb-fest will be waiting upon your arrival. No matter which neighborhood you wander, you will most likely find mountains of carbs resting patiently behind glass windows on every corner. I know, I know \u2014 true bliss! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_And if salty chips are more of your cup of tea, well, you're in luck, because there's no shortage of them here! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_If your stomach starts screaming for salads after all the carbs and salty foods, don't worry; I've got your upcoming health kick covered. For starters, El Huerto de Lucas serves awesome organic dishes full of delicious spices and flavors. Another great option is Rayen Vegano, which offers a spectacular vegan menu. Last but certainly not least is El Jardin Secreto de Salvador Bachiller. This tea garden is located on the fourth-floor terrace of a department store and is pretty much a hidden gem. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_How could I forget to mention the Mercado de San Miguel? While this covered food hall can be quite touristy, I highly recommend checking it out. Originally built in 1916, the San Miguel Market is the most popular market in all of Madrid. And with over 30 different vendors selling a dizzying array of freshly prepared food, there's something for everyone. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_From tapas, meats, cheese, and olives to international beer, wine, and Champagne, this is one place you need to come with a big appetite. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_With foods and flavors from all around the globe, there is no doubt a visit to the San Miguel Market will awaken all of your senses. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_And the best part? Because the foods are served in smaller-size portions, you can sample just about everything! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Even the servings of ice cream are teeny-tiny. I mean, have you ever seen a cone that small? No guilt here with that bite. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_I don't think I've ever sampled so much goodness in one place as I did here at this bustling market. As you can imagine, the best decision of the night was opting to wear elastic-waist yoga pants. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_ Tackling What to Do, See, and Explore _line_As with the dynamic culinary scene, you won't have to be on Madrid soil for long before you realize there is so much to see, do, and explore in this city. No matter which neighborhood you decide to discover first, you'll be guaranteed an exhilarating experience. One area in particular not to miss is the Paseo del Prado. This district is home to beautiful sights such as the San Jeronimo el Real, a breathtaking 16th-century Roman Catholic cathedral situated atop a hill, as well as the Prado Museum, which is the main Spanish national art museum. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_One of my favorite activities while exploring Madrid was freely roaming and wandering my way around. It was during this time I stumbled upon some of the simplest \u2014 yet most beautiful \u2014 moments. Whether it was strolling past a random floral vendor arranging a stunning bouquet or looking down at the uneven cobblestone streets and thinking about all the many steps that took place before my years, there was tremendous beauty to embrace all over. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Although I am by nature a fast walker \u2014 who knows, maybe it's from those years of living in New York City \u2014 I forced myself to slow my pace down and simply observe throughout my time in Madrid. While beauty was overflowing the streets, I also had to remind myself to look up, as each building seemed to be an architectural masterpiece. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_My wandering eventually led me to the world-renowned Plaza Mayor. Although this is another attraction that can be a bit touristy, I recommend swinging by. This iconic plaza left me speechless. I did go earlier in the morning to avoid the clusters of crowds, but I've read this spot is even more sublime at night. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_See what I mean about every street exploding with charm? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Just as any other city, there were times where the main streets did tend to transform into quite the game of elbow pushing. But what makes Madrid unique is that once you veer off from the crowds and walk down a narrow alleyway, you are then greeted with peaceful plazas that infuse a special sensation of serenity back into your veins. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_While I can't pinpoint the exact reason, something about this city continuously brought forth an ear-to-ear grin on my face. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_But the more I think about it, the more I realize I fell in love with this city because of the people. With each new resident I met and struck up conversation with, I felt more and more embraced and welcomed. Everyone was extremely approachable and inviting, which spoke highly of the city's warm, vibrant culture. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Another thing I appreciated about Madrid was the communal vibes. People were out and about, soaking in the sunshine while enjoying the company of others. As silly as it might sound, I recognized this as a reminder to put away my phone and simply relish the present moment at hand. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Then there was the laid-back atmosphere. It was quite infectious, which I didn't mind one bit. In fact, I tried to bottle up this feeling for when I returned home. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Oh, and don't be surprised if you turn the corner and suddenly come across live music. No matter the time or place, this seemed to happen each day my husband and I were exploring, and I loved each and every encounter. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Now, if you love flea markets, thrift stores, and antique shops, make sure to leave some space in your luggage, because they are everywhere in Madrid. Seriously, everywhere! And each one is teeming with unique treasure. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_If you happen to be in the city on Sunday, be sure to check out El Rastro de Madrid aka the largest flea market in all of Spain. I'll admit, I've experienced my fair share of flea markets, but I had never encountered anything like this. Hundreds of vendors lined the streets, selling anything and everything you can imagine. It was awesome! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_You really will have no idea what you might stumble upon next. But trust me, it's an unforgettable experience to take part in and will leave you with tons of decor inspiration! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_And the best part? (OK, one of the best parts.) You can find beautiful local artwork at amazing prices. So if you're looking for a place to find souvenirs, this is it! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Yet if your trip doesn't happen to fall on a Sunday, no worries! Madrid has tons of other eclectic shops to browse your way through. From books and collectibles to vintage clothing and retro finds, this city truly has it all. One bookstore in particular to check out is Panta Rhei. This shop has an amazing selection of graphic design and illustration books and carries options from both large and small independent publishers. Plus, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_If you want to see the city from a bird's eye view, hop aboard the Teleferico de Madrid. This cable car was originally built as part of the Parque de Atracciones amusement park, but now takes you over the River Manzanares and into the Casa de Campo park. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Once you arrive to the other side, you'll be greeted with sweeping panoramic views of the city, and you will now be in the largest park of Madrid. With over 4,000 acres to explore, this is a great place to marvel in the fresh air and reconnect with nature. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Another must-see attraction is the Arganzuela Footbridge. Uniting the two banks of the Manzanares River, this spiraling and conical bridge is dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists. Originally built to improve the urban connections between the north and south neighborhoods of Madrid, this footbridge has quickly become an iconic landmark within the city. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Looking to feast your eyes on a beautiful, historic palace? If so, head over to the Sabatini Gardens. Located on the north side of the Royal Palace, these neoclassical-style gardens not only offer magnificent views, but exploring this area is also free! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Plus, there are quite a few peacocks on the premises that are eager to show off! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Yearning for even more serenity? Head over to El Retiro Park. Also known as the "the green lungs of the city," this oasis is home to over 15,000 trees and over 300 acres. As you can imagine, there is an abundance of space to sit back, relax, and rest a while. Or, in my case, eat an entire crate of strawberries . . . Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_In the heart of the park lies the Retiro Park Lake, which is a popular spot for both locals and travelers alike. It is here you can indulge in a little sunbathing and even rent a rowboat if you're looking to get out on the calming water. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Another can't-miss attraction in the park is the Palacio de Cristal. This palace was originally built in 1887 and is made almost entirely of glass and metal. In other words, it is absolutely breathtaking. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_Did I mention it's free to explore? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_So at the end of the day, no matter where your curiosity leads you to in Madrid, I know one thing for certain: you'll have an incredible adventure. And if your journey is anything like mine, you'll leave as a different person than you were when you arrived. Happy travels! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb_line_

VIt's virtually impossible._line_A perennial topic of science fiction, researchers stumbled upon the answer to the question of whether or not we're secretly living inside of a computer._line_From Star Trek: The Next Generation\u2019s "Ship in a Bottle" episode, to the eponymously named computer system in the movie The Matrix, the idea that life is little more than a computer simulation has served as a sci-fi standby for generations. But that technological twist on the idea that life might just be a dream can\u2019t possibly be true. Right?_line_Well, what if it is? What if this life is just a simulation of the real thing? What if you, in an incredibly meta act, are reading this on a computer while residing inside of a computer? Once inserted, the thought niggles away at us\u2014we can\u2019t think our way out of this quagmire. \u201cWhat if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?\u201d asks Morpheus in The Matrix. Dude._line_But now researchers say they've sussed out the whole situation for us. Theoretical physicists Zohar Ringel and Dmitry Korvizhini, who are based at Racah Institute of Physics Hebrew University in Israel and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, claim to prove the concreteness of our reality in a recent Scientific Advances study._line_To understand what they found, it helps to first recognize what a computer is: it's essentially a machine that performs calculations. In order for a computer to simulate reality, then, the machine would need to have enough power to actually create the phenomena that we experience within its simulated environment. What the researchers discovered, however, is that storing the information required to simulate certain behaviors of even a couple hundred electrons would take more atoms than exist in the universe. For better or for worse, this world is real. Probably._line_The researchers didn\u2019t set out to disprove the central plot of your favorite Doctor Who episode. That was an accident. Kovrizhi and Ringel were trying to see if they could use a mathematical method to model systems that display anomalies (the stuff that always gets Star Trek ships into trouble) like those of the quantum Hall effect. The regular Hall effect (normally just called the Hall effect) explains how, under the right circumstances, metals can display some interesting electrical behaviors. For example, if you take a a metal bar and send a current flowing through it, you expect electrons to keep moving straight ahead in the direction of the current. But when you apply a magnetic field perpendicularly to the current, the Hall effect predicts that the electrons will turn and start moving perpendicularly to both the current\u2019s original direction and the magnetic field. The quantum Hall effect takes the standard Hall even further: when you take conductive material into an environment that\u2019s both very cold (near Absolute Zero, or -459.67 F), and has a strong magnetic field, particles behave even more oddly. Kovrizhi and Ringel were trying to get a better grasp on why._line_Two plus two is pretty easy to solve (the answer, in case you\u2019re wondering, is four). These sorts of equations are fine for relatively simple systems\u2014we can do them with a calculator, if not in our minds. But these kinds of easy calculations start to break down when dealing with the weird quantum behavior that occurs at the very very small (we\u2019re talking about systems smaller than the goings on of individual atoms) level. There are more unknowns\u2014and you can have an infinite number of particles interacting. That\u2019s what is known as the many body problem._line_\u201cWhen you do physics and you don\u2019t know how to solve something, you say, maybe I can just have my computer solve it for me and that will give me some intuition,\u201d Ringel told Popular Science. So he and his colleague turned to quantum Monte Carlo, a family of computational methods that use random sampling to study complex quantum systems that can\u2019t be solved directly. But the researchers discovered that for every particle they added to the system, the simulation became exponentially more complex. It essentially doubled in complexity with each new particle (not unlike the reproductive rate of a tribble), making the problem unresolvable._line_It's not that people hadn't attempted to solve for quantum Hall before. People have tried solving it using laptops, and big clusters of computers. Ringel and Kovirzhi didn't necessarily expect to succeed, but they hoped to figure out why it had never been done. It could be that humans aren't smart enough, or that physicists just haven't yet found the right mathematical mapping. The new study makes it clear that it's just not possible to simulate the effect. And to the study authors, that suggests it would be impossible for a computer to create our world._line_"If you see a phenomena that can't be simulated by a classical computer, that means we can\u2019t be part of a huge classical computer that is simulated while someone steals our energy, for example," says Ringel. In other words: no Matrix scenario._line_There are of course, some caveats._line_In the Matrix, the trick to bending the spoon is to realize there is no spoon. Unfortunately, your spoons are probably real._line_First, this presumes that the physical laws of the universe in which our not-so-benevolent overlords are operating mirror those found within the simulated fortress we call home. That might seem like a big presumption. But ask any special effects crew; it's really hard to build a world, and even harder to have it make physical sense. The route of least resistance would be to model a fake world after the real thing._line_The study also assumes that any potential puppet masters are using computers as we know them. "If they somehow know how to run quantum computers, that completely dissolves our claims," says Ringel. Classical computers, like the kind you're probably reading this on, treat electrons as particles. Quantum computers treat electrons as probabilities that are best conceived of as waves\u2014the electron isn't in one place but in many places at the same time. "Quantum computers can solve certain problems that regular computers can't," says Ringel. "You can factor very large numbers and break all of the standard encryption techniques that we have today. But nobody has ever built a quantum computer and shown that it does that." Or nobody inside our reality, anyway._line_This isn\u2019t the only quantum interaction for which predictive algorithms haven\u2019t yet been found. This paper suggests that they may never be uncovered, putting a kibosh on the idea that reality could be an elaborate game of The Sims. Absent a fundamental reworking of our universe, the world is probably the real world. Unless, of course, it\u2019s just a dream._line_

VEmployer branding is taking the recruiting industry by storm. Make sure your organization isn't missing the boat by failing to provide the "right" information. _line_CREDIT: Getty Images_line_In today's market place, to attract and hire top talent, recruiters must act like marketers. Rather than differentiating a product or service, recruiters have to position their organizations as top employers. This process is known as employer branding._line_How impactful is it? According to iCims, a software solutions provider to the talent acquisition industry, 94 percent of candidates are likely to apply to a job if a company actively manages its employer brand. On the flip side, LinkedIn found that not knowing what it's like to work for an organization is the number one obstacle that candidates face during the application process._line_In a nutshell, employer branding connects who your organization is to what it does._line_One of the best ways to spread the word, per Phil Strazzulla, CEO and founder of NextWave Hire, a startup that specializes in employer branding, is "to create lots of in-depth content that candidates care about."_line_That makes sense, but where do you start? Luckily, through a 2016 LinkedIn Global Trends report, we have five pieces of direct advice from candidates on what to share about our companies and prospective roles:_line_1. Give an honest perspective._line_Recruiters' knee-jerk reactions are to highlight the awe-inspiring and overwhelmingly positive experiences. In reality, everyone knows that those instances are few and far between._line_Instead, provide a real-life picture of what it's like to work inside your environment. Doing so will increase the chances that you not only hire the "right" person for the role, but also for your culture._line_2. Share employee views._line_Although primed and proper presentations from the company's executives bode well with shareholders and customers, prospective employees actually want to hear directly from the staff member's perspectives. Yes, this also means the negative aspect of the job as well._line_Disclosing some of the current frustrations ensures that recruiters don't set false expectations and over-promise and under-deliver._line_3. Explain what makes you different._line_Work is work. From a job description standpoint, "accountants" can be "accountants" anywhere. Rather than marketing the role itself, make sure to highlight examples of why your organization is different from others._line_Whether it's a collaborative environment, having access to coaching and mentoring, or an onsite gym that sets you apart, prospective employees want a better understanding of what life will be like._line_4. Clarify the vision and strategy._line_It's tough to gain a true understanding of an organization's vision through headlines alone. Having an executive delve deeper into your mission will help recruits better connect what your organizations does with why they do it._line_5. Be open about retention._line_Also known as: Be honest about why this position is open. Whether newly created or open due to voluntary turnover, people appreciate transparency. As a recruiter, this piece of advice terrifies me._line_Although you can't disclose everything, painting an accurate representation of the position and expectations is critical to the new employee's success -- and candidates know it. Set them up for success by being as up front as possible._line_A few of these suggestions may feel uncomfortable to discuss. However, their effectiveness is undeniable. Through Strazzulla's research, focusing on employer branding can significantly decrease your cost per hire, increase the likelihood that career site visits turn into applications, and double the amount of job applicants._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_

VWhether it\u2019s floating clocks or hovering smartphone chargers, levitation is hot right now. That's why we\u2019re totally hyped at the prospect of some fascinating research coming out of the Sussex Computer Human interaction (SCHI) Lab at the U.K.\u2019s University of Sussex, where engineers have figured out how to make a levitating food-delivery system, in which tasty grub floats straight into your mouth. No knife and fork required!_line_\u201cWe are interested in a way to deliver small quantities of food to a user without anyone touching the food,\u201d Sriram Subramanian, professor of Informatics at the University of Sussex, told Digital Trends. \u201cWe created a way to deliver food from a dropper to the user\u2019s mouth without touching anything. Food morsels are levitated using acoustic levitation techniques, and transported using our device to the user\u2019s mouth. This is an semi-automated process giving us digital control over what food is delivered to the user's mouth, when it is delivered, and how much is delivered.\u201d_line_So far, the TastyFloats technology has been used to levitate tiny droplets of wine, blue cheese, bread, lettuce, meat, bread, and raspberry grain. Interestingly, the droplets of food changed the way that the flavors were registered by users. In volunteer trials, sweet tastes were reported as being more intense and recognizable, while bitter tastes were much harder to recognize._line_\u201cOur biggest challenge in this work was to be able to control the levitation system so that food morsels are stable in the system, whether it is wine, meat, or cheese that we are levitating,\u201d Subramanian continued. \u201cIn other words, we needed to find a way to control the levitation energy so that it is strong enough to hold different density food items, but not so strong that they evaporate.\u201d_line_Subramanian suggested that the technology could be used to deliver a more complete multisensory experience to people experiencing virtual reality, television, or gaming. Imagine, for example, being in a virtual environment that not only looks real but tastes real, as well -- without you needing to do any more than open your mouth to achieve the intended effect._line_\u201cWhat we\u2019ve created [so far] is a first prototype that is somewhat cumbersome to use,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cIn the future, we want to make the delivery system more robust and easy to deploy. We would also look to try and create a short movie experience which incorporates our TastyFloats system to get an idea of how users experience it. Finally, we would love to work with content developers to create content that harnesses the potential of our device. While I can easily see a more refined version of our system becoming a real-world device, this is probably a few years away.\u201d_line_

VThe University Grants Commission (UGC) has come up with a unique idea to fix all that ails higher education in India. Or at least what it thinks is the biggest problem that afflicts the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and the Banaras Hindu University (BHU)._line_The statutory body, which is tasked with the coordination, determination and maintenance of standards of higher education, thinks that dropping "M" from AMU and "H" from BHU will help reflect the "secular character" of these prestigious institutions. What - or if at all - it does to the academic standards of universities is something the UGC has chosen not to answer._line_The suggestion, surprisingly, is contained in an audit of the AMU by a panel set up by the UGC on April 25 at the behest of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to probe complaints of irregularities against 10 central universities._line_The other universities that were audited by the UGC committees include Pondicherry University, Allahabad University, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand, Central University of Jharkhand, Central University of Rajasthan, Central University of Jammu, Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya in Wardha, University of Tripura and Hari Singh Gour University in Madhya Pradesh._line_The mandate of the five committees set up for the purpose was restricted to look into infrastructure, academic, research and financial operations._line_It is perhaps not so difficult to understand why a panel - tasked with assessing infrastructure - will get itself embroiled into debates as complicated as secular versus communal. Secular cleansing seems to be the order of the day. We are into an exercise of forming uniform identities, a nationalistic agenda that is raising its head with complete impunity and scant regard for India's historic cultural, religious and social ethos._line_At a time when the status of AMU's minority status is sub judice, it is politically expedient to speak in the same tone as that of the incumbent government which has backed an Allahabad High Court order denying the university a minority status. Of course, such a narrative can't differentiate between the minority status and secular character of an institution._line_We are into an exercise of forming uniform identities, a nationalistic agenda that is raising its head with complete impunity._line_Secular institutions ensure equality of treatment and opportunities for all their students, irrespective of their religious practices. Minority institutions seek a right to reserve their distinct religious identity without discriminating against any individual. It is only for the UGC to explain how a Muslim or Hindu in the name of an institution reflects that members of the other communities are being discriminated against or secularism being compromised._line_The fact that a statutory body tasked with ensuring high education standards in the country has chosen to indulge in a debate which is tearing apart the nation is a sad commentary on the state of affairs and an ominous sign for the days to come. It is sad UGC is drawing ridicule on social media for its misadventure._line_remove muslim from AMU, hindu from BHU. i do want to wake up to a national paper called 'The'.https://t.co/tTevEYibKv_line_ \u2014 Hartosh Singh Bal (@HartoshSinghBal) October 9, 2017 _line_State of education in India_line_Higher education in the country is ailing with problems such as low rate of enrolment, unequal access, poor quality of infrastructure and lack of relevance. The country has only about722 varsities, as against the National Knowledge Commission recommendation of 1,500. The gross enrolment rate (GER) in India was abysmally low at 24.5 per cent during 2015-16. There is no taking away from the fact that 24.5 percent during 2004-05 the GER for higher education in India was only 10 per cent. But for a country aspiring to be a global power, these numbers are dismal to say the least._line_Student to teacher ratios in most colleges and universities are low, but more distressing is the quality of the teachers that these institutions have._line_Meanwhile, private universities are mushrooming across the country. While everybody has a right to make profits in businesses, making a business out of education is tragic._line_Setting up of private universities requires enactments in the state assembly. This has resulted in a bizarre situation on the ground. In 2005, the Supreme Court struck down a law in the state of Chhattisgarh that recognised 112 private universities in one single year._line_Given the state of affairs, it does not need a genius to pinpoint where UGC's focus needs to be. It had an opportunity to fix things in some (if not all) universities, it has squandered it away by creating a controversy the country could have lived without._line_Names of institutions are spun in the history that develops to build them. They are symbols of the holistic identities that take ages to build. But names are also political tools - tools that create and negate legacies. The politics of name giving and name changing is also way of deflecting attention from solemn issues._line_At a time when UGC should be asking and answering questions about the research standards of our universities and colleges, about how our education is failing to match global standards, about why our students drop out simply because they can't cough up the fees, that the institution has chosen to answer questions on secularism is shocking. The UGC is perhaps oblivious to the fact that there are too many heads doing just that._line_It will be advisable for the UGC to bring its focus back to fixing academic issues._line_

To recreate this look, pair your bob with minimal makeup and orange-red lips._line_5. Wheat Blonde With Darkened Roots:_line_Image: Getty_line_Brittany Snow\u2019s tousled wheat blonde bob with darkened roots perfectly suits her elegant style and, impressively, it enhances out the colour in her blue eyes and that enviable skin. Snow\u2019s textured blonde bob haircut shows off her eye-catching hair color, and we love that her long bangs are swept to one side._line_6. Light Ash Blonde:_line_Image: Getty_line_Always on vogue, and in style, dancer Julianne Hough once again proves that a light ash blonde works well against a flawless skin tone and a coral make-up look. We adore her not too ash, not too golden asymmetrical shaggy bob that gives plenty of textured and movement. Picture-perfect._line_7. Dark Ash Blonde:_line_Image: Getty_line_The hairstyle colour of the season is dark ash blonde. Take inspiration from Anna Wintour, who looks gorgeous with her trademark pageboy bob. We love the perfect balance between her light and dark ash hues. And those bangs. They skim her cheekbones, accentuate her eyes and flatter her peachy skin._line_8. Champagne Blonde:_line_Image: Getty_line_We were assured at The Ninth Annual UNICEF Snowflake Ball that Journalist Katie Couric has perfected warm blonde hue. The champagne tone gives her hair an ethereal glow and the side-swept curls add oomph to her mid-length bob._line_9. Angled Bob In Caramel Highlights:_line_Image: Getty_line_Oh, Posh \u2013 angled, asymmetric, edgy, black or blonde; you can magically pull of anything when it comes to bob. At the 15th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards, the former Spice Girl flaunts her caramel highlights with a polished, angled bob that emphasises her brown eyes. For sleek hair like Victoria\u2019s, work some texturizing mousse into your locks and a flat iron, as well as some strong hold hairspray. Bravo! One can never go wrong with blonde angled bob hairstyles._line_10. Golden Wheat:_line_Image: Getty_line_Actress Reese Witherspoon has got golden wheat blonde hairstyle we\u2019ve been lusting over for many days now. A striking warm colour that can soften any complexion, Reese\u2019s has nailed the medium, curly bob._line_With endless shades of a blonde spectrum to choose from, we hope our list of ten blonde bob hairstyles will help you find the perfect hue for your locks.

V Are you drinking 8 glasses of water every day? If not, then now would be a good time to start. While not having sufficient water has many side-effects, it is equally important that we are mindful of 'how' this water is consumed. The principles of Ayurveda suggest that the way you choose to drink water also affects your overall health. Interesting, isn't it? Ancient Ayurveda has numerous theories regarding tips to drink water which have been followed over centuries. According to the book, The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies by Vasant Lad, water is the manifestation of consciousness. Water is fluid, heavy, soft, vicious, cold, dense and cohesive. It brings molecules together. Water is a chemical energy, which means it is a universal chemical solvent. Water exists in the body as plasma, cytoplasm, serum, saliva, nasal secretion, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and sweat. It is therefore necessary for absorption of nutrition and to maintain life; without it, our cells cannot survive. Considering how essential water is to human life, here are some handy yet important Ayurvedic tips to drink water._line_Ayurvedic Tips to Drink Water_line_1. Sit Down to Drink Water Rather than Standing_line_ It is a good idea to always sit and drink water rather than standing. By standing and drinking, you disrupt the balance of fluids in the body and this may lead to a greater accumulation of fluids in the joints causing arthritis. By sitting and drinking, your muscles and nervous system is much more relaxed and helps the nerves to digest food and other fluids easily. Your kidneys also pace the filtration process while sitting._line_By standing and drinking water, you disrupt the balance of fluids in the body_line_2. Avoid Chugging All the Water at Once_line_ Avoid gulping down large volumes of water in a single breath, rather take smaller sip, swallow, breathe and repeat throughout the day. This holds true while having your meals too. According to Ayurvedic expert, Dr. Akhilesh Sharma, "there are three doshas in the body - vata, pitta and kapha, and how you consume water must be in accordance with these doshas. People with vata prakruti should drink water only one hour after eating a meal. This will help their food digest in a better way. People with pitta prakruti can have small sips during meals to start their digestion process early and people with kapha prakurti should have water before taking meals so that they feel full and not eat more. This will help them lose weight easily."_line_Avoid gulping large volumes of water during meals and otherwise_line_3. Drink Room Temperature water, Warm is Even Better_line_ Avoid ice chilled water that disturbs the ongoing process of digestion and puts off the fire. Cold water decreases the blood supply to various organs of the body further leading to constipation. Drinking tepid water can help in proper digestion and metabolism that promotes weight loss, relieves bloating and pain. According to Dr. Akhilesh, warm water helps in in controlling cholesterol levels and also keep the arteries clean._line_Avoid drinking chilled water as it disrupts the process of digestion_line_4. Drink Only When You are Thirsty_line_ Your body sends signals to you when it is in dire need of water. Ayurveda emphasizes on drinking water only when you feel thirsty. Every person has a different body, hence, drinking the same amount of water cannot be recommended to everybody. The body cannot absorb too much water intake; therefore it is imperative to know the thirst cues your body gives you. Measure your own drinking system without feeling too full._line_Your body sends signals when it is in dire need of water_line_5. Know the Indicators your Body Gives You When You are Thirsty_line_ Your body gives you cues to let you know it needs water. One being, the color of urine, dark yellow color may indicate dehydration, while fairly clear and straw colored urine is a sign of a hydrated and satiated body. Dry chapped lips are one of the indicators of a dehydrated body. Notice these cues as these may turn into health problems._line_Know the indicators that your body give you when it needs water_line_6. Drink Water First Thing in the Morning_line_ Ayurveda suggests that is a healthy habit to drink water first thing in the morning, which is known as Ushapan. It helps get rid of many diseases in the body. Drinking water in the morning helps in flushing all the toxins in the body and cleanses your intestines._line_Start drinking water first thing in the morning_line_7. Drink Water Stored in Silver and Copper Vessels_line_ Ayurveda has always suggested drinking water stored in copper (tamba) and silver (chaandi) vessels. The water stored in these vessels has the ability to balance all three doshas in the body and it does by positively charging the water. Dr. Akhilesh agrees and points out that copper has numerous antioxidants and anti-bacterial properties that help boost the immunne system of the body. It also has anti-cancer properties. Water in the silver vessel has the power to remove free radicals from the body and gives a cooling effect in the intestines and smoothens the process of digestion._line_The water stored in copper and silver vessels helps cure all doshas in your body_line_Important Tips for Drinking Water in Summer_line_ According to Dr. Keerti Gupta from Kirti Ayurvedic Hospital & Research Center, "Summer is called as the "Pitta Season" and afternoon time is Pitta Kaal, which is hottest time of the day, therefore, Ayurveda suggests that you should drink maximum water during this period so as to maintain the body temperature. You could also incorporate some small changes including adding Pitta pacifying ingredients in water that help maintain body heat. Some of the ingredients include lemon, mint, kokum, and fennel seeds,khaskhas and rose petals._line_

VExactly how beauty enthusiasts follow a healthy CTM routine every day, similarly they have a monthly beauty plan as well. The to-dos of the monthly beauty plan are executed once in a month on the body and not more than that._line_The frequency of these monthly beauty care plans does not alter, except in case of special occasions._line_Men and women who abide by these monthly beauty care plans (other than their daily beauty program) live an improved and healthier life. Those who do not repeat these monthly beauty to-dos face gross bodily problems over time._line_So, here's the list of the most essential beauty care to-dos that you must try to cover every month, in order to maintain a good skin, hair and an overall you._line_Face Cleanup Or Facial_line_No matter how much you cleanse, moisturize or tone your skin, an extra layer of dirt still remains on the skin. Usual CTM cannot remove it. Over a span of a month, this clogged layer of dirt and dust increases on your skin and the worst hit part is the face. As the face is the most exposed, it gets maximum clogged and dusted. This is where comes the role of a face cleanup or facial that deep penetrates into your skin cells to clear off the stored dust and dirt particles. These open your skin pores, nourish them, also giving your skin a fresh look._line_Hair Spa_line_Now the way your face needs extra pampering once in a month, same is the case with your hair. Irrespective of the length, height or the texture of your hair, your scalp does get clogged with dust and dirt. Thus, a hair spa session, once in a month, clears off the hair scalp completely, encouraging new hair growth. Hair spa alters the texture and appearance of the hair._line_Pedicure And Manicure_line_In your monthly beauty care plan, a must-include addition is manicure and pedicure. These two pamper the most ignored parts of your body - palms and feet, respectively. You can do pedicure and manicure at home, only if you have all the right ingredients and you know how to do it. If you're unsure, please book a salon appointment, to do the monthly pedicure and manicure._line_Body Massage_line_A body massage is a must in your beauty plan every month. This adds a relieving quotient to your body and rejuvenates you for the month. For body massage, do appoint professionals and try opting for high-end natural or ayurvedic oils. Often, body massage follows with a sauna experience, which you should not miss out on._line_Threading And Other Hair Removal_line_In your monthly beauty care plan, threading and hair removal should be there. However, if your hair growth is less and you think you can manage without doing hair removal - then that's your call. For threading and hair removal on your body, only count on experts._line_Go For Beauty Shopping_line_Well, beauty experts suggest going for beauty shopping every month, atleast once, so that you can clear out all expired or non-beneficial cosmetics from your dressing table with the useful ones. Also, heading for beauty shopping every month will let you remain updated about the new cosmetics, offers and launches. Those who do not revamp their dressing table regularly, face greater beauty problems._line_

The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of the dengue virus, bites mostly during the day \u2013 which means unless you\u2019re in an air-conditioned cocoon without any ventilation, you are in danger of the pesky insects and the disease they carry._line_The coconut shell is just an example.

What sets it apart (or not) is the generality of its symptoms: high fever, headaches and joint pain, indicative of any viral infection.

The current notion is that dengue can cause a \u201ccontinuous spectrum of clinical disease\u201d. It may not give rise to symptoms at all or just cause a mild fever. On the other end of the spectrum, it can cause the fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is a \u2018vascular leak syndrome\u2019, where fluid oozes out of blood vessels, leaving behind thick blood that cannot flow. Severe DHF paralyses the circulatory system and leads to death._line_Another fallout of dengue being so generic in it symptoms is that it is grossly underreported. A 2014 study found that India\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) captures only 0.35% of the annual number of clinically diagnosed dengue cases. Using data from a case study in Madurai and extrapolations suggested by an expert panel, the study found that India could have had an annual average of 5,778,406 clinically diagnosed dengue cases between 2006 and 2012. That\u2019s 282-times the number reported every year (average)._line_\u201cThe government numbers are just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Soumya Swaminathan, the outgoing director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and soon to be deputy chief of the World Health Organisation, in an interview with PTI. Bearing this in mind, it is important to note that the NVBDCP estimated close to 130,000 cases and 250 deaths in 2016. As of August 2017, about 36,000 cases have already been reported in India._line_A virus-mosquito match that clicked_line_Dengue is caused by viruses of the genus Flavivirus. The story of dengue evolution started in the forests of Southeast Asia, where the ancient Flavivirus was probably a mosquito- or tick-borne virus, which diverged around 2,000 years ago by adapting to vertebrate hosts like birds, bats and forest-dwelling primates. The virus then adapted to survive in mosquitoes, using them as vectors: agents that can carry the virus and transmit the disease between hosts. The virus first evolved with Aedes albopictus, a day-biting mosquito common near forest areas, and later also began using Ae. aegypti._line_The fantastically versatile Ae. aegypti soon became the primary vector for dengue. The mosquito is highly adapted to the urban environment. It can breed in small collections of water. Even a small plastic cup would suffice. As the Aedes species spread all over the world with increased movement of humans and goods, dengue went with them. The 18th, 19th and 20th centuries saw many dengue pandemics, and the two World Wars accelerated the spread of the disease._line_\u201cThe main reason [for dengue\u2019s spread] is a combination of global trends that have all emerged and converged in the past few decades,\u201d wrote Duane Gubler, an internationally renowned dengue expert from the Duke-NUS Medical School, to The Wire in an email. \u201cPopulation growth, unprecedented urban growth that provides the ideal ecology for viruses and mosquitoes, globalisation and modern transportation that provides the ideal mechanism for transporting the viruses and mosquitoes among population centres; and, deterioration of public health infrastructure and lack of effective mosquito control in tropical cities.\u201d_line_The dengue virus today has four serotypes. A serotype is a group within a species of microorganisms that has its own set of distinctive surface structures. One serotype is usually responsible for one epidemic, but there have been cases where more than one serotype circulates during an epidemic._line_\u201cWhen a person already infected with one serotype is infected by a second, the body cannot fight both serotypes at the same time,\u201d CMC Vellore\u2019s Varghese told The Wire. The dengue virus has found a way to make its host\u2019s body turn against itself. Antibodies produced against one dengue serotype can enhance infection by a second serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. \u201cThis could be one reason for the increased severity of dengue infection in some cases,\u201d according to Varghese._line_A recent genetic analysis by the National Institute of Virology found that the prevalent dengue strains in India have been changing temporally. When dengue epidemics started in India in the 1950s and 1960s, all four serotypes were present in a mild form. Today, per the study, all four have been replaced by lineages with greater virulence and transmissibility. Genetic analyses have shown that the DENV-4 serotype, and a particular genotype of DENV-3, originated in India._line_\u201cIncreased transmission increases the rate of mutation in the virus, increasing the probability of new virus strains emerging that have greater fitness, epidemic potential and virulence\u201d, said Gubler._line_The Indian dengue epidemics have a very distinct trend. The first epidemics are in the south and then the disease spreads north. Mosquitoes breed better in warm, humid environments and they follow the monsoons northwards. \u201cThe rainy season, with increased humidity, increases the survival of the mosquito, thus increasing the probability that an infected mosquito will live long enough to transmit the virus to other persons,\u201d Gubler added._line_Combating dengue: getting rid of the mosquito_line_Fighting the disease by targeting the mosquito has been the favoured method to combat dengue thus far. Killing off adult mosquitoes by aerial spraying has been the go-to solution but its effectiveness has been questionable. Ae. aegypti dwells in sheltered areas where the spray doth not go. The chemicals need repeated application; the mosquitoes can develop resistance; and their environmental effects are numerous (remember DDT?). Studies have found that targeting the larval stage with chemicals like temefos is not a sure-shot method either. Using fish, like guppies, that eat up mosquito larvae has been discussed as an option but it could get expensive in the large scale. Using genetically modified mosquitoes carrying a lethal gene that can induce sterility in wild mosquitoes is under trial._line_Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia naturally infect many insects, though not mosquitoes that cause dengue. The bacteria can inhibit the growth of other microbes in its hosts and shorten their lifespan. Wolbachia is also compatible with a range of insects: a strain collected from one insect species can be used to infect another, even if the insect hosts are not related. A 2011 study by Scott O\u2019Neill and team from Monash University, Australia, found that the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis can be used to infect Ae. aegypti, where it can prevent the dengue virus from replicating in the mosquito._line_When introduced into an uninfected species, Wolbachia spreads rapidly. The idea is for Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes \u2013 which cannot carry dengue \u2013 to replace wild mosquitoes, inhibiting the virus\u2019s spread. During a field trial in Australia, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia were able to transform a population of wild mosquitoes. Moreover, after three months, the incidence of dengue in the mosquito population remained low. Based on the success of further field trials, Monash University launched a nonprofit called the World Mosquito Program, until recently called \u2018Eliminate Dengue\u2019. With an international team of funding agencies, the program has expanded to countries in Southeast Asia, South America, the Pacific islands and, most recently, to India._line_\u201cFrom the first discovery that Wolbachia can block the replication of arboviruses in the mosquito, to the establishment of Wolbachia in five countries with one million people protected by Wolbachia, has been an astonishing journey in a short space of time,\u201d said Cameron Simmons, the director of impact assessment at the World Mosquito Program._line_\u201cOur approach is not inconsistent with traditional mosquito control programs. In fact, we encourage communities and government to continue these efforts during and after we\u2019ve deployed Wolbachia,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, the reality is that traditional mosquito control programs are underfunded and imperfectly delivered. Indeed decades of evidence tells us that they have failed to stop disease transmission in endemic countries. It\u2019s time to try novel approaches that can deliver long-term, cost-effective reductions in disease incidence.\u201d_line_Using Wolbachia to combat mosquito-borne diseases has recently received approval from the WHO. Simmons and others at the World Mosquito Program are also confident that further evidence of reduced disease transmission, and improved public health in areas where Wolbachia has been introduced, will bring in more funding and widespread adoption of this technique. What will happen in India, however, remains to be seen._line_Combating dengue by tackling the virus_line_When a mosquito carrying dengue bites an unwary human being, the virus pops out of the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands onto human skin. The skin cell folds around the virus, forming a little pouch that draws the virus into the cell. Once safely inside, the virus disintegrates to reveal its incredibly simple genetic material: one strand of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is similar to our DNA. The virus then shows its true colours: it uses the host cell\u2019s machinery to make copies of itself. Different parts of baby viruses are made, assembled and finally released into the blood. The viruses then go on to infect other cells._line_The human body does not remain idle once it encounters a virus. It mounts an immune response, secreting white blood cells that seek out the virus and attempt to engulf it. But the virus has a devious trick up its sleeve: it infects the very cells sent out to kill it. As the infected white blood cells travel around the body, so does the virus, spreading all over and resulting in viremia \u2013 the presence of viruses in the bloodstream. Infected cells secrete chemicals called interferons, which activate further immune defences. Some types of white blood cells secrete antibodies that recognise and neutralise virus particles. The infected person now suffers from a fever lasting for about a week._line_Since fever is the first manifestation of the disease, it becomes difficult to differentiate dengue from a simple flu. The National Institute of Virology has a kit that can detect dengue, and other commercial tests are also available. An example is Dengue Day 1, a test that can detect dengue even before the onset of fever. Developed by Navin Khanna\u2019s research group from the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, the test is rapid and sensitive, capable of detecting dengue antibodies in very dilute samples._line_\u201cThe test can even tell you if you have had dengue in the past,\u201d Khanna told The Wire. \u201cThis kind of information is critical to the doctor. If it\u2019s secondary dengue, it is much more severe, and you can lose the patient in a day.\u201d Secondary dengue means a person who has had dengue before and has been infected again._line_\u201cEven as recently as five years ago, tests to detect dengue were very expensive\u201d, said Khanna. \u201cNow, the costs have plummeted.\u201d_line_Since dengue has been around for many hundreds of years, traditional medical practices have evolved their own ways of dealing with the disease. Vaccinating against dengue has been part of the plan to combat the disease \u2013 but vaccine candidates are still not in a position to hit the market. Global pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has developed a vaccine against dengue but India has not approved it for use. \u201cI salute Sanofi for spending 20 years, and 1.2 billion dollars, on a tropical disease that is not their problem,\u201d said Khanna. \u201cThe Sanofi vaccine does not work on patients who have never had dengue before; it is a booster vaccine. There has also been health issues post vaccination, especially in children\u201d._line_The WHO has said, \u201ca dengue vaccine would represent a major advance in the control of the disease\u201d, and many teams are working on a vaccine that can provide cover against all four dengue serotypes._line_The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated 58.4 million dengue cases in 2013 and about 10,000 deaths worldwide. These numbers translate into an economic burden of almost $9 billion in 2013 alone. Though the number of deaths due to dengue is relatively small, the pressure on healthcare systems and the reduction in workforce strength due to the illness take a heavy toll._line_The fight against dengue thus needs to be at many levels: measures to control Aedes mosquito populations, vaccinating against the mosquito using techniques like Wolbachia infections, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease and, finally, developing a vaccine that can fight against all four serotypes. _line_

VExploited by the racing industry, they're now being bled for profit in Texas._line_By any measure, Jasper\u2019s got it good, but he hasn\u2019t always led \u201cthe life of Riley.\u201d_line_Like most greyhounds, he was used, abused and discarded by the notorious dog-racing industry. When he was \u201cretired\u201d following a leg injury after just a year of racing, he was severely underweight, riddled with internal parasites and suffering from serious dental neglect. He was terrified of men and is still skittish around them._line_Today, Jasper weighs a healthy 90 pounds and lives with my friend and her three cats in a cozy house with a spacious yard in Norfolk, Virginia.

Like Jasper, most were treated as commodities by an industry that cares only about profits. But unlike him, they\u2019re still being denied exercise, companionship and the chance to bond with a human family\u2014everything that makes life meaningful to them._line_Instead, these graceful, sweet-tempered dogs are routinely abused by another self-serving profiteer: The Pet Blood Bank, Inc., a dog-blood factory farm that sells their blood to veterinary supply companies._line_A PETA exposé revealed that the greyhounds are snared with a crude catchpole and put in crates for hours\u2014often while muzzled and without access to water in the blazing-hot Texas sun\u2014before finally being taken into a trailer to be bled. After losing up to 20 percent of their blood volume, many are so weak that they have to be carried back to the squalid, dirt-floored wire cages and the old chemical tanks that serve as their \u201cshelter.\u201d They stay there, usually all alone, until they\u2019re bled again._line_Deprived of any enrichment or activity, they chew on the tanks, leaving sharp, jagged edges that can cut and puncture their thin skin. Many of them pace and spin in circles\u2014clear signs of severe psychological distress. Others cry out when approached or are so terrified that they cower and lose control of their bladders or bowels._line_Veterinary care for them is nonexistent. The nails of many of these dogs are so overgrown that they curl around into their paw pads, causing them to limp. Many suffer from severe gingivitis and receding gums, which make eating difficult. In a crude attempt to control ticks and other parasites, workers spray the dogs with an insecticide meant for buildings and trees, blistering their skin and irritating their eyes. Two greyhounds, who had no access to water, were found dead in their kennels._line_But this blood factory isn\u2019t the only place where \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d is being abused and exploited._line_About four hours to the east, in College Station, experimenters at Texas A&M University deliberately breed golden retrievers to develop muscular dystrophy.

VAre you a fan of Ryan Phillippe? I am. As an actor, he\u2019s been in the public eye for nearly 25-years, appearing on various television shows and in movies._line_Currently, Phillippe is the star of USA\u2019s Shooter; an action-packed series where he plays the part of a retired veteran coaxed back into work so that he can save the lives of others._line_I\u2019m the first to admit the show is high on testosterone and violent. Still, I kind of dig it because the plot is always changing. But that\u2019s not what this post is really about._line_Instead, I\u2019d like to briefly focus your awareness on a recent disclosure Phillippe made about his battle with depression; something men almost never talk about [see post about men and depression]._line_Here\u2019s what he shared in a recent interview:_line_\u201cI believe that depression and mood disorders are on a spectrum akin to the way autism is, where it\u2019s an individual experience._line_I think people fear being stigmatized or treated in a blanket fashion, which is sometimes the response to someone who says, \u2018I struggle with depression.\u2019_line_But really, depression could manifest in a thousand different ways depending on who it is.
