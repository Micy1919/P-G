VPhoto source: Thinkstock.  Washington. Having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) raises the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to a recent study. Researchers reported that biomarkers for amyloid beta, the plaque-building peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease, increase over time in elderly adults with OSA in proportion to OSA severity. Thus, individuals with more apneas per hour had greater accumulation of brain amyloid over time. According to the authors, AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts approximately five million older Americans. OSA is even more common, afflicting from 30 to 80 per cent of the elderly, depending on how OSA is defined. "Several studies have suggested that sleep disturbances might contribute to amyloid deposits and accelerate cognitive decline in those at risk for AD," said senior author Ricardo S. Osorio from the New York University School of Medicine. "However, so far it has been challenging to verify causality for these associations because OSA and AD share risk factors and commonly coexist." He added that the purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between OSA severity and changes in AD biomarkers longitudinally, specifically whether amyloid deposits increase over time in healthy elderly participants with OSA. The study included 208 participants, age 55 to 90, with normal cognition as measured by standardized tests and clinical evaluations. None of the participants was referred by a sleep center, used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat sleep apnea, was depressed, or had a medical condition that might affect their brain function. The researchers performed lumbar punctures (LPs) to obtain participants' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble A? levels, and then used positron emission tomography, or PET, to measure A? deposits directly in the brain in a subset of participants. The study found that more than half the participants had OSA, including 36.5 percent with mild OSA and 16.8 percent with moderate to severe OSA. From the total study sample, 104 participated in a two-year longitudinal study that found a correlation between OSA severity and a decrease in CSF A?42 levels over time. The authors said that this finding is compatible with an increase in amyloid deposits in the brain; the finding was confirmed in the subset of participants who underwent amyloid PET, which showed an increase in amyloid burden in those with OSA. The high prevalence of OSA the study found in these cognitively normal elderly participants and the link between OSA and amyloid burden in these very early stages of AD pathology, the researchers believe, suggest the CPAP, dental appliances, positional therapy and other treatments for sleep apnea could delay cognitive impairment and dementia in many older adults. The study appears in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. \u2014 ANI.

He was reportedly found indulging in offence despite earlier actions against him. The court also suspended licenses of 48 others for repeated violations. . Between November 6 and 10, as many as 539 chargesheets were filed against the nabbed drunken drivers. They were produced in the 3rd and 4th Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Erramanzil, Hyderabad. All the arrested persons were sent to Chanchalguda central prison. As many as 17 licences were suspended temporarily. A fine of `11.48 lakh was also imposed on them. . Persons caught and convicted in drunk driving cases are likely to face difficulties in securing government jobs, passport and visa clearance. The violators will be sent for counselling at the Traffic Training Institute at Goshamahal, and Begumpet. Joint commissioner (traffic) Dr V Ravinder said around 539 persons were charge-sheeted in the 3rd and 4th metropolitan magistrate courts after they were caught repeatedly against drunk driving under various police station limits in the city. .

V There are high chances that excess of it can result in infection of the hair follicle which can be painful. So, get rid of all these unwanted hairs smartly. .   By  AuthorIANS  |  Published: 13th Nov 2017  12:25 am . The most common type of ear hair is the one that grows out from the edge of the ear canal. There are high chances that excess of it can result in infection of the hair follicle which can be painful. So, get rid of all these unwanted hairs smartly. Trimming. A battery operated light weight trimmer with a skin guard can be used twice or thrice a week depending on the growth of the hair. Also avoid using sharp scissors as any cuts can lead to permanent scars. Hair removal creams. Even though using depilatory creams seems like an easier option it can lead to itching and can make the treated areas highly sensitive. Also there\u2019s a risk of pushing the cream deep into your ear canals which can potentially damage the sensitive skin inside. Tweezers. This method of hair removal is time consuming and can be very painful. Also there\u2019s a risk of damaging your hair follicle which can lead to infection. Laser hair removal. The laser hair removal device destroys the hair follicle without damaging the skin. Before the procedure the hair is shaved using a razor followed by application of a cold gel. It needs to be done once a month and typically requires 6 to 8 treatment sessions for the hair to disappear. An interesting fact to note is that this works only on black pigment hair, so if you\u2019ve grey or white hair you will not be able to laser them away. It\u2019s a quick service and requires just 15 minutes to do the procedure. Use sun protection post laser.

VIt may be considered as one of the most common "sleep aids" people employ to help them drift off at night, but according to a recent study, alcohol can actually be a roadblock to good sleep in teenagers. The Rutgers University-Camden research linked insomnia to frequency of alcohol use among early adolescents. "Parents, educators, and therapists should consider insomnia to be a risk marker for alcohol use, and alcohol use a risk marker for insomnia, among early adolescents," wrote researcher Naomi Marmorstein. Marmorstein examined the associations between alcohol use and four sleep-related issues: initial insomnia; daytime sleepiness; sleep irregularity, defined as the difference in weekday and weekend bedtimes; and disturbed sleep, characterized as nightmares, snoring, sleepwalking, wetting the bed, and talking in sleep. When sleep problems were found to be associated with frequency of alcohol use, she examined whether symptoms of mental health problems or levels of parental monitoring accounted for these associations. The research focused on seventh- and eighth-grade students participating in the Camden Youth Development Study, an initiative funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. The study examines the development of mental health problems and resilience among at-risk youth. Youth completed questionnaires in the classroom that asked how long it took for them to fall asleep, what times they usually went to bed on a weekday and on the weekend or vacation night, how often they experienced sleep disturbances, and whether they ever fell asleep in class or had trouble staying awake after school. They were also asked the frequency of any alcohol use in the previous four months. In addition, students answered questions which were used to assess depressive symptoms, as well as evidence of conduct disorder symptoms. Teachers also completed questionnaires, which were analyzed to determine the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Overall, there were associations between alcohol and both insomnia and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, Marmorstein determined that symptoms of mental health problems and parental monitoring did not account for the link between insomnia and alcohol use. She said that these findings indicate that insomnia may be a unique risk marker for alcohol use among young adolescents. The study is published recently in the journal Addictive Behaviors.

VMushroom.  Mushrooms may contain unusually high amounts of antioxidants which could help fight ageing and bolster health, a study claims.  Researchers found that mushrooms have high amounts of ergothioneine and glutathione, both important antioxidants.  \u201cWhat we found is that, without a doubt, mushrooms are highest dietary source of these two antioxidants taken together, and that some types are really packed with both of them,\u201d said Robert Beelman, professor at Pennsylvania State University in the US. He said when body uses food to produce energy, it also causes oxidative stress because some free radicals are produced.  Free radicals are oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons that cause damage to cells, proteins and even DNA, as these highly reactive atoms travel through the body seeking to pair up with other electrons. Replenishing antioxidants in the body, then, might help protect against this oxidative stress. \u201cWhen we oxidise our food to produce energy there is a number of free radicals that are produced that are side products of that action and many of these are quite toxic,\u201d said Beelman. \u201cThe body has mechanisms to control most of them, including ergothioneine and glutathione, but eventually enough accrue to cause damage, which has been associated with many of the diseases of ageing, like cancer, coronary heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d he said.  The study published in the journal Food Chemistry, found that the amounts of ergothioneine and glutathione in mushrooms vary by species.

VNeymar and Mbappe. Although he's performing well on the pitch, it's fair to say Neymar has had a rocky start to his Paris Saint-Germain career off of it. . The Brazilian has reportedly already fallen out with members of his new squad and coach Unai Emery following his record-breaking move from Barcelona. . Some members of the PSG squad are unhappy with the special treatment Neymar is entitled to, which apparently includes having two personal physiotherapists and being let off from defensive duties. . To make things worse, the forward also had a very public spat with striker Edinson Cavani back in September, when the pair clashed over who should take a penalty. . Despite the reported rifts in the team, Neymar has already been paying off his £200 million fee and has 11 goals from 12 appearances in Ligue 1 and the Champions League already this season. . The 25-year-old and many of his teammates are currently on international duty, but despite not playing club football this week, speculation about the forward's career in France continues to mount. . In fact, during a press conference following Brazil's 3-1 win against Japan on Friday, Neymar became emotional while defending himself against reports he's unhappy at PSG. . He asked the press to stop creating stories that aren't true and claimed he's happy with his current team before appearing to leave the conference in tears. . Neymar himself is not the only one who believes he's settled in at Paris, with teammate Kylian Mbappe also moving to quell any reports that the club's front line isn't getting along. . "He feels good here and will achieve great things," Mbappe told PSG's official website, per Goal. . "Having a player like him who helps you every day is really good. He is a great player. We are very happy to have him with us.". The young Frenchman, who himself joined PSG in the summer, also insisted Neymar had a big influence in helping him settle into his new team. . "He facilitated my integration, took me under his wing. With me, he behaves like a big brother." . With both Neymar and teammate Mbappe confirming the Brazilian is happy in France, PSG will be hopeful of big things this season. . The side are expecting to challenge for both Ligue 1 and the Champions League this term and a settled Neymar will be central to their plans. .

VDressed in a black Givenchy dress and pearls, Hepburn made a fashion statement that Tiffany believes still resonates with shoppers.  Social media on Friday buzzed with the choices, which include truffle eggs, buttermilk waffles and vegan avocado toast. (Photo: Pixabay). A half-century after Audrey Hepburn starred in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2018s,\u201d the landmark New York jewellery store is making the title of the 1961 romantic comedy film a reality by opening a cafe where shoppers can enjoy a morning meal. The new eatery, which opened on Friday, is an opportunity for customers at Tiffany & Co\u2019s Fifth Avenue flagship store, including foreign tourists who account for a big chunk of sales, to get a taste of the glamour epitomized by Hepburn\u2019s Holly Golightly character. Dressed in a black Givenchy dress and pearls, Hepburn made a fashion statement that Tiffany believes still resonates with shoppers. Like many traditional retailers, Tiffany has struggled to appeal to younger shoppers, many of whom have shunned the type of traditional jewellery, such as solitaire engagement rings, that is the brand\u2019s mainstay. As part of its strategy to attract millennials, the company introduced the more contemporary Tiffany HardWear collection in an agreement with pop star Lady Gaga earlier this year. After a sharp drop from their 2014 high, Tiffany shares have risen about 6 percent since the company struck a turnaround deal with activist investor Jana Partners in February. The new Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor of the Fifth Avenue store may help the brand recapture its buzz, too. It is designed for \u201ccustomers who have always dreamed of having Breakfast at Tiffany,\u201d the company said in a statement. The eatery, decorated in Tiffany\u2019s signature robin-egg blue motif, offers breakfast at $29, excluding tax and tip. The menu is based on \u201cAmerican classics made with the highest quality, regionally sourced ingredients.\u201d. Social media on Friday buzzed with the choices, which include truffle eggs, buttermilk waffles and vegan avocado toast. And for those new millennial customers who may be later sleepers and less familiar than their mothers with \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2018s,\u201d the cafe offers a $39 pre-fixe lunch and $49 high tea.

VReferring to Gandhi's promise to cap GST rates at 18 per cent if voted to power, Javadekar said the Congress vice-president intends to increase the tax burden on the common people. . Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar. With Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi pushing for rationalization of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday said Congress leaders are "hypocrites" as they support the indirect tax at GST Council meets but speak against it in public. Referring to Gandhi's promise to cap GST rates at 18 per cent if voted to power, Javadekar said the Congress vice-president intends to increase the tax burden on the common people. "I want to ask what kind of uniform tax structure he (Gandhi) wants? He is advocating for 18 per cent GST on all items. It means that all those commodities that fall in zero per cent, 5 per cent or 12 per cent slabs should be charged at 18 per cent. It seems the Congress wants to increase the tax burden on people," Javadekar said at a press conference here. Gandhi, who has been spearheading an aggressive campaign against the BJP for the next month's assembly polls, on Saturday said he would not rest till the five-slab "Gabbar Singh Tax" was converted into the "Goods and Services Tax" with an 18-per cent cap. "Congress leaders are 'pakhandi' as they are adopting double standards on GST. They were also involved in preparing GST rates. During the GST Council meetings, Congress ministers support GST, but after coming out of the meetings they tell people that they are against it," the senior BJP leader said.  . He said Gandhi's visit to Surat, the country's diamond polishing hub, on November 8 turned out to be a damp squib. "Rahul visited Surat with a hope that a large number of people would turn up to listen to him. But, it did not happen. People on board his flight to Delhi told us that Rahul was very angry. It shows that people have rejected him and the Congress's politics of hypocrisy, something which we never do," Javadekar said.  He earlier participated in a door-to-door campaign in Sabarmati area of the city.

VBengaluru: What is the essence of Karnataka? Tolerance, said artist Suresh Jayaram, quoting writer U.R. Ananthamurthy as he made his opening remarks at the launch of Perspectives of Karnataka Modern Art. Over 130 artists going back more than a 100 years and 250 works of art have been put together in Jayaram's mammoth curatorial project. The National Gallery of Modern Art saw an exemplary turnout on Saturday evening, with Artists, students and art lovers thronged the National Gallery of Modern Art, stragglers gathering outside the already packed auditorium. The exhibition was launched by former Chief Secretary Sudhakar Rao, a long time supporter of the NGMA, theatre personality Arundhati Nag and the exhibition's curator, Suresh Jayaram. . "Regional explorations change one's perspective," said Jayaram. "It leads me to look at the ground I stand on and the people I have met. It led me to search for maps and new connections in which I could explore my subject. And artists have opened their doors to us, sharing stories, giving us links to lesser known bits of history, leading us to others they know who have been forgotten and unarchived." Sure enough, some of the paintings at the exhibition bear no name or details - a silent tribute to the many artists who have lived and died unseen. . Karnataka is an amalgamation, said Jayaram, of styles, schools of thought and beliefs, said Jayaram, adding, "It's been a wonderful journey." . Theatre personality Arundhati Nag remarked, at the outset, in Kannada, that Karnataka is not her home state, saying, "It has embraced me. Over the years, I have been Karnataka's daughter, daughter-in-law and her baby. I'm very grateful to be here to mark this historic day for NGMA and for the state." Nag had her audiences thoroughly tickled with her anecdotes, as she said, "I wanted to be a painter, but my mother told me to do something useful. So I studied commerce and then found my way to the performing arts. I have served theatre for 45 years." .

VAs governments bicker and dilly-dally, the average citizen has to take remedial measures, and masks are the first line of defence.  Fashion accessories have hitherto meant handbags, shoes, belts, hats, scarves, cosmetics, perfumes and the like. But one item is about to become a permanent member of this club: pollution masks. As governments bicker and dilly-dally, the average citizen has to take remedial measures, and masks are the first line of defence. And there is nothing as au courant in polluted cities today as N99 filter masks with a designer touch. .  Some versions have already featured in fashion weeks, notably in China. Indeed, Chinese fashionistas speak as knowledgeably about mask brands as they do about \u201cIt\u201d bags now. The rest of the world must catch up. While a few Indian designers have also featured masks in their catwalk collections, it is time they \u2014 and their counterparts abroad \u2014 make a serious bid to tap into the growing segment that is as fashion-conscious as it is pollution conscious. .   Some designers have collaborated with established premier mask manufacturers to present souped-up special editions, but the affordable luxury market still needs to be addressed. And in the Indian context, there simply must be glamorous options for the wedding season \u2014 given that so many functions are held outdoors \u2014 sporty ones for T20 cricket matches, white khadi ones for politicians, cool ones for colleges, uniform-specific ones for schools and so on. .

V44th Jawaharlal Nehru National Science, Mathematics and Environment Exhibition (JNNSMEE) is currently going on in Bhopal and the students, who had to take part in the exhibition from Ryan International School, Ghaziabad, have been forced to face useless and humiliating questions from the visitors about the murder of Pradyuman Thakur. The most hurtful moment for the students came when the Education Minister of Madhya Pradesh Vijay Shah said, "Oh, you are from killer school?" As per reports in the Times of India, the day was 'heartbreaking' for the two students who were representing Ryan International at the JNNSMEE. "We faced difficulty every time we told visitors that we are from Ryan International," confessed the students. "We are terribly shocked by the behaviour of people toward us. We know what happened in Ryan Gurugram was heart-wrenching, but does that mean all of us are culprits," the students said while talking to TOI. \u201cSince the time we displayed our model, many visitors asked us weird questions and made humiliating gestures at us," the students further added. The students of Ryan International were explaining their model to the Education Minister Vijay Shah when he cut them in the mid and asked the name of his school. And when the students told him that he is from Ryan International, he started laughing and said, "Oh, the killer school?" The students were stunned with his reaction and when Mr Shah realised his mistake he said, \u201cJust Joking.\u201d. After the incident, the students said, "We don't know who he is, but his remark was very shocking. It made us uneasy. It is so bad to make us students feel dejected as if we were the culprits. Even if he meant it as a joke, why do we have to face it?". The Central Bureau of Investigation has disclosed its inquiry in the Ryan International murder case and revealed that the Gurgaon Police accused the bus conductor Ashok Kumar of being the killer by planting the murder weapon upon him. The agency also declared that Pradyuman Thakur was killed by an 11th standard student of the same school.

VIt is known that Ranbir Kapoor and Mahira Khan\u2019s pictures went viral a few days back. The duo, who are rumored to be dating, was seen smoking outside a hotel in the pictures.Post that, Mahira was trolled for smoking outside a hotel in New York and wearing a short dress. Reacting to this, Ranbir Kapoor in a statement to a leading daily said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Mahira in a personal capacity over the last few months. She is somebody who I admire and respect, for her achievements and even more for the person she is. It is very unfair the way she is being judged and spoken about. What is also said is the inequality in judgment just because she is a woman. I request you to stop the negativity and move on with your beautiful god gifted lives. Peace and Love.\u201d. He further added, \u201cPS: Both smoking and hate are injurious to health.\u201d. Recently during a press meet when Rishi Kapoor was asked about the viral pictures of Ranbir and Mahira, he got furious and blasted at the media persons. He even threatened to slap if the same question is asked ever again. He also asked them to ask relevant questions and not to just add masala to their news. Earlier during an interview, Rishi Kapoor said, \u2018\u2019 \u201cHe can meet anybody whoever he wants to, and if people are going to invade his privacy, it\u2019s not done.\u201d.

The premium innerwear and sleepwear range to be manufactured by Lux Industries will incorporate One8\u2019s subtle branding, look and feel emphasizing the simplicity of Virat\u2019s personal style, while the dynamic colours of the products will be a reflection of Virat\u2019s on-field persona. .

VYour Pixelbook's about to get a lot more productive. If you've got the spare $1000 to spend, Google's Pixelbook currently offers the absolute best Chrome OS experience you can find. However, that doesn't mean the device is without its issues. One area of aggravation lies with Chrome OS's inability to properly multitask when in tablet mode, but thanks to the latest updated in Chrome OS 64, this is finally changing. Discovered by Googler and Chrome fanatic François Beaufort, Split View multitasking can now be enabled in tablet mode by enabling a flag within the Dev Channel for Chrome OS. The flag is labeled as chrome://flags/#enable-tablet-splitview, and once turned on, you'll be able to tap on the overview icon to see which windows are open and then move them to either side to snap them in place and run two tabs of Chrome on the screen at once. Split View in tablet mode currently only works with the Chrome browser, meaning that you still can't run two Android apps side-by-side when using your Pixelbook as a tablet. That's undoubtedly disappointing, but even so, this is a big step in the right direction for where Chrome OS needs to be. Split View in tablet mode on a Pixelbook. There's no ETA for when this feature will be available to use without having to enable the developer flag, but our guess is that it'll be here soon. Keep an eye out.

V Uttarkashi: The villagers of Assi Ganga valley, one of the areas in Uttarkashi district which was badly affected by the 2013 Kedarnath disaster, are waiting for reconstruction and relief work for the past four years. Local residents alleged that most of the major roads, bridges, schools and medical centres of the region have not been totally restored and continue to be in bad shape. The valley, which is situated barely 5 km away from the district headquarters, was devastated by the floods in 2012 as well.  Residents of villages such as Gajoli, Seku, Naugaun, Bhankoli, Agora, Uttaron and a few others said that \u201cit was a pity that the region \u2013 which has a lot of adventure tourism potential, was being neglected like this.\u201d.  \u201cThe government never focused on constructing the damaged roads, bridges and government buildings here. It is the entry point to the famous Dodital lake but little has been done to enhance tourism potential. The few constructions that were done over the years are of little use for us,\u201d said Kamleshwar Prasad Khanduri, a resident of Gajoli village.  A major 20-km road connecting Sangamchatti and Gajoli region to the Rishikesh-Gangotri National Highway is still under construction for the past four years. One of the bridges connecting Uttaron village, that was rebuilt by government agencies, has technical faults. A health facility and another cooperative centre are still non-functional since they were reconstructed two years ago. Many of the smaller bridges, including the one connecting Agora to Dodital trek, are still broken. Villagers, including children, are forced to cross rivers and rivulets using wooden logs.  The scenario in government schools is no good either. Several of these lack basic infrastructure and records little attendance. The situation during monsoon gets worse as classrooms getting inundated with rain water.  \u201cAs many as 9,000 villagers of the valley have been living in pitiable situation due to negligence of the state government. We have protested several times and pleaded before senior officials but little has been done,\u201d said Dinesh Singh, a resident of Naugaun village.  Meanwhile, sub-divisional magistrate of Bhatwari, Devendra Singh Negi, said, \u201cThe administration has ordered all construction agencies to speed up work in the villages and surrounding areas. Our main priority is to finish the pending projects first. Other issues will be resolved subsequently.\u201d.

VCrawford Hall.  MYSURU: The University of Mysore vice-chancellor search committee is in the dark over the governor's letter directing the state government to send a new panel of names for the post. According to sources, the state government is likely to pursue the old panel of names with the governor. The department of higher education may seek legal opinion in this matter. .  V B Coutinho, a member of the search committee and UoM syndicate nominee in it, said the state government is yet to notify panel members on the issue. "It's better to opt for new names instead of keeping the post vacant for an indefinite period. But I haven't received any intimation on the governor's direction seeking fresh a panel of new names," he said. .  He also said the delay in the appointment of vice-chancellors will harm the interest of the universities. .  According to sources in the higher education department, the government may seek opinion from the law department over the governor's letter which could further delay the appointment. "The state government is clear on its stand and wants to pursue the old panel of names. So, the department of higher education may seek the law department's opinion on further action," said an officer who is privy to the developments. .  Meanwhile, the term of the incumbent in-charge VC of UoM Dayananda Mane ends on November 23. "He will be succeeded by another senior dean of the university," said sources in the university. .  "C Basavaraju, faculty of law, Ningamma C Betsur, faculty of education and T K Umesh, faculty of science are the three seniormost academicians in the race for the VC in-charge post. Mane will send the list to the governor who in turn selects the in-charge VC who will hold the post till the appointment of a new VC," he said. .  Meanwhile, S N Hegde, former VC, UoM and president of the Forum of Former Vice-Chancellors of Karnataka State Universities (FVCK), said the delay in the appointment of the new VC is not good for any university. "The process of appointing a new VC should be expedited. This abnormal delay is causing damage to the academic, research and other activities of the university," he said. .  "The VC's post of UoM has been vacant for the past 10 months. In-charge VC has no powers to take any major decision. The syndicate members also don't have powers," he said. .

VMahindra and Ford signed a global partnership to explore electric vehicle technology; Mahindra\u2019s electric sedan likely to use Ford\u2019s underpinning. Mahindra has tied up with Ford in order to use synergies to explore electric vehicle technology and grow bigger in Indian and in overseas markets as well. The homegrown auto major claims talks with Ford are moving towards a positive direction. As we have reported earlier, the American auto maker will use Mahindra\u2019s electric powertrain technology for its India-spec future EVs, while Mahindra will use Ford\u2019s global vehicle architecture. The upcoming Mahindra electric sedan is expected to be underpinned by Ford Ka platform. This vehicle platform comes as a shorter and cheaper derivative of the global market-spec Ka+. The Ka architecture also underpins cars like Ford Figo and Ford Aspire. Mahindra aims to use this same underpinning for its future EVs. Apart from Indian market, both the automakers will use their synergies in global market-spec products as well. This way, both the brands will be able to share technologies and components in order to increase profitability and grow the business further. Speaking about their partnership in India, both the companies are discussing connected car technologies, product development, sales and distribution issues alongside electric powertrain tech. Interestingly, For and Mahindra were partners in India back in 1990\u2019s and reviving the partnership after nearly two decades is a very positive sign for the Indian market as well. As the Indian market is thriving towards zero emission pure electric mobility and targeting to achieve that by 2030, such a partnership is expected to boost the initiative, as both the automakers play crucial role in the domestic market. Also, the news of both the brands working positively towards their partnership comes as a welcome move after Tata Motors and Volkswagen\u2019s proposed partnership didn\u2019t work out, as both the companies couldn\u2019t find benefit from their alliance. While Mahindra and Ford are yet to disclose further details about the development of their alliance, we are hopeful to learn more in coming days.  Source: Moneycontrol.

VAn Air India flight. An FIR has been registered against a former executive director of Air India for allegedly stealing a painting by renowned artist Jatin Das which was part of the airline's collection,the police said. The FIR follows an internal inquiry conducted by Air India, which found that former executive director (ED) Rohita Jaidka removed the painting from Air India's possession between 2004 and 2009. "The airline approached the police and an FIR was registered on November 11 against Jaidka and other unidentified persons," the police said. The issue of the stolen painting came to light when Das, a Padma Bhushan awardee, wrote to the airline in June claiming that one of his paintings had gone missing and was available in the open market. The letter prompted Air India to launch an internal probe. The horizontal oil painting is titled 'Flying Apsara'. It was commissioned in 1991 by Air India. After the incident came to light, the painting was returned to the airline headquarters "in a torn condition" from a fake address in Noida. Air India in its complaint also pegs the value of the painting at Rs 25,00,000 "as per evaluations by an art historian". Jatin Das has himself refused to attach a value to the piece of art.

VApple fans still waiting to receive the iPhone X, you\u2019re not going to like this. A game designer from Shenzen, China bought not one, not two, not three, but 25 iPhone X smartphones only to arrange them in a heart shape and propose to his girlfriend.  While iPhone X shipping times have been increased to 6 weeks, this guy managed to secure no less than 25 units to impress his girlfriend. The new iPhones were placed on the ground to form a super-expensive heart with an engagement ring right in the middle.  There are two whys that need to be answered right now. First of all, why the iPhone X?.  As it turns out, the two are big fans of mobile games, so with the iPhone X they are supposed to be able to enjoy pretty much any game they want with no performance hiccup.  And then, why 25? Bride-to-be Lee is 25, so the man decided to buy just as many iPhone X units to form the gigantic heart that you can see in the photo below.He\u2019s giving the iPhone Xs awayAnd now here comes the more important question: does he plan to keep all the 25 iPhone X units? He does not, as the man decided to give each of the friends who helped propose to her girlfriend an iPhone X as a sign of appreciation.  For what it\u2019s worth, the iPhone X costs no less than 8,388 yuan in China, so according to a report from OddityCentral, the young developer spent no less than 210,000 yuan (that\u2019s about $31,500) just for the heart. If you\u2019re still interested, she said yes, but no other specifics were provided.  In the meantime, do want to buy an iPhone X from Apple, the company has a hard time aligning production with demand given the huge number of orders and shipments have been pushed back to December. And judging from today\u2019s report, it\u2019s no wonder why.

V Consequences of brain injury resulting from oxygen deprivation affect the entire lifespan. (Photo: Pixabay). A team of researchers has identified a promising treatment to reduce or prevent brain injury in newborns who have suffered hypoxia-ischemia, a serious complication in which restricted blood flow deprives the brain of oxygen. Consequences of brain injury resulting from oxygen deprivation affect the entire lifespan and range from mild (learning disabilities) to severe (inability to breathe, walk, talk or see). This complication can occur during or before birth due to maternal/placental problems, such as placental abruption or cord prolapse, or due to fetal/newborn issues, such as asphyxia due to labor difficulties, infection, fetal-maternal bleeding or twin-to-twin transfusion. The study by research-clinicians at Children's National Health System evaluated newborn experimental models exposed to hypoxia-ischemia. The experimental models were given standard cooling therapy (therapeutic hypothermia) alone and in combination with a selective Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, that blocks a regulatory enzyme of apoptosis (cell death), which intensifies as a result of hypoxia-ischemia. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a Src kinase inhibitor as an oncology treatment. This study is the first to test the benefits of blocking this enzyme in reducing the neurological damage caused by brain hypoxia-ischemia. "In hypoxia-ischemia, CaM kinase is over-activated, but hypothermia has been shown to decrease this enzyme's activation. We theorized that a Src kinase inhibitor, in addition to hypothermia, would further attenuate the activation of CaM kinase IV and that the result might be less brain damage," explained lead author Panagiotis Kratimenos. "From this study, we were pleased that this seems to be the case.". The authors concluded that hypothermia alone attenuated the over-activation of CaM kinase IV and improved neuropathology after hypoxia. However, the combination of hypothermia with Src kinase inhibition following hypoxia further attenuated the increased activation of CaM kinase IV, compared with hypothermia alone in the newborn experimental model brain. "If confirmed by further studies, this approach--in combination with cooling -- may help to further attenuate neurological damage that babies suffer after experiencing hypoxia-ischemia," said Kratimenos. The study is published in Neonatology.

VBeijing: Chinese scientists have found the first genetic pathway underlying natural variation in ageing, which could provide insights for developing interventions to slow down the process of growing old in humans, state media reported today. . The scientists, studying a worm, found that the combination of a certain neuropeptide coding gene and its receptor gene controls the stress reaction of a "longevity gene", which regulates the rate of ageing, China Daily reported. The more active the coding gene and stronger the receptor gene, the more rapid ageing occurs, according to the team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Neuroscience. An article about their study, which took more than five years, was published yesterday in the journal Nature. Uncovering the genetic secrets of the ageing rate is significant, as the average age of the global population is rising fast. Ageing is also a major risk factor for diseases, such as cancers and diabetes, the researchers said. According to the UN, the number of people aged 60 or older hit 1 billion worldwide this year and will rise to 3.1 billion by 2100. China itself has over 250 million above 60 years as it is undergoing demographic change. "When people live longer, they begin to care more about healthy ageing, which means keeping healthy and youthful and having a better quality of life in their twilight years, like some lucky ones do," said Cai Shiqing, the team's lead researcher. One peer review of the article said the results will be of interest to the readers of Nature because of the general lack of information about how natural genetic variation regulates ageing and the role of neuromodulatory signalling in the process. Lab experiments were conducted on Caenorhabditis elegans, a transparent worm about 1 millimetre in length that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the basis of the animal model widely used for age-related research because of its clear genetic profile and short lifespan - an average of three weeks. The tiny free-living worms from different parts of the world show varied rates of decline in virility, eating and locomotion during ageing. Researchers said they have not yet found the worms' neuropeptide in the human body. "But we know that animal evolution is conservative, and if we carry on with further studies we're confident that we will probably find that the mechanism underlying the ageing rate of mammals is the same as for the worms," said Mu-Ming Poo, director of the institute and an academician of the science academy. "Healthy human life can be extended if there is a way to target these genes in the future," he said. PTI .

VThe Borth Wild Animal Kingdom in west Wales has said that it is "outraged and devastated" over the decision of the Ceredigion council to kill its 18-moths-old female lynx, who was on the run for two weeks in a trailer park in Aberystwyth, due to the dangers it posed to people. "The decision to kill her was not ours and we in no way agreed to or participated in the shooting of our baby lynx," the zoo said in a statement on its Facebook page. "We are truly devastated and outraged that this happened.". The Eurasian female lynx, called Lillith, which was about twice the size of a domestic cat, had been on the run from the park in Ceredigion, west Wales, since Sunday, October 29. The park had said the year-and-a-half-old lynx did not pose a danger to people but had urged against getting too close to the animal, although there have never been any records of them attacking humans. According to the zoo, the only options available to them were "live catching with nets or luring her into one of the many bait traps that they built and placed in areas she was frequenting.". The animal was shot after straying into a trailer park near Aberystwyth town center. A hunter contracted by Ceredigion council defended the decision by arguing that the lynx could have run if he tried to tranquilize it. there was no need to kill the welsh lynx, a very very sad story indeed shame on you Dean and Tracy Tweedy from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom.

VWhy give Thule all that money when plywood is cheap?.  Before there was the Impreza, there was the Leone. Sold in the United States at first as, simply, The Subaru, the Loyale name appeared on the last few years of the third-generation Leones. Here's a final-model-year example of the Loyale wagon in a Denver wrecking yard, complete with rust, outdoorsy-activity-themed stickers, and interesting homebuilt plywood upgrades.  These cars weren't quite as sturdy as their successors, but this one reached the magical 200,000-mile mark during its quarter-century on the roads and trails of Colorado.  For some reason, there's a mid-1990s Mazda Miata M Edition badge on the tailgate. Some Colorado Subaru dealerships sell "Rocky Mountain Edition" option packages, so perhaps this was the Loyale owner's way of joining the exclusive club for owners of Subarus with snow-grooved floormats and ski-friendly roof racks.  In keeping with that theme of homebrewed upgrades, this car has a plywood version of the roof-mounted cargo carriers so popular with local Outback owners. Sure, it's a bit heavy and the lack of paint reduced its lifespan, but it got the job done. The skinny twine holding the box to its plumbing-pipe mounts looks a bit scary; I'd hoped to see some hefty lag-bolts going through the roof's metal into the box's underside, but did not find any such hardware. Tailgating this rig would not have been advised.  Inside, a sturdy wooden floor covers the rear-seat and cargo area. Just the thing for lots of bicycle parts or camping gear!.  It's those little details that make an installation like this work best.  A tire receipt from last year shows that this car lived in even-more-Subariffic-than-Denver Boulder, and that it was still running and being maintained in the recent past.  Unlike nearly all retired Subarus of this era that I see in Denver junkyards, this one has not a single cannabis-dispensary sticker on the dash (in stark contrast to, for example, this THC-saturated '84 GL wagon). None of that lung-capacity-destroying weed for this Subaru, no sir\u2014 just healthy outdoor adventures!.  You could still buy front-wheel-drive Subarus in 1992, but this one is an all-wheel-drive car with 5-speed manual transmission and 90-horse boxer-four engine.  Before Subaru pitched their wagons as outdoor-activity-enabling adventuremobiles, they were sold as practical family haulers.

VActress Parul Yadav, who is all set to be seen in the Kannada remake of the 2014 Bollywood film "Queen", says she treasures all the movies she has done till date. "'Queen' is definitely a milestone in Indian cinema and I am excited to be a part of it but I treasure all the movies I have done till date, as those movies are what made me what I am today," Yadav told IANS over e-mail from Paris. The actress is currently shooting for the remake titled "Butterfly" in Paris and will be seen reprising the role of Rani, which was essayed by Kangana Ranaut in the Vikas Bahl directorial. Parul hopes to be a part of many more path-breaking films. "So, I believe all the films were of utmost importance to me and I am hoping to be a part of many more great movies," she said. Will "Butterfly" have a strong hold in the Kannada film industry like "Queen"? "Yes definitely! The story is universal and something everyone can relate to," she said. Parul feels happy that a lot of remakes are being made in Indian cinema. "I think great stories need to be told in as many languages as possible and it's irrelevant who tells the story first. The point is to put the story across and inspire," she said. Parul made her acting debut with the 2004 Tamil film "Dreams" starring Dhanush and Diya. Since then, she has featured in several Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil movies. Television actress Hina Khan, who is currently featuring in the 11th season of "Bigg Boss", made a sly comment saying "fat and bulging" are the requirements for the South film industry. Asked her opinion on the same, Parul said: "May be that's her thought process. Well, I am an actress down south and I don't have a bulging and voluptuous figure, that pretty much clarifies the statement.".

VThe show is aptly titled \u201cThe Appearance Of That Which Cannot Be Seen\u201d and examines the influences that spurs the photographer at a creative level. One can see how Linke has recognized that fine line that demarcates fiction from reality by using various contemporary image processing technologies that set the filmmaker and photographer\u2019s work apart. His focus in his practice has been to amplify the implications of photographic archives and how they manifest in their respective forms. Linke also keenly studies the binding factors that coexist between architectural, spatial and urban functions and how human beings respond to these environments. Through his work he defies many set conventional norms of photography. He also has this urge to understand how installation is becoming increasingly popular for the display of photography and when artists of different mediums collectively come together to display their works it paves way for a new enlightening discourse. So, when curators, art historians, designers, architects converge for a common purpose the event becomes all the more significant and encompassing. The exhibit opens with a conversation with the photographer moderated by Joerg Bader, Director of the Geneva Center for Photography.

VAt the EICMA show, Lambretta had displayed some of its models-V50 Special, V125 Special and V200 Special. The Indian market will receive Lambretta scooters a year later in 2019. The popular Lambretta scooter from the 1990s is set to make a comeback in India. It is indeed one of the oldest and most known brands in the scooter space that was assembled here from 1950s to 1990s under license from the brand. After a long lull, the brand showed up this year at the 2017 EICMA Motor Show held in Milan. It is revealed that the company will first venture into the European market sometime next year with its range of scooters that will be manufactured in Taiwan. The Indian market on the other hand will receive Lambretta scooters a year later in 2019. At the EICMA show, Lambretta had displayed some of its models-V50 Special, V125 Special and V200 Special. Interestingly, the company will make a comeback with these models followed by other vehicles later in the future. . All the three scooters will share the same underpinnings and will have similar dimensions. The V50 will be the smallest and will receive a 49.5cc, air-cooled, carburetted, single-cylinder engine with 3.5bhp at 7,500rpm against 3.4Nm of torque. On the other hand, the V125 will draw power from the 124.7cc, fuel-injected unit good for 10.1bhp at 8,500rpm against 9.2Nm torque at 7,000rpm. While the V200 will be a premium model and will propel on a 168.9cc, fuel-injected engine tuned to produce 12.1bhp of maximum power at 7,500rpm and 12.5Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. . In terms of equipment, all the V Specials will sport a LED headlamp and turn signals. Additionally, the telescopic suspension set up will be standard and Lambretta will equip 220mm hydraulic disc front brake and 110mm drum unit at rear on all three models. Another standard bit on all the models will be a 12V charging socket, seen in most of new-age scooters. . Reports in media indicate that the owner of Lambretta, Innoceti S.A is in the process of acquiring distribution in India and could also contemplate manufacturing as well as assembling scooters in India. One must note that no official announcement has come on the same from the manufacturer, though we will update our readers as soon as more information is revealed.

VWhat is Legionnaires' disease?.  (CNN)Disneyland Park has shut down two cooling towers at its park in Southern California following an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. Orange County health officials said nine people who visited the Anaheim theme park in September developed the disease.  An additional three people who had been to Anaheim but not Disneyland got sick too, said Jessica Good, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency. One patient, who had not visited the park and had additional health issues, died, she said. .  The 12 patients are between ages 52 and 94, and 10 were hospitalized, she said. . CNN has reached out to Disneyland for comment but has not heard back. . "To date, no additional Legionella cases have been identified with potential exposure in Anaheim after September," Good said. "There is no known ongoing risk associated with this outbreak.". Legionnaires disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, sometimes found in water systems. It is typically contracted by breathing mist from the water that contains it. The source of the mist can be air conditioning units in large facilities, showers or hot tubs. Legionnaires' disease is not contagious between humans. County health officials identified Disneyland Park as a common location of eight of the cases last month, and have been working to identify potential sources, Good said. Disneyland Park informed health officials this month that elevated levels of Legionella had been identified in two of its 18 towers, which were then treated and disinfected. . Disneyland took the towers out of service on November 1 and told the health agency it had performed additional disinfecting and testing. It brought the towers back into service November 5, but two days later, they were taken out of service again,she said. . Health officials subsequently issued an order that the towers remain shut down until they are verified to be free from contamination. The results of the tests will not be known for about two weeks. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report .

VGarton has played nine first-class games so far, picking up 23 wickets at 36.47. George Garton has been included in the England Ashes side ahead of the Ashes, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed on Saturday (November 11). The left-arm pacer will join the squad as cover for Jake Ball. Ball sprained his ankle in the warm-up tie against Cricket Australia XI. The pacer was in his fourth over when he collapsed during his delivery stride, his ankle seemingly buckling as it hit the ground. Scans have confirmed ligament damage and Ball has been sidelined for at least a week. Garton has played nine first-class games so far, picking up 23 wickets at 36.47 and caught the eye of the think-tank during the England net sessions. "The England medical team will assess the injury over the next seven days and he will play no further part in the Adelaide match," a statement from the visiting side said. "National selectors have called up England Lions and Sussex left-arm seamer George Garton as cover in Townsville for the final warm-up match.". England have been struggling with injury woes ahead of the all-important tour and have already lost Steven Finn to a knee injury. Moeen Ali continues to recover from the side strain and hasn't play a part in the tour games yet. The side has already included Tom Curran as replacement for Finn. © Cricbuzz.

VArundhati Bhattacharya.  \u201cYou should love your job; you must be a person who is passionate about what you are doing,\u201d former SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has advised bank employees here. .  Interacting with employees of Vijaya Bank after delivering Mulki Sunder Ram Shetty Memorial Lecture organised by the bank recently, Bhattacharya told working women: \u201cYou must really love what you do. Now by that I don\u2019t mean that you should neglect everything else. I keep telling all my people that if you are a good worker you should also be a good home maker.\u201d .  Discouraging women from quitting, she said: \u201cGiving up is so easy; it is a matter of writing that I am resigning. Love what you are doing; if you don\u2019t love what you are doing, please do give up and do something else that you love.\u201d .  \u201cYou can\u2019t be a good worker and a bad home maker; it does not happen. I constantly keep saying that giving up is a matter of a few minutes, and not giving up and hanging in there might take more courage, but if you do it, you will find that things work out somehow or the other.\u201d .  Sharing her experience, Bhattacharya said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s divine intervention or something else \u2014 somewhere or the other solutions present themselves to you. Especially for women, the impetus is very strong to give up; just hang in there, because if you hang in there, things are sure to work out.\u201d .

V(NASA). Scientists have made a bizarre discovery - a star that refuses to stop shining, despite exploding multiple times over a period of more than 50 years. Supernovae, the explosions of stars, have been observed in the thousands and in all cases they marked the death of a star. "The spectra we obtained at Keck Observatory showed that this supernova looked like nothing we had ever seen before. This, after discovering nearly 5,000 supernovae in the last two decades," said Peter Nugent, Senior Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US. "While the spectra bear a resemblance to normal hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova explosions, they grew brighter and dimmer at least five times more slowly, stretching an event which normally lasts 100 days to over two years," said Nugent. The supernova, named iPTF14hls, was discovered in September 2014. At the time, it looked like an ordinary supernova. Several months later, astronomers at Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) in the US noticed the supernova was growing brighter again after it had faded. When astronomers went back and looked at archival data, they were astonished to find evidence of an explosion in 1954 at the same location. This star somehow survived that explosion and exploded again in 2014. "This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work. It is the biggest puzzle I have encountered in almost a decade of studying stellar explosions," said Iair Arcavi, a NASA Einstein postdoctoral fellow at LCO. . The study, published in the journal Nature, calculated that the star that exploded was at least 50 times more massive than the Sun and probably much larger. Supernova iPTF14hls may have been the most massive stellar explosion ever seen, researchers said. The size of this explosion could be the reason that our conventional understanding of the death of stars failed to explain this event, they said. .

VPHOTO: File. The Sindh government has annulled the results of an entry test for government medical colleges conducted by the National Testing Service (NTS) last month. The provincial government notified on Saturday that the results were cancelled on the recommendation of a five-member committee, formed by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to investigate allegations of irregularities in the test. The government directed the administration of the Dow University Health Sciences (DUHS) to conduct the entry test again within the next 15 days, in transparent way. A probe was launched after a questionnaire of the pre-admission test was leaked on October 21, a day before the exams, allegedly in connivance with the NTS staff to mint money. The Sindh High Court issued notices to the NTS chairperson, the Higher Education Commission and provincial health authorities over the matter earlier this month. The petitioner said the leaking of the test paper a day before the exam amounted to the murder of merit. He alleged that the government had not taken action against the NTS staff for such an unlawful act. The petitioner\u2019s lawyer argued that the NTS test held on October 22 may be declared illegal after the paper was leaked. He also sought directives for the government to hold the entry test afresh through a reputed testing agency for admission to MBBS and BDS college and university programmes. The court was also pleaded to restrain the NTS from issuing a final merit list of the October 22 exam till the final disposal of the petition.

The drivers of the passenger vehicles blame the private cars for the traffic mess while the drivers of the private vehicles say that the passenger vehicles move at a sluggish pace in order to fill their capacity.  The commuters say that several vehicles are parked haphazardly in the markets, which makes the passage of other vehicles difficult. The people blamed that personnel of traffic department do not control the traffic on the road due to which passengers are stuck for long hours. They face difficulties in reaching their offices and workplaces. The students and teachers are particularly facing the brunt of these snarls as they report the educational institutions quite late. The people appealed to the authorities to take cognizance of the issue and deploy manpower to tide over the situation at a time when the duration of days has drastically reduced.

V Are you in your early teens and have started drinking? Avoid doing so, as researchers claimed to have found that alcohol use among early adolescents may lead to insomnia. "These findings indicate that insomnia may be a unique risk marker for alcohol use among young adolescents," said Naomi Marmorstein, professor at Rutgers University-Camden in the US. The researcher examined the associations between alcohol use and sleep-related issues on seventh and eighth grade students. When sleep problems were found to be associated with frequency of alcohol use, the researcher examined whether symptoms of mental health problems or levels of parental monitoring accounted for these associations. The study, published in the Journal Addictive Behaviours, examined the development of mental health problems and resilience among at-risk youth. The participants of the study completed questionnaires that asked how long it took for them to fall asleep, what times they usually went to bed on a weekday and on the weekend or vacation night, how often they experienced sleep disturbances and whether they ever fell asleep in class or had trouble staying awake after school. They were also asked the frequency of any alcohol use in the previous four months. The researcher determined that symptoms of mental health problems and parental monitoring did not account for the link between insomnia and alcohol use. Overall, there were associations between alcohol and both insomnia and daytime sleepiness. "Parents, educators and therapists should consider insomnia to be a risk marker for alcohol use and alcohol use a risk marker for insomnia, among early adolescents," said Marmorstein.

VUpset Hindus are urging Charlotte (North Carolina) based fashion activewear company \u201cGearBunch\u201d for immediate withdrawal of leggings, capris and bedding carrying images of Hindu deity Lord Ganesha; calling it highly inappropriate. Distinguished Hindu statesman Rajan Zed, in a statement in Nevada today, said that Lord Ganesha was highly revered in Hinduism and was meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to adorn one\u2019s legs or to be slept upon. Inappropriate usage of Hindu deities or concepts for commercial or other agenda was not okay as it hurt the devotees. Zed, who is President of Universal Society of Hinduism, also urged GearBunch and its CEO to also offer a formal apology; besides withdrawing Lord Ganesha leggings, capris and bedding. Hinduism was the oldest and third largest religion of the world with about 1.1 billion adherents and a rich philosophical thought and it should not be taken frivolously. Symbols of any faith, larger or smaller, should not be mishandled, Rajan Zed noted. Zed further said that such trivialization of Hindu deities was disturbing to the Hindus world over. Hindus were for free artistic expression and speech as much as anybody else if not more. But faith was something sacred and attempts at trivializing it hurt the followers, Zed added. GearBunch, which claims to \u201ccombine fashion with activewear\u201d, specializes in \u201cwomen\u2019s workout leggings\u201d and offers \u201chand made\u201d in USA \u201call day activewear\u201d. Its mission includes \u201ctrendy products for the bold, style aware global girl, who always pushes the boundaries, works hard, plays harder, looks amazing, and believes in herself\u201d. Lord Ganesha leggings, capris and bedding set are priced at $87.99, $79.99 and $189 respectively. In Hinduism, Lord Ganesha is worshipped as god of wisdom and remover of obstacles and is invoked before the beginning of any major undertaking. There are about three million Hindus in USA.

Both the films dealt in romantic genres and garnered rave reviews from the critics. But unfortunately, they have failed to make it big at the box office. On day 1, \u2018Qarib Qarib Singlle\u2019 managed to rake in approximately Rs 1.65-1.75 crore nett at the box office while \u2018Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana\u2019 minted only Rs 60-65 lakh nett. Even though \u2018Qarib Qarib Singlle\u2019 is racing ahead of the other film, the collections are not as good as expected. (Also Read: Qarib Qarib Singlle movie review: An enjoyable, refreshing and light-hearted journey). Apart from these two, another film that released this Friday was South star Siddharth\u2019s horror-thriller \u2018The House Next Door\u2019. It managed to get good reviews from the critics, but it looks like it failed to make money at the box office. Let\u2019s wait and watch, what the weekends hold for these films.

VGanguly however feels Dhoni has a lot of cricket left in him, especially in the One-dayers. Kolkata, Nov 12 () Former India captain Sourav Ganguly today advised the under-fire World Cup winning skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to approach the Twenty20 Internationals "differently". A few former India cricketers, including Ajit Agarkar and VVS Laxman, recently raised questions about Dhoni's T20 future, creating a storm in the country's cricketing circles. "His record in T20I is not that good compared to ODIs. Hope Kohli and team management will speak to him separately. He has immense ability. If he approaches T20Is differently, then he will be successful," said Ganguly. Chasing 197 in second T20 versus New Zealand in Rajkot, India were struggling at 97 for four when Dhoni joined skipper Virat Kohli and found it difficult to get it going. Eventually India lost the match. Ganguly however feels Dhoni has a lot of cricket left in him, especially in the One-dayers. "Definitely not for One-dayers. I think he should keep playing One-day cricket, but he has to play differently in T20Is. He has to play T20Is freely. It depends on the selectors and how they would like to play him," Ganguly said here on the sidelines of a TV shoot. Ganguly expressed surprise at India opting to rest all- rounder Hardik Pandya for the upcoming Test series. "I'm surprised. I don't know if he's injured. He has played only three Tests... This is the age to play. I don't know the exact reason. Hope he's fit. "India won't play with three spinners, definitely not at the Eden Gardens as the pitch here is different. They will play with two spinners and now since they don't have Hardik Pandya they may have a different combination for the all- rounders slot.". Ganguly hoped Sri Lanka would give India fight after their confidence-boosting 2-0 win over Pakistan in the Test series last month. "Of course India are the favourites. They are a much better side than Sri Lanka. Recently they won in Sri Lanka across all formats.   "I hope it won't be a one-sided series. The recent (limited overs) series against New Zealand was competitive. Hope Sri Lanka will play well," he said.  .

VThe Nokia 8 is all set to get upgraded to Oreo soon, with the brand\u2019s Chief Product Officer Juho Sarvikas announcing the news via his Twitter account. The handset was first unveiled back in August this year, the same month as Android 8.0\u2019s official release. It\u2019s now 3 months later, a fairly quick turnaround for a company as new as Nokia. Most firms take many more months or even an entire year to upgrade its goods. HMD Global has been heavily marketing the pure Android aspect of its smartphones, so it\u2019s good to see it\u2019s not backing down from its promises about regular updates. HMD Global had actually announced a Nokia phones beta labs program just last month. The Nokia 8 is the first handset to be part of the initiative, allowing any owner to apply to be a beta tester and check out Android 8.0 ahead of everyone else. Sarvikas highlighted the positive feedback Nokia has gotten from participants in a short video. Most people have given it pretty glowing reviews, noting that it hasn\u2019t given them any problems and they haven\u2019t detected any bugs. He didn\u2019t mention any dates in his post, but it should be fairly soon if there really weren\u2019t any major issues with the public beta. The tweet also reveals that over 2000 users have tried out Oreo on their Nokia 8 units. Once the rollout is complete, HMD Global plans to focus on the rest of its lineup namely the Nokia 2, Nokia 3, Nokia 5, Nokia 6, and Nokia 7. You can join the Nokia phones beta labs program here. .

VLONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices were on track for their first weekly rise in a month on Friday after uncertainty over U.S. tax reform pushed stock markets lower and weakened the dollar, making bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies. Spot gold was flat at $1,284.58 an ounce at 1451 GMT but up 1.2 percent this week after touching $1,288.34 on Thursday, its highest since Oct. 20. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were 0.2 percent lower at $1,285. The dollar was set for its first weekly fall since early October after U.S. Republican senators said they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate in 2019, later than the House's proposed schedule of 2018, complicating a push for the biggest overhaul of U.S. tax law since the 1980s. . Uncertainty over the tax plans also hit U.S. stock markets and helped end the longest run of global share price gains since 2003. . Rising share prices have dampened demand for gold by offering better returns, but some worry that a correction is overdue. Further share price falls would likely increase the price of gold, seen as a safe investment in times of uncertainty, said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. But a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields on Friday limited gains by reducing the attractiveness of non-yielding bullion. . "Rising bond yields are not good for gold," said Hansen. "But the market will be more focused on the risk of a potential stock market correction than the risk of higher yields.". On the technical side, Fibonacci resistance was at $1,297.70 with support at the 200-day moving average at $1,263.40, said analysts at ScotiaMocatta. Gold prices were unlikely to fall if they could remain above a Fibonacci level of $1,283.50, they said. In other precious metals, silver was up 0.2 percent at $17.02 an ounce and on track for a 1.3 percent gain this week, its first weekly rise in four weeks. Platinum was 0.2 percent higher at $938.60 an ounce after hitting $939.90, the highest since Oct. 16. It was set for a weekly gain of 2.2 percent. Palladium was down 1 percent at $1,000.25 an ounce after touching its highest since 2001 at $1,026.10 on Thursday and was up 0.3 percent this week.

V Representational image. Sulaimaniyah (Iraq): A strong earthquake that shook the Iran-Iraq border region has killed at least 13 people, authorities and state media in the two countries said. The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.3 temblor was centred 30 kilometres southwest of Halabja, near the northeastern border with Iran. In Iraq, officials said the quake had killed six people in Sulaimaniyah province and injured around 150. "Four people were killed by the earthquake" in Darbandikhan, the town's mayor Nasseh Moulla Hassan told AFP. Another two people were killed in Kalar, according to the director of the hospital in the town about 70 kilometres south of Darbandikhan. Iranian state media reported seven people had died in the quake. "According to the latest toll, six people were killed in Qasr-e Shirin and one in Azgaleh," Kermanshah province governor Houshang Bazvand told the ISNA news agency. State television had previously reported six dead in Qasr-e Shirin, close to the Iraqi border, around 40 kilometres southwest of Azgaleh. Both agencies reported 25 people had been wounded. The quake struck the mountainous area of Sulaimaniyah province at 9:18 pm (local time) at a depth of 25 kilometres, the monitor said. It was felt for about 20 seconds in Baghdad, and sometimes for longer in other provinces of Iraq, AFP journalists said. In the province of Sulaimaniyah, located in Iraq's Kurdistan region, residents ran out onto the streets at the time of the quake and some minor property damage was recorded, an AFP reporter said. In Iran, ISNA said the earthquake was felt in several cities in the west of the country including Tabriz. In southeastern Turkey, the earthquake was felt "from Malatya to Van", an AFP correspondent said. In the town of Diyarbakir, residents also left their homes before returning. The quake took place along a 1,500 kilometre fault line between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates, a belt extending through western Iran and into northeastern Iraq, the US Geological Survey said. A 5.7 magnitude earthquake near Iran's border with Turkmenistan in May killed two people, injured hundreds and caused widespread damage, state media reported. The last major earthquake to strike Iran was a 2003 tremor in Bam, in the southeastern province of Kerman, which killed at least 31,000 people and flattened the city. (AFP).

Iranian state TV also said Iraqi officials reported at least six people dead inside Iraq, along with more than 50 people injured in Sulaymaniyah province and about 150 in Khanaquin city. No reports were immediately available from Iraq\u2019s government. Koulivand earlier told a local television station that the earthquake knocked out electricity in Iran\u2019s western cities of Mehran and Ilam. He also said 35 rescue teams were providing assistance.

V Chennai: It would be disastrous if actors enter politics just because they are popular, said actor and Tamil Film Producers' Council vice president Prakash Raj on Sunday. .  Asked if he would support actors like Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan if they entered politics, Prakash Raj said that he will vote as a responsible citizen and not as a fan. The National Award winner also clarified that he will not enter politics. .  "Actors who come to politics must have a clear perception of the issues facing the country and win the trust of the people," said Prakash Raj while addressing reporters in Bengaluru. .  The 52-year-old actor has been questioning the BJP-led central government on demonetisation and "silencing" of artists since last week through Twitter. In an interview earlier, the actor had said that national politics should be kept out of Tamil Nadu. "Before I vote, I look at the promises made by a party in the manifesto and what solutions it proposes to solve pressing issues." .  Prakash Raj said that he is awaiting Kamal Haasan's manifesto before he can decide on whether to vote for him or not. .  The 'Singham' star said, "If one wants to rule Tamil Nadu, he must be known to its people. He should have lived here 20-30 years and understood the local problems. National parties are only interested in encroaching on the state territory. They are not concerned about the issues concerning the state." .  The 'Iruvar' actor also added that Rajinikanth who has lived in Tamil Nadu for more than 40 years is more a 'Tamil' than a 'Kannadiga'. .

VThis committed spray-tan fan tried to DIY it for the first time. . Photograph courtesy of Amanda Becker. With less time and more stress, we've all been outsourcing our beauty routines. But it's costing us something more valuable than money: the confidence and sense of control that comes with owning our own rituals. So with pro tips as their guide, four WH staffers tried to re-create their favorite treatments at home. Next up: Self-tanning. The tester: Amanda, Web designer. "I get a spray tan every two months or so. I'm used to having to strike weird poses in the booth to make sure the mist covers every inch; at home, I also had to contort my body to reach certain spots. The hardest parts for me to get were my sides and my back. I really had to stretch, but it didn't wind up streaky, to my surprise. The tan dried quickly to a beautiful golden color. The results were subtler than in the booth, so I would probably need to build up the color or use a darker hue next time.". THE PRO TIPS: Courtesy of Kristyn Padras, New York City spray tanner. The day before you self-tan, remove dead skin cells by using body wash mixed with a superfine sugar scrub. (Or try this Sand Red Mineral Face + Body Polish from the Women's Health Boutique.). To prevent tanner from pooling in lines on your hands and feet, apply a basic moisturizer before the tanner. Moisturize again post-glow, blending out excess between fingers with a pointed makeup sponge, moving in the direction of your fingertips.

VNagpur: Gone are the days when children were left to their fate and surroundings to grow and schools were their only learning centres. With changing of times, parents today are becoming increasingly aware about the need to enrol their children for offbeat programmes. The city too has several avenues to offer them. It was 43 years ago when artist Chandrakant Channe, who had earned a doctorate in Children Expression, left Mumbai to start the Basoli group in Nagpur. The group, comprising children of all ages, was established to encourage painting among them. Over the years, a gamut of activities including sculpture, dance and drama are also performed. "The idea is not to turn children into artists but to make them artistic," said Channe. "The group has created murals for Suresh Bhat auditorium as well as a cancer hospital in the city," he added. Channe recently organized a story board workshop in the city.  Inspire Book Club in Pratap Nagar was originally started for adults to read and talk about their novels in front of a gathering. This club soon started attracting children with most of the sessions dedicated only to the tots. "The concept helps children to speak for ten to fifteen minutes about their book in front of people with confidence. Seeing them, newer children get inspired. It broadens their reading spectrum and makes them feel good about themselves," said Dr Prachi Raj, who started the club with Sheetal Dhopte nearly three years ago. This time, the club's children's day meet is to be held on November 18. City's facilitators Arti Bhandari and Nikita Shah recently started a platform for dance movement therapy and expressive arts for creative learning to understand children's baggage and vulnerabilities and help them release it. The duo is working to help people understand the psychology and the direction of thinking of the child. Helen O'Grady, an international after-school drama programme, which uses theatre and other activities to bring out communication and presentation skills of children, operates through at least three franchises in the city. To help children grow through the medium of an open art space, the Vikamshi's started 'Alag Angle' catering to children aged three to adults of all ages. Twelve years down the line, the initiative has been instrumental in exposing children to lots of activities and ideas. This year at their annual art exhibition 'Alive', several children participated in making paintings out of seed papers. "We aim to increase their observation power and ignite curiosity by introducing and connecting them to different mediums like wood or paper among other things. This also helps to eliminate their fear," said co-founder Tanul Vikamshi, adding that the parents too are becoming increasingly aware about the need to have different learning platforms.

As stated by Mashable, the issue was raised by a Reddit user and several others chimed in saying they too have experienced the similar problem. "I've noticed that my iPhone X screen becomes very unresponsive as soon as I step outside. It literally takes 2 seconds from going inside to the cold outdoors and my screen stops being very responsive. I try swiping on websites and it doesn't register my finger. It's very noticeable,\u201d user reported. However, Apple says that it is aware of the issue and is planning a software update to fix the issue in the coming days. \u201cWe are aware of instances where the iPhone X screen will become temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment. After several seconds the screen will become fully responsive again. This will be addressed in an upcoming software update,\u201d Apple told The Loop. \u201ciPhones, iPads, and the iPod touch are only built to run at ambient temperatures between 32 and 95 Fahrenheit. Going beyond those limits can cause a device to "change its behaviour to regulate its temperature," the company said. There are also reports about a green line appearing on iPhone X's screen. Some users have claimed that it does not go away when the phone is shut off or restored.

VHere is the latest batch of spy shots of the next generation Mercedes CLS, which is due for launch in 2018. The car is gradually losing its camouflage. Design-wise, the change from the current to the new generation is more evolutionary than revolutionary \u2013 even though the pronounced hip of the current generation will be eliminated for the new model and the new taillights will be horizontal rather than diagonal. . More news under the bonnet: out go the known V6 engines and in will be in-line sixes \u2013 and the noisy 2.1-litre four-cylinder turbodiesels will be replaced by more refined and less thirsty 2-litre units. Like in the new E-class, drivers of the CLS will be looking at two displays, the one in front of the wheel being a freely programmable one. Mercedes invented the niche of four-door coupes in 2004. The CLS Shooting Brake of 2012 was an attempt to make the segment even more attractive but lead to a failure. The new generation CLS will therefore be available as a four-door coupe only \u2013 an estate is not in the pipeline. .

VAgra: Jal Nigam has planned to increase efficiency of city sewage treatment plants after central government amended the policy for treating waste water. As per the revised norms, sewage with Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) above 30 ml per litre will not be considered suitably treated.  A senior Jal Nigam official said, \u201cCentral government has made it clear that after being treated sewage should have BOD less than 30 ml per litre. For this, major mechanical up-gradations are needed to raise efficiency of sewage treatment plants. Earlier, there were no specific directions in this regard.\u201d.  However, it will be a challenge for Jal Nigam to comply with revised norms.  According to sources, earlier this year the civic body had expressed discontent with Jal Nigam concerning poor state of functioning of city sewage treatment facilities. Not a single sewage treatment plant (STP) out of the seven was working to full capacity. The situation continues to remain dismal.  Before 1995, said Jal Nigam officials, domestic sewage directly flowed into river Yamuna via a network of drains. To check increasing pollution in the river, a plan to set up STPs was made in 1996. In 2001, three plants were developed at Dhandupura 1, Pilikhar and Nagla Budi. Nine sewage pumping stations (SPS) were also established.  The total capacity of the STP at that time was 90.25 million liters per day (MLD). By 2010, as the city expanded and population increased, two more STPs of 26 MLD total capacity were developed at Jagnpur and Devri road. STP Bichpuri and Dhandupura 2 having a total capacity of 64 MLD were set up in 2013. With that, the total capacity of seven STPs in Agra is 180.25 MLD.  As per the estimate in comparison to the total capacity of the STPs, only 100 MLD sewage is treated on regular basis as the all the sewer pumping stations are not functioning.  Previous reports of Jal Nigam\u2019s Yamuna Pollution Unit also highlights fact that no STP out of seven is working on its full capacity. A majority of the STPs are working on less capacity by up to 15 \u2013 80%. Condition of Devri road, Bichpuri and Dhandupura 2 STP is worst.

VNew Delhi [India], November 11 (ANI): The Supreme Court had appointed former football captain Bhaskar Ganguly as ombudsman, says All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday. A statement from the AIFF stated that, the apex court also appointed S Y Qureshi, former Chief Election Commissioner of India, who has also served as Secretary in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India as the ombudsmen to formulate the AIFF Constitution within eight weeks. Meanwhile, the top court stayed the order of the Delhi High Court allowing all AIFF elected committees to function on a regular basis. Yesterday, the apex court had refused to stay the High Court's order of setting aside the election of NCP leader Praful Patel as the president of the sports' governing body. Earlier, the AIFF had approached the Supreme Court and sought a stay on the Delhi High Court's October 31 order, which had also appointed former Chief Election Commissioner S Y Quraishi as the administrator of the governing body. On October 31, the High Court had set aside the election of Praful Patel as the president of the AIFF and called for fresh elections within five months asserting that National Sports Code was not followed during previous elections. Following the verdict, the AIFF had said in a statement, "AIFF is not aware of the reasons of the Delhi High Court to pass this order. Once AIFF receives the copy of the Order from the High Court, AIFF will decide the course of action in accordance with the law.". The AIFF statement, which was issued hours after the Delhi High Court's decision, had read that the court has directed to amend the AIFF Constitution to make it compliant with the National Sports Code. The statement had also informed that the AIFF had approached the court and filed a detailed affidavit to bring on record that it has followed the election process as prescribed under Sports Code, its constitution as well FIFA and AFC statutes. Patel has been the president of India's association football governing body AIFF since 2012. In December 2016, he was re-elected unopposed as the president for the third time. The 2016 elections were made after the lower court vacated a stay on the elections of the national sports body for alleged non-adherence to the Sports Code.(ANI).

V DEHRADUN: As many as 123 institutions of higher education which are deemed to be universities have been directed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to refrain from using the word 'university' in their names. .  In a circular issued on November 10, a copy of which is with TOI, UGC secretary PK Thakur citing a Supreme Court order dated November 3, has directed the heads of these institutes that they should "restrain from using the word 'university' within one month from today." "Instead, the institution may mention the word 'deemed to be university' within parenthesis. .  Failure to do so will invite necessary action against the deemed to be university in accordance with the UGC (lnstitutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2016," the circular says. .  Among the list of institutions which have been sent the directive are the Delhi-based Indian Agricultural Research Institute (Pusa), Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and Jamia Hamdard. .  Other institutions on the list include the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, BIT Mesra (Ranchi), Christ University, Bengaluru, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, Symbiosis International University, Pune, BITS Pilani, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izzatnagar (UP), Graphic Era University, Dehradun and Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar among others. .  Through the circular, the institutions have also been told that "in those cases where the government's notification is with the word 'university', the deemed to be university may submit a proposal with an alternative name (without using the word 'university') to the UGC/ministry of HRD so that necessary amendment can be made by MHRD." The institutions have been asked to ensure compliance "within 15 days from receipt of the letter." .  Reacting to the circular, the representatives of most of the institutions approached by TOI claimed that they were already using "deemed to be university" in their names. .  R K Singh, director of Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) situated in Izatnagar, Bareilly, said, "UGC's order will have no impact on IVRI as we do not use the word 'university' in our name since the beginning because our research institute is more important than the varsity. .  For academic-related work, we mention IVRI and use the phrase 'deemed to be university' in brackets." .

V  VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) is preparing the ground for introducing heli-tourism services on a pilot basis in the city after having obtained a key approval from Eastern Naval Command (ENC) of the Indian Navy. However, the Navy has allowed VUDA to operate the helitourism service only for seven days within a 30-day period between November 15 and December 14. .  The VUDA will need the approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) if it wishes to keep project running beyond that, sources said. VUDA officials said they would write to Pawan Hans, leading helicopter service company, to launch the service and also seek approval of DGCA for full-fledged operations . .  A trail run of Pawan Hans helicopter was conducted on October 26 and it covered major tourist attractions in the city such as Erra Matti Dibbalu, Thotlakonda, and Bheemili among others. Navy officials tracked these routes using global positioning system (GPS) to prepare a report on the helitourism project. VUDA vice-chairman P Basanth Kumar said they would request the CM N Chandrababu Naidu to launch the service in the city. The cost for a 10-minute ride is Rs 2,500. Based on the demand, chopper service will likely to be extended to the Araku valley . .

VRemember when we told you that the highlighter trend was here to stay long time? Well, it seems like the makeup Gods were listening in and thought it had enjoyed enough time in the spotlight, because now, there\u2019s another makeup product that\u2019s getting some well deserved attention\u2014blush! For centuries, blush has been synonymous with cherubic pink cheeks that add a healthy glow to the skin. However, this time around the good girl blush has got a much edgier upgrade thanks to the yellow blush makeup trend. Whimsically tinted cheeks have been working their way up the popularity charts for a while now. But it was RiRi\u2019s epic pink cheekbones that finally thrust this trend into the limelight. Yellow blush, the brand new makeup trend we\u2019re talking about, is a chip off the same block. Now we know that yellow can seem like a rather unusual makeup choice in one\u2019s kit, let alone one\u2019s cheeks, but that didn\u2019t stop a bunch of lively makeup artists from going wild with the sunshine shade and dolling up their cheekbones with it. Just like the many eccentric beauty trends in the past, yellow blush caught on with Instagram\u2019s beauty community rather quickly. Post after post showcased this fiery makeup trend in all its glory, and vivid cheeks worn with winged eyeliner, pink lips and even yellow eye liner became a rage on social media. While yellow blush may not be the makeup trend to wear when you head to work in the morning (really though, we\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t!), it can certainly look fierce when sported in photoshoots and editorials. If you\u2019d like to sport a toned down version of this trend, try these makeup tricks. First opt for a yellow eyeshadow. Since it isn\u2019t a popular shade of blush just yet, the powdery matte consistency of eyeshadow should do the trick. When applying it to the apples of your cheeks, dab just a dash and blend it outwards well so that it has a translucent final finish.

V It did not go quietly into the night: An exploding star left behind an echo of light, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.  In a sequence of images captured over the course of two years, Hubble scientists tracked a ring of light as it appeared to expand outward into space. This light came from an initial stellar explosion \u2014 which was first identified three years ago \u2014 reflecting off a nearby gas cloud, according to a statement from the Space Telescope Science Institute's Hubble site. A series of images showing the expanding ring of light from supernova SN 2014J, reflecting off a gas cloud, from a stellar explosion.  "Voices reverberating off mountains and the sound of footsteps bouncing off walls are examples of an echo," the statement said. "Space has its own version of an echo. It's not made with sound, but with light and occurs when light bounces off dust clouds." [The Hubble Telescope's 10 Most Amazing Discoveries]. A series of images (top) shows the light echo from a supernova, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. The larger image shows the location of the supernova (marked by a crosshairs), in the galaxy M82.  The initial explosion was a supernova called SN 2014J, discovered on Jan. 21, 2014, in the nearby galaxy M82, located 11.4 million light-years away from Earth. Stars larger than the sun turn into supernovas when they run out of fuel, leading to a chain reaction of energetic events including the explosion of material.  "So far, astronomers have spotted only 15 light echoes around supernovae outside our Milky Way galaxy," according to the statement.

VRepresentative image.  MANALI: Officials of Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP), which is a world heritage site, plan to use camera traps to keep an eye on poachers, who often target rare species. Most of the cases of poaching come to the fore during winter months when higher regions experience snowfall and animals descend to lower areas. .  The national park is home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna and several rare species like snow leopard, Himalayan bear, Himalayan tahr, musk deer, blue sheep, monal and western tragopan are found here. The park is spread over a vast area in Kullu valley and majority of it experiences snowfall in winter months. The wildlife comes down to lower areas in search of food and water where poachers target them. The park authorities use camera traps to record the activities of both wildlife as well as the poachers. This time, the department has marked places to establish dozens of such cameras. .  Park director RS Patyal said the cameras would be established before the snowfall. "We have noticed illegal activities inside the park. Cameras will not only take pictures of the poachers but also of animals, which will help us in study of the species. The hidden cameras would be brought back to collect data after the snow melts," he said. .   Patyal added that the ground staff would increase patrolling in the park during winter months and the process was likely to take many days. "I went on patrolling from October 23 to 27. We started the trek from Ropa in Sainj valley to Sairopa in Tirthan valley. We noticed illegal extraction of medicinal herbs as well. Our patrolling will continue throughout the winter season," he said. .  It becomes difficult for officials to track poachers and probe case in absence of evidences. The photos captured by the cameras would become evidence against those involved in the illegal activities. A few years ago the department had lodged a complaint against a poacher, who was captured on camera carrying a gun. .  Many people kill monal, western tragopan, blue sheep and other wildlife for meat. Residents of Shakti and Maror, the villages inside the park, also used to kill animals but they had surrendered their arms to the authorities in January 2014 and had promised to protect wildlife. .  Animals sometime enters villages in search of food when fail to find prey on high altitude during winter months. This also happens in Lahaul-Spiti district where snow leopards come in search of wild goats. To prevent the man-animal conflict, the wildlife department increases patrolling to keep an eye on the animals. .

VHappy Saturday, Psych Central readers!. From the way Facebook profits by exploiting human psychology to how a psychedelic shaman could help cure depression and alcoholism, we\u2019ve got a lot of interesting hot-of-the-press news for you today. Sean Parker Unloads On Facebook \u201cExploiting\u201d Human Psychology: Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, was frank about his feelings toward the social network (including his past role with it) during a speaking event earlier this week: \u201cIt\u2019s a social-validation feedback loop [\u2026] exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you\u2019re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.\u201d. Psychology Group Hits Back at Trump\u2019s Mental Health Comments About Texas Shooting: The American Psychological Association says President Trump\u2019s assertion that the shooting is a \u201cmental health problem\u201d is distracting from the issue of finding solutions to gun violence. How to Prevent \u2018Negativity Bias\u2019 From Affecting Your Relationship: Maybe you\u2019ve heard of negativity bias, but are you familiar with it as it applies to relationships? Basically, it\u2019s a pattern of thinking your partner is always going to respond in a negative way. There are reasons for developing negativity bias, and there are ways to combat it. Why Record Labels Should Pay For Musicians\u2019 Mental Health Care: Musician William Doyle (formerly known as East India Youth) is proposing record labels provide their artists with mental health coverage. Psychedelic Shaman Potion Could Cure Mental Illness: A new study of ayahuasca from University College London and the University of Exeter lends \u201csome support to the notion that ayahuasca could be an important and powerful tool in treating depression and alcohol use disorders,\u201d says lead author Dr. Will Lawn. Having These Personality Traits Might Mean You\u2019re Evil: Dr. Michael H. Stone, author of The Anatomy of Evil and a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University, has traveled the country interviewing mass murderers and serial killers (you might remember him as the host of Discovery Channel\u2019s Most Evil), and he has a few things to say about being born evil, the personality traits of \u201cevil\u201d people, how we might improve our criminal justice system by improving our understanding of what causes evil, and more.

VThe FOSWAC chairman said they would would launch an agitation in a big way. \u201cThe residents cannot pay 50 times more money for the houses they purchased 20 to 30 years ago,\u201d said Bittu. . FOSWAC members during a meeting at DAV School in Sector 15, Chandigarh, on Sunday. (Express). The executive committee meeting of Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC) was held at DAV Model School in Sector 15 on Sunday under the chairmanship of Baljinder Singh Bittu. The committee members criticised the unsettled issue of conversion from lease hold to free hold. They complained that despite repeated requests and protests, the charges of conversion have not been reduced to a reasonable and affordable level. The FOSWAC chairman said they would would launch an agitation in a big way. \u201cThe residents cannot pay 50 times more money for the houses they purchased 20 to 30 years ago,\u201d said Bittu. The committee unanimously passed a resolution to condemn the registration of FIR against Baljinder Singh Bittu and other office bearers of Citizens\u2019 Association which was lodged on the eve of the election for the post of president to Citizens\u2019 Association, Sector 21, in which he was contesting as a president. The members authorised the select committee to make a representation to the Chandigarh DGP to inquire the matter and cancel the FIR registered against Baljinder Singh Bittu. The members observed that crime and especially snatchings in the city is at its peak. \u201cThere is a lukewarm response to the complaints made by the people in normal course. The Police Control Number (100) has become almost inaccessible due to congestion or the reasons not known,\u201d the members observed. The members alleged that the municipal corporation has failed miserably to streamline and implement the Vendor Act owing to political pressure. The markets of sectors 17, 22 and 19 do not have space to accommodate the vendors; therefore these markets should be declared vendor-free zone. Hitesh Puri, vice-chairman of the association, criticised the interference of political parties in the affairs of Residents\u2019 Welfare Association. J S Gogia appraised the association that the NGT has recently held a meeting in Delhi wherein the defaulting states in implementation of environmental pollution and slow garbage processing was discussed. \u201cThe National Green Tribunal came heavily over the defaulters. But pollution has gone three times high in Chandigarh,\u201d he said.

VGovernment has decided to fix the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate at 5 percent for all restaurants and not give them input tax credit. Representative image. The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) today said GST Council's decision to cut tax rate for restaurants to 5 percent without input tax credit will help restaurants across India rationalise tariffs. Welcoming the move by the council, the apex industry body said it had sought bringing down GST rate on restaurants to 12 percent with input tax credit or at 5 percent without input tax credit. "We are extremely thankful to the government for making these much required changes in the GST regime. This will help restaurants across India rationalise tariffs," FHRAI President Garish Oberoi said in a statement. The government today decided to fix the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate at 5 percent for all restaurants and not give them input tax credit. It also decided that restaurants in starred-hotels will charge 18 percent tax with input tax credit, those in lower category hotels to charge 5 percent GST without ITC. Commenting on the development, Deloitte India said in a statement that a uniform tax rate of 12 percent doing away with tax rate distinction between AC and non AC restaurants is welcome, but the critical issue of input tax credit eligibility cannot be ignored. EY India said that the GST rate changes announced today is one more positive step in this direction towards streamlining the rates, reducing complexity and increasing compliance.  "We welcome the reduction in GST slab from a very high 18 percent in an A/C restaurant to 5 percent without any distinction of the air-conditioning. This is certainly historic. However, the very concept of ITC is central to GST, which is to prevent cascading of taxes," NRAI Vice President Rahul Singh said.    .

VPriyank Panchal. (Image credit: AFP Photo). Rajkot: Priyank Panchal led Gujarat's gritty response to Saurashtra's 570, as the opener's 145 guided his team to 304 for four in their Ranji Trophy Group B match.  At stumps on the third and penultimate day, Rujul Bhatt and Chintan Gaja were batting on 75 and 12 respectively, as Gujarat trailed by 266 runs with six first-innings wickets left. .  Resuming on 45 for no loss at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Gujarat lost captain Parthiv Patel (34) in the third over of the day after he was caught by wicketkeeper Snell Patel off left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat. .  Unbeaten on 29 at close of play yesterday, Patel could add only four runs to his overnight score.  Panchal then added 54 runs with Bhargav Merai (22) before the latter was dismissed by left-arm spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja.  Three balls later, Dharmendrasinh struck again to dismiss Manprit Juneja as Gujarat slipped to 109 for three.  Panchal, however, stood firm and put on a 179-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Bhatt, who struck 10 boundaries during his stay in the middle.  During his knock, Panchal found the fence 20 times before being dismissed by Jaydev Unadkat.  Panchal, who had made half centuries in his last two matches, brought up his hundred before tea.  Dharmendrasinh and Unadkat finished with two wickets each. .

VPeter Melhado, President and CEO of ICD Group Limited. President and CEO of the ICD Group Peter Melhado says construction subsidiary West Indies Home Contractors (Wihcon) will be rolling out several projects in two years, for which the cost of development falls in the ballpark of $7 billion. There are 1,748 residential units in the pipeline for construction over the period. Recently, Wihcon sold off some heavy equipment, including cranes, but Melhado said these were surplus assets acquired with the purchase of Kier's holdings. "When we bought Kier's assets in Jamaica, there were a number of pieces of equipment that were surplus to requirements, which we are offering for sale in the normal course of business," Melhado told Gleaner Business. Kier International pulled out of Jamaica two years ago. Wihcon recently moved its headquarters to the old Kier complex at Harbour Head in East Kingston. Melhado himself was once a project engineer with Kier, early in his career. Wihcon, meanwhile, has ended its relationship with ALF Investment Limited, a property management and real estate development company - a partnership out of which two large developments came. The investment company's shareholders are Margaret Mahfood, Sandra Mahfood, Naudia Wright and Ann Brown - each holding one share. In 2011, Wihcon entered into an alliance with ALF, which brought large tracts of land to the partnership. The association resulted in the development of Meadows of Irwin in Montego Bay and a high-end town house complex, Somerset Homes, constructed near Graham Heights in Kingston. The latest development was Jacaranda Homes located at Innswood in St Catherine. Wihcon notes on its website that its partnership with ALF Investments ended in 2017. The new Wihcon projects to be rolled out to the market by December 2019 include The Lofts, located near the National Stadium in Kingston, comprising 128 units; a development in Harbour View, St Catherine, which will field 120 units; and the continuation of phase one of the Friendship development in Irwin, Montego Bay, which is a joint venture with National Housing Trust to construct 1,500 units, Melhado said.

VJumping into the smart home market can be a daunting task. Which light bulbs or speakers are the best? How are they controlled? Will they work with my other smart devices? For many, these questions keep them from taking the plunge, but Lowe's wants to help make things simple. The company has teamed up with software-powered retailer b8ta to open mini-stores inside 70 Lowe's locations nationwide. Smart Home powered by b8ta began as a three-store pilot last year in three California cities -- Aliso Viejo, Burbank, and Livermore. After much success, the store-within-a-store is expanding to help inform more shoppers about smart home devices. Each location will feature top-rated products including security systems, thermostats, cameras, speakers, and more. To encourage hands-on use, products are on display out of the box. Specially trained experts known as "b8ta testers" will be on hand to offer customer support. "Smart home products simplify life \u2013 but the technology can sometimes be confusing or intimidating," said Ruth Crowley, vice president of customer experience design at Lowe's, in a statement. "So, we developed Smart Home powered by b8ta to emulate a 'lab-like' atmosphere that empowers customers to make informed decisions.". Each Smart Home location is easily identifiable by its wood-paneled aisles near the front of the store. Customers can check out more than 60 smart home products from brands such as Google, Sonos, GE, Nest, Iris, Samsung, and Ring. Next to each product is an iPad displaying related information and pricing details. Smartphones are also available so customers can interact with the products and their companion apps. Lowe's has also rolled out specialized smart home displays in 1,000 of its other stores. These displays feature products primed for the upcoming holiday shopping season. For those who prefer to shop online, Lowe's has also enhanced its website so users can enjoy a similar curated smart home experience. Users can gain additional product knowledge, including use cases to inspire people to create a smarter home. With the holidays just around the corner, it's important to know what smart appliances have to offer.

VLamborghini and MIT have teamed up to create a wild and futuristic electric hypercar concept. Called the Lamborghini Terzo Millennio, the concept car is a glimpse into the Italian automaker\u2019s future. Like everything else Lamborghini does, it\u2019s looking for ways to radically change how we perceive automobiles, and in this case, the electrification of them. For the most part, Lamborghini is shying away from committing to electrification, and for now, there\u2019s little reason to believe an all-electric Lamborghini is in the works. But that doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t thinking about an electrified future. Teaming up with MIT, the Terzo Millennio is meant to showcase futuristic technology and this concept is packed with ideas straight out of a sci-fi movie. For example, the automaker is working with MIT professors to develop a way that supercapacitors can both capture and release energy. In addition, the team is conducting research on how to build body components with carbon fiber nanotubes that could serve as lithium-ion batteries. Yes, you read that correctly. Instead of having heavy batteries weighing down an electric car, Lamborghini\u2019s idea is to build them right into the carbon fiber body. To take it to another level, there\u2019s even the idea of making those nanotubes self-healing. Essentially the car is able to self-monitor its carbon fiber structure, with the ability to detect any cracks or damage. When detected, \u201cmicro-channels filled with healing chemistries\u201d will actually work on repairing the structure. Naturally, the technological ideas showcased by the Terzo Millennio aren\u2019t heading to production anytime soon. But don\u2019t be surprised if styling elements of the concept trickle down to future production Lamborghini models. More importantly, however, Lamborghini and MIT are exploring the ideas being presented with the concept, with Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani going so far as to say, \u201cI cannot tell you when \u2026 there are some components that are closer to industrialization than others.\u201d.

VMigratory birds flock to Harike wetland. Amritsar \u2013 The local forest authorities have increased the patrolling at the Harike wetland as the migratory birds from Siberia, Russia, Kazakhstan and other low-temperature regions of the world have started thronging here, an official said. The wetland and the lake were formed by constructing the head works across the Sutlej river in 1953. Since then, the wetland spreading over 100 square miles has become a home to rare varieties of fauna that arrives here from different parts of Europe and northern Asia. . Ferozepur Divisional Forest Officer Charanjit Singh said that as many as 20,000 migratory birds belonging to around 50 species have already arrived at Harike. He said that they had spotted species of birds including Northern Shoveler, Rudi, Shell Duck, Common Shell, Common Koot, Purple Water Head, Black Winged Stilt and Sand Piper this week. He added that they have already increased patrolling at the lake to protect the birds from hunting and that they plan to hire more guards in the next few days. . Singh said that the smog in Punjab is not likely to affect the visit of migratory birds as the birds flew way above that layer of atmosphere and that the count of migratory birds is expected to increase this year due to favourable temperature at the India\u2019s second largest wetland Harike, also known as \u201cHarike Pattan\u2019, the confluence point of Sutlej and Beas rivers. Every year, thousands of winged guests from low-temperature regions arrive at the world-famous bird sanctuary in the first week of November as lakes of those regions freeze in winters. They are expected to stay here till March. . Around 300 species of birds were found in Harike in the last season. Of these, 200 species were migratory and 100 residential. About 1,00,000-125,000 migratory birds visit the lake every winter which makes this time the best to spot the birds.

The results showed that blue lighting accelerates the relaxation process, in comparison with conventional white lighting. (Photo: Pixabay). Feeling stressed? Turn on the blue lights as according to a recent study, they help us relax faster than the white ones. Researchers from the University of Granada (UGR), in collaboration with the School for Special Education San Rafael (Hospitaller Order of Saint John of God, Granada, Spain) proved, by means of an objective evaluation using electrophysiological measurements, that blue lighting accelerates the relaxation process after acute psychosocial stress in comparison with conventional white lighting. The researchers, which belong to the BCI Lab (Brain-Computer Interface Lab) at the University of Granada, noted that psychosocial stress produces some physiological responses that can be measured by means of bio-signals. That stress is very common and negatively affects people's health and quality of life. For their work, the researchers made twelve volunteers to be stressed and then perform a relaxation session within the multisensory stimulation room at the School for Special Education San Rafael. In said room the participants lied down with no stimulus but a blue (group 1) or white (group 2) lighting. Diverse bio-signals, such as heart rate and brain activity, were measured throughout the whole session (by means of an electrocardiogram and an electroencephalogram, respectively). The results showed that blue lighting accelerates the relaxation process, in comparison with conventional white lighting. The results are published in the PLOS One journal.

VNew Delhi, Nov 11, 2017: The Supreme court on Friday asked a PIL petitioner seeking that Hindus be declared as minority community in eight states to approach the National Commission for Minorities. The bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi permitted PIL petitioner and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay withdraw his petition and approach the NCM as he urged the court to declare that Hindus were a minority community in eight states including Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. The petitioner had argued that since Hindus were a small segment of the population at these places, they should receive the benefits that other minority groups enjoyed. Upadhyay has referred to December 18, 1992 resolution of the UN General Assembly and a judgment of the top court to back his plea seeking that Hindus be declared minority in the eight states \u2013 Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab (with 38 per cent of the population), Lakshdweep (2.5 per cent), Mizoram (2.75 per cent), Nagaland (8.75 per cent), Meghalaya (11.5 per cent), Manipur (31 per cent) and Arunachal Pradesh (29 per cent). The petition urged the apex court to quash as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minority Act, issued through a government notification in October 1993, which notifies only Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis as \u201cminority\u201d communities. Jains were added to the list in 2014. TNT news with inputs from Agencies.

VVannya, a mobile app with information about over 1,000 birds, will be launched here on Sunday (November 12). The app, developed by Shashank Dalvi an alumni of WCS-NCBS and his team comprising wildlife enthusiasts, biologists and engineers.  Talking to Covai Post, Shashank said the app will be dedicated to noted ornithologist Salim Ali on his 121st birth anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s a very user friendly and helpful app for beginners to identify the varieties of birds in India. The first version contains more than 4,000 photographs of various bird species of different plumages clicked by renowned wildlife photographers,\u201d he said. The app also contains information about birds based on the field observations. \u201cBird watchers can add their own notes in this app and they can also mark the bird species which they have spotted. Very soon, it will be compiled with multiple pages and songs related to birds will be included for the better identification,\u201d Shashank added. \u201cIt took one year to furnish the data in this application by our team. This application will act as a platform that will educate the society about India\u2019s rich natural heritage, help networking of bird watchers, scientists and conservationists.\u201d. Shashank Dalvi has worked in the North-East, Western Ghats and Andaman and Nicobar islands. He was also part of a team that found a new species of bird called Himalayan Forest Thrush (Zoothera salimalii) in 2016. \u201cIt has been named after Salim Ali, who spotted 1,128 birds in a single year.\u201d. The app will be launched by Bittu Sahgal, Founder and Editor of Sanctuary Asia magazine. It will be available in both Google Play Store and Apple i Store for android and iPhones from today after 5 p.m. The info graphics for this app was designed by Nakshi and logo by Deborshee Gogoi.

V Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday continued his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation and said during the note ban all the hoarders turned their black money into white. Addressing a rally in Banaskantha of poll-bound Gujarat, Rahul said, "During Modi ji's note ban all the hoarders in India converted all their black money into white.". Earlier in the day, the Congress scion had cornered Modi for favouring few top businessmen and ignoring the small traders. Rahul, who is on the second day of the Navsarjan Yatra, began his election campaign from Banaskantha. He will address a series of public meetings covering Danta, Palanpur, Mota, Deesa, Wadinath Temple, Thara, Totana, Roda, Kansada Darwaja and Patan. Meanwhile, taking to Twitter, Rahul also demanded to scrap GST on essential commodities, bringing petrol, diesel, gas cylinders under the GST ambit and fix a uniform rate, not more than 18 per cent. The political parties have been campaigning vigorously and not leaving a single opportunity to attack each other verbally in the light of the forthcoming assembly elections in Gujarat.(ANI).

VA ceremonial welcome for wheat in Zaranj. Photo courtesy: Twitter. New Delhi, November 11. In a significant sign of trilateral cooperation, the first consignment of wheat from India to Afghanistan, that was flagged off by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Afghan counterpart Salahuddin Rabbani on October 29, reached the Afghan city of Zaranj near the Iran-Afghanistan border on Saturday via the Iranian port of Chabahar, thereby bypassing Pakistan. Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Manpreet Vohra said pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani decorated Zaranj as the shipment arrived. The shipment to Afghanistan comes in the wake of Ghani\u2019s one-day visit to India on October 24. India is a major development aid partner for strife-torn Afghanistan. The shipment is part of a commitment made by India to supply 1.1 million tonnes of wheat for the people of Afghanistan on a grant basis. This is the first shipment to reach Afghanistan via Chabahar after trilateral agreement to develop the port as a transport and transit corridor between India, Iran and Afghanistan was signed by PM Modi with Iranian and Afghan Presidents Hassan Rouhani and Ashraf Ghani in May last year. \u2014 IANS.

VSo let's say that you are using Bluetooth on your Android Oreo powered handset so that you can play music over your car's audio system. As soon as you connect to the car's speaker, your phone appears to be connecting to a phantom incoming phone call. There is nothing on the dialer suggesting that a call was received. Since the car's audio system thinks that it has to turn over control of the speaker to a phone call, albeit one that doesn't exist, the music you wanted to listen to is replaced by silence. Last month, a thread was started on the Google Issue Tracker site and as it turns out, a possible culprit was discovered. It seems that if you remove Skype Lite for Android, this bug goes away. Therefore, you don't have to be a genius app developer to figure out that uninstalling Skype Lite from your handset is an easy workaround for this problem. You can replace Skype Lite with regular Skype, and it won't hijack your streaming audio. However, there is no guarantee that this is the only app that is causing the problem, since some of those complaining about the issue never had Skype Lite on their device. For now though, if the phantom calls have been an issue, preventing you from streaming over Bluetooth, check to see if you do have the app installed. And if you do find Skype Lite on your phone, you know what to do. Skype Lite offers most of the same main features that Skype does, but will work on older internet networks, including those running 2G. Data and files are compressed, including conversations, photos and videos. source: GoogleIssueTracker via AndroidPolice.

VThis is the lowest level since August 2009, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 1,10,355 crore.   New Delhi, Nov 12:  .  Investments in the Indian capital market through participatory notes (P-notes) plunged to an over eight-year low of Rs 1.23 lakh crore at September-end in view of stringent norms put in place by regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). .  The total value of P-notes investments in Indian markets - equity, debt and derivatives - slumped to Rs 1,22,684 crore at September-end after hitting seven-and-a-half year low of Rs 1,25,037 crore at the end of August, according to SEBI data. .  This is the lowest level since August 2009, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 1,10,355 crore. .  P-notes are issued by registered foreign portfolio investors to overseas players who wish to be part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly. They, however, need to go through due diligence. .  Of the total investments in September, P-note holdings in equities were at Rs 91,160 crore and the remaining in debt and derivatives markets. .  Besides, the quantum of FPI investments via P-notes remains unchanged at 4.1 per cent. .  Over the past few months, the SEBI has taken several measures to stop the misuse of the controversy-ridden participatory notes. .  In July, the markets regulator notified stricter P-notes norms stipulating a fee of USD 1,000 that would be levied on each instrument to check any misuse for channelising black money. Also, SEBI prohibited FPIs from issuing such notes where the underlying asset is a derivative, except those which are used for hedging purposes. .  The move was a follow-through of SEBI\u2019s board approval of a relevant proposal in June. These measures were an outcome of a slew of other steps taken by the regulator in the recent past. .  In April, SEBI had barred resident Indians, NRIs and entities owned by them from making investment through P-notes. .  he decision was part of efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework for P-notes, which have been long seen as being possibly misused for routing black money from abroad. .

VChambor is one brand that has always focused on quality. I have tried a lot of products from this brand and loved most of them specially Chambor Orosa Skin Fusion Foundation and sculpting eye shadow. Brand has recently revamped their much loved Chambor Rouge Plump lipsticks in a new silver packaging. I have few of the shades with me that I have been trying out these for little over 2 weeks now and thought of sharing my views \u2013. Plumps up lips ! Reduce Fine lines !The all New Rouge Plum ++ is infused with a \u2018BROSH Bio Lip Complex\u2019. This complex increases volume of lips and smoothens fine lines for firmer and younger looking lips while providing deep moisturization. It helps to stimulate production of collagen. Protects lips from the damage of UV rays. Packaging of new Chambor Rouge Plump Lipstick is interesting with 25 shades. The silver sleek case looks luxurious, the body is textured and light weight. However it is light weight not in a good way, feels quite fragile and low quality as the material is not metal but plastic. You get 2.5g product. Shades \u2013 I have 5 of these but one is a clear lip balm (700) so I am excluding it from the review. Rest 4 are \u2013. 706 \u2013 Burgundy Red. 751 \u2013 Rosy Pink (a perfect everyday color). 757 \u2013 Plum. 758 \u2013 Marsala. I love all the 4 shades as they are quite beautiful shades. 751 can be a perfect rosy nude for my skin tone, 757 is also a great shade not too dark. Rest two are quite dark but beautiful nonetheless. Texture & Formula \u2013 Chambor Rouge Plump Lipsticks have beautiful creamy texture that glides on smoothly without tugging or pulling. I love how comfortable and moisturising they feel on the lips. The formula does blur fine lines on the lips and gives an illusion of fuller lips. The texture is almost a cross between gel & cream, it feels extremely light weight. There is a slight minty sensation when you apply the lipstick. It has a fruity scent, very mild though. Formula is quite apt for upcoming season when lips tend to get really dry & flaky. With Chambor Rouge Plump Lipstick I can totally skip applying a lip balm underneath. Pigmentation \u2013 As you can see in the above swatches the shades are quite pigmented. Those are only one swipe of color with no layering. Chambor Rouge Plump Lipsticks offer opaque finish in single stroke. Staying Power \u2013 I get a wear time of good 4-6 hours with these. Since the formula is quite creamy, the lipstick fades after meals. Chambor Rouge Plump Lipsticks are priced at Rs 945, available online at Shopperstop HERE. *PR Samples.

VPatna, November 10: Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha said on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should fire Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over Goods and Services Tax (GST) "mess" which he said was implemented by the minister "without applying his mind.". "This man (Jaitley) has created all the mess while bringing in GST, thereby inflicting one blow after another to the traders throughout the country," said Yashwant. The former Union finance minister who served under Vajpayee regime was in the state capital to attend a symposium on 'Vanchit varg' (deprived section) organised by former Assembly Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary at AN Sinha Institute. Speaking shortly after the GST Council decided to keep only 50 items in the top 28% bracket, Yashwant said, "Instead of tinkering with the GST, it will be better if the Centre sets up a committee under noted economist Vijay Kelkar to look into the various aspects of GST. But before that, I would urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack Arun Jaitley who has miserably failed as Finance Minister.". Later, talking to media, Yashwant said his son Jayant Sinha (Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation), whose name recently figured in the Paradise Papers, should be investigated "as long as Amit Shah's son Jay Shah is also investigated for allegations of benefiting from crony capitalism.". Jayant, a former venture capitalist, was named in the Paradise Papers for being one of the wealthy politicians having offshore investments. "I would appeal to the government to probe all those people mentioned in the Paradise Papers list. Complete the investigation within a stipulated time-frame, say 15 days or a month. But also conduct an independent assessment of Amit Shah's son," said the former minister. (Courtesy: DH).

VA house which developed cracks due to a low-frequency earthquake as claimed by villagers at Hasanabad village of Humnabad taluk. (Express photo Service). BIDAR: The villagers of Hasanabad in Humnabad taluk of Bidar district spent a sleepless night on Saturday owing to what they claimed were low-frequency earthquakes between 1 am and 6 am.  Villagers said that they experienced these earthquakes at least four times in the wee hours of Saturday. As the panic spread, everybody trooped out of their houses and spent the night out in the cold, lighting up a few fires to stay warm. Some houses in the village were even damaged and have developed cracks, they said.  Humnabad tahsildar Devendrappa Pani and executive officer of the taluk panchayat Dr Govind Hasnabad heard the woes of the people and were told that these earthquakes were being experienced for the past one week. The earth was vibrating and sounds could be heard from the ground, they told the officers. The damage to the houses is minor in nature. Officials speaking with the villagers of Hasanabad to take first-hand information on the claimed earthquake in Hasanabad in the wee hours of Saturday. (Express Photo Service). On contacting the Department of Mines and Geology, Pani was told that there were no earthquakes recorded on the Richter scale monitor. However, the monitor would not be able to detect minor earthquakes, he was told. Such minor disturbances and vibrations were common in villages where the limestone content is high in the earth and water levels are also significant as the chemical reaction would result in such vibrations, the tahsildar was told. There would be no danger from such phenomena, Pani was told.

VFacebook\u2019s standalone Events app has received a significant update, which comes with a full rebranding and more opportunities to discover local highlights. No longer being focused exclusively on events, the app has been renamed \u201cLocal.\u201d In addition to being able to find local events, the new app allows for the discovery of restaurants, bars, and other local businesses. You can search for events and places nearby, whether you\u2019re in your hometown or visiting another city. It\u2019s the new destination for planning a night out with friends. That could spell bad news for competing services like Yelp, TripAdvisor, Bandsintown, and others. This is especially a concern when you consider the amount of business pages and event listings Facebook already has access to. Facebook\u2019s Local app also has the competitive advantage of being integrated with the world\u2019s largest social network. That means you can see what friends are doing, as well as share your plans with others. You can receive recommendations from friends, see what\u2019s trending near you, or follow one of Facebook\u2019s curated guides. With the ability to schedule plans on a built-in calendar, so you don\u2019t even need to check your calendar app to see what\u2019s going on in your social life. What Does This Mean for Marketers?. Let\u2019s face it, not everything Facebook develops is a smash hit. However, if the Local app ends up becoming wildly popular, marketers will have to step up their Facebook game. If you\u2019re marketing a local business, keep its Facebook page regularly updated. Take every opportunity you can to create an event page. Having a sale? Create an event page. Launching a new product? Create an event page. Hosting an event? Well, it goes without saying that should have an event page. More event pages means more opportunities to get discovered in the Local app. When you\u2019re discovered by someone who wasn\u2019t previously following your page, it helps to see some recent activity. The new Facebook Local app can be downloaded from the iOS and Android app stores, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be available outside of the US.

While an important question to ask is what he can do for diplomacy, it is just as important to ask what diplomacy can do for Melania Trump's wardrobe. The American First Lady started the tour bundled up in a thick coat in Tokyo, but had made a less conservative fashion choice by the time she got to their second stop, Seoul, choosing to wear a sheer dress to a state dinner. It remains to be seen what the 47-year-old will sport during her next few days in China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Cosy florals. Photo: AFP. Arriving in Japan, she stepped off the plane in a striped wool Fendi coat embellished with flowers. She paired it with nude Manolo Blahnik heels.

VTSEWANG RIGZIN.  LEH: In a controversial case of land encroachment that has different interesting twists and turns, the district administration on Friday evening dismantled private structures built by a group of people on a land measuring about ten Kanals at Agling near the RTO Office.  The land was reportedly proposed by the Revenue Department in favour of the Forest Department about 22 years ago and accordingly the Forest Department claims to have built the compound wall of the land about two decades ago. However, the Forest Department neither used the land all this while nor developed it properly. As the Forest Department learnt that private structures were coming up inside the compound wall of the land, it informed the district administration and the Revenue Department. With the help of the police, administration finally succeeded dismantling all structures created on the land and on Saturday morning Forest Department erected a sign board and the Deputy Commissioner Avny Lavasa also visited the disputed site.  Officials of the Forest Department claim that land has been grabbed by some people in spite of the fact that department had Khasara number. However, it is learnt that those carrying out private construction on the land also had Khasara number issued by the Revenue Department which makes the case more complicated.  According to sources, Khasara number in favour of the group of individual was issued by Revenue Department on the direction of the previous Chief Executive Councillor of LAHDC Leh on the receipt of the report from the Revenue Department about the status of the land, apparently not knowing that the Forest Department already had a claim and it had built the wall.  When asked how the Revenue Department can issue double Khasara numbers to two different groups, DC Leh said if there is a double Khasara, one will be cancelled after hearing the parties and the Divisional Forest Officer Leh has been asked to give it in writing. She appealed to the people to bring such cases to the notice of the administration if there is any.  \u201cIt was in our possession for more than 20 years as it was allotted to the Forest department for firewood depot,\u201d Divisional Forest Officer Mohammad Abass said adding that the Department is now planning to make it a mini nursery of ever green plants brought from outside Ladakh. He said earlier the department had a plan to construct a division office building on the land and a proposal in this regard was submitted to the government but it was not sanctioned.

V There's a reason why some bosses are abusive. . Need a quick mental boost? Be a jerk. At least, that\u2019s what one group of researchers has discovered. According to a recent study published in the Academy of Management Journal, when bosses bully or belittle their employees, they experience short-lived benefits such as improved well-being and replenished energy. While research has repeatedly revealed the repercussions of abusive supervision, some bosses continue to act like jerks. So, there must be some benefits from abusive actions. To understand what these benefits are, researchers studied and collected data from employees and managers in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, education and service, in both China and the U.S. Turns out, managers who bullied and took out their frustrations on workers experienced a \u201csense of recovery\u201d because their abusive actions replenished their mental energy and resources. When managers -- or people, in general -- hold in their feelings and suppress certain behaviors, it takes a lot of mental energy, which leads to \u201cmental fatigue,\u201d says Russell Johnson, an associate professor at Michigan State University who co-authored the study, in a summary of the findings. To the contrary, when bosses act on impulse, bullying and belittling employees, they save the mental energy they would have otherwise used to suppress their aggravation. However, don\u2019t let this fool you: This mental recovery period won\u2019t last long. According to the study, the benefits last for a week -- or less -- and that kind of behavior can have some serious side effects in the long-run. \u201cAlthough abuse may be helpful and even mentally restorative for supervisors in the short-term, over the long haul it will come back to haunt them,\u201d Johnson says. Abusive behavior can put a company and its culture at risk, potentially resulting in decreased trust, support and productivity from employees. It may even lead employees to quit. Rather than taking your frustrations out on your employees, the researchers suggest that supervisors minimize their workloads and take breaks regularly to cool down. They also advise communicating more with employees as a healthy, social outlet for negative emotions.

He bought a whopping 25 iPhone X approximately totaling to a mind blowing $31,000 (Approx Rs 22 \u2013 Rs 25.5 Lakhs), to impress his girlfriend and request for her partnership for life. He placed the iPhones on the ground in the form of a heart shape to form a super-expensive enclosure with an engagement ring in the centre of it. While many were awed with his gesture, others were surprised as to why the iPhone X in particular. Well, the gamer says that he and his fiancé are both avid gamers and big fans of smartphone gaming, which is why he went ahead to opt for the most expensive and best performing gaming mobile device out there.

VIn yet another overhaul within a week, Twitter has doubled the length of users\u2019 display names to 50 characters \u2014 up from the original 20. \u201cThe new length means the user can add more emojis. Many users embraced the change, though some also questioned why Twitter was adding somewhat gimmicky features when it could be working on tackling its more serious issues on the platform,\u201d The Verge reported late on Friday. To change your display name, the user can head over to their Twitter profile, click on \u201cEdit Profile\u201d on the right side of the page, and then click on the current display name. Notably, users can make the changes only on the display name, not the \u201c@user\u201d name. Meanwhile, the micro blogging platform is currently facing backlash in the wake of harassment problems. Earlier this week, Twitter introduced a new 280-character limit that is now available virtually for all users \u2014 including for those who tweet in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi and Tamil. In September, the company had launched a test with a select group of users that expanded the 140-character limit so that they could express themselves easily in a tweet.

VTennis: Federer opens ATP Finals bid with victory over Sock. Tennis - ATP World Tour Finals - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - November 12, 2017 USA's Jack Sock reacts during his group stage match against Switzerland's Roger Federer Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien. By Martyn Herman. LONDON (Reuters) - Aiming to end a sensational year as he began it, Swiss master Roger Federer opened his bid for a seventh ATP Finals title with 6-4 7-6(4) victory over American debutant Jack Sock on Sunday. The 36-year-old was given a thorough workout by Sock although had he been a little more clinical the scoreline would have been more heavily-weighted in his favour. Sock, who gate-crashed the end-of-season party when he burst from the pack to qualify by winning the Paris Masters, made the worst possible start when the second of two superb backhand winners gave Federer a break in the first game. It was the only break of serve in the match, although Federer was always a step ahead of his 25-year-old opponent, who possesses one of the hardest forehands in the game. Federer, the oldest player to qualify for the ATP Finals since 1970, looked aghast as two break points went begging at 3-3 and another two at 4-4 in the second set. More stoic resistance by Sock saw him fend off more danger at 5-5 but Federer remained untouchable on serve and won 29 of 32 points on his delivery in the second set. Federer jumped into a 4-2 lead in the tiebreak and although Sock finally took a point off the six-time champion's serve to level at 4-4, Federer reeled off the next three points to claim victory. "It's always a struggle in the first match of any tournament," Federer, who took his grand slam title haul to 19 by winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year after missing the last six months of 2016 through injury, said. "I got off to a great start, my big hope was I was going to be able to play a bit more freely after that. "The second set was tight, I missed some opportunities, the breaker could have gone either way and in the end he helped me with some double faults and some mistakes.". Shortly afterwards Rafael Nadal was presented with the award for the year-end number one ranking -- with the Spaniard scheduled to open his campaign for the only big prize to elude him on Monday against Belgium's David Goffin. .

VIndian skipper Virat Kohli.  New Delhi: . Several men choose to go without shaving in November every year to spread awareness on prostate cancer, testicular cancer and men's suicide. Invest in good beard oils and don't forget to moisturise your face, say experts. Here are a few looks and ways to maintain men's facial hair:. * Flaunt the old and classic goatee in new avatars. Men with rectangular or even square shaped faces look best with them. . * A beard is supposedly a natural shield. Using a good moisturiser protects your face from the cold, dry air. Moisturisers also keep the skin hydrated and prevent dead skin cells from gathering and clogging up the follicles. * Try the chin-strap beard look and don it with a tuxedo or just your formal office wear. This look is all about suave and sophistication. Keep shaving the rest of your beard-area while you keep trimming the beard around your chin. * Massage your face with a beard oil in small circular motions for about 10 minutes, atleast two times a day. Facial massage improves blood circulation thereby stimulating new hair growth. Amla oil is a natural remedy to enhance facial hair growth. Rinse your face with cold water. You could also use Mafura Oil. It is rich in essential fatty acids, protects dry skin, and improves elasticity. It also has antimicrobial properties and does not clog pores or leave the skin or beard greasy. * Bandholz is another look best suited for men with oval-shaped or triangular ones. Opt for this only if you have the patience to grow this thickness and the care to groom the process of growing the beard. Try out your minerals and vitamins along with the beard care nourishing oil. * Prevent the growth of ingrown hair. A beard does not grow evenly if there is ingrown hair on the face. Reduce the chances of getting ingrown hairs by using safe, gentle hair-removal techniques. * If you have a square or circular face, go for Mutton Chops. Let your sideburns and moustache grow until they meet. Shave the hair on your chin until the lower lip area. . * Keep it clean. Wash the face with warm water and use mild cleanser every morning and evening. Cleansing your beard regularly using an aloe vera based mild solution is helpful to keep off the dirt. Aloe vera softens the hair follicle and keeps it strong. . In case of itchy rash, use an anti-dandruff shampoo two to three times weekly to prevent infection or apply hydrocortisone cream.

VMahindra\u2019s tenure in the Moto3 World Championship came to a conclusion in Valencia, with two of its rider finishing inside the top 20. Mahindra entered the junior class of MotoGP in 2011, when it still ran on 125cc bikes. The Indian manufacturer steadily progressed through the field over the years, scoring three wins in a breakthrough 2016 season. In Valencia, Kornfeil led the charge for Mahindra on a Peugeot-branded MGP30, finishing 18th. The Czech rider sprinted from 25th to 20th on the opening lap and then gained two more places in the remainder of the 31-lap encounter. Meanwhile, factory-supported Aspar team\u2019s Lorenzo Dalla Porta finished just over a second behind in 20th, down one spot from his starting position. CIP\u2019s Manuel Pagliani was next up in 22nd place and a fraction of a second ahead of Dalla Porta\u2019s teammate Albert Arenas. Marco Bezzecchi, who scored Mahindra\u2019s only podium of 2017 at Motegi, ended up a distant 28th after falling off the bike early in the race. Although Mahindra failed to score points in the final round, it did accumulate 69 points during the previous 18 races of the season. \u201cObviously, this was quite an emotional day \u2013 our last time, at least for the moment, after seven years and some very proud moments,\u201d Mahindra Moto3 chief Mufaddal Choonia said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to add to our points score today, but at the same time our riders showed the strength of our package, keeping up in a close fight. As always, better qualifying positions would have meant better finishes. \u201cMahindra has had some real highs over the last seven seasons, most especially our three wins last year. We can be proud also of our riders, past and present. \u201cGrand Prix racing has been a pleasure and a privilege for all of us.\u201d.

VMixed reality experiences that blend rendered graphics with real-world environments are the endgame of computing, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said earlier this week. While speaking with former cricket player Anil Kumble during his two-day visit to India that ended Tuesday, the 50-year-old singled out mixed reality, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence as the three main technologies that he believes will shape the world going forward, both in terms of the near and distant future. His remarks reinforce what Microsoft already implied when it announced HoloLens several years back \u2013 it sees mixed reality experiences as the interfaces of the future. While Minority Report-like holograms may not be functional in the immediate term, a combination of augmented and virtual reality enabled by high-tech headsets is something that Microsoft appears to be adamant to pursue. Every sector from healthcare and education to administration and entertainment can and already does benefit from HoloLens-powered solutions, Mr. Nadella recalled, adding that there\u2019s much more of such solutions to come as Microsoft refines its mixed reality offerings. Microsoft CEO didn\u2019t go into many details regarding the tech giant\u2019s AI and quantum computing-related endeavors, having only indicated that both are part of the company\u2019s long-term vision. Mr. Nadella\u2019s recent visit to his home country was part of his ongoing tour promoting his new book \u201cHit Refresh\u201d which tells the story of how he reorganized Microsoft after taking over the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant from Steve Ballmer in 2014. Unlike his predecessor, the Indian-born business executive appears to be on good terms with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates who famously fell out with Mr. Ballmer over the years, with the two supposedly not even speaking to each other following the previous CEO\u2019s decision to retire. Mr. Gates penned the foreword of Hit Refresh, praising the firm\u2019s current chief for immediately leaving his mark on Microsoft after taking over the company. With Microsoft\u2019s recent decision to completely drop any commitments to Windows Phone and its intensifying cloud-related efforts, as well as the aforementioned remarks from its CEO, it appears that the firm has a well-defined vision of the future that it\u2019s now seeking to aggressively pursue under Mr. Nadella\u2019s leadership.

V Aurangabad: Seventeen cows and a bull were found dead at Indewadi on the outskirts of Jalna city on Saturday morning, sparking off tension in the area. .  Preliminary investigation by a government veterinary found that the animals, belonging to a temple in the village, died of poisoning. There is no shelter for the animals. .  The village sarpanch suspects that the cows may have died after eating crops sprayed with pesticides or poisoned as the farmers have been complaining about crop damage by the animals .  Based on a complaint lodged by the village's Mahatma Gandhi Tanta Mukti Yojana (peace committee) president Sarjerao Shinde, the Taluka police station in Jalna have registered an offence against unidentified people under section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle)of IPC. .  Jalna sub-divisional police officer Sachin Bari said an autopsy was performed on the carcasses of all the animals and the viscera has been preserved for carrying out chemical analysis. .  A villager who went to answer nature's call in a farm saw a cow carcass and immediately alerted the fellow villagers. The villagers, along with the village sarpanch, searched all the farms in and around Indewadi and found 17 more carcasses besides two critically ill cows, Jalna police said. .  Soon, a message was passed on to the authorities, who, along with the police officials, rushed to the spot and carried out a spot 'panchanama'. .  Private as well as government appointed vets were roped who surprisingly found the remaining 20 cows in good health, police said. .  Village sarpanch Shivnath Kale told TOI that the farmers from the Indewadi and surrounding villages were unhappy with the cows as they were damaging the crops in their farms. .  "The farmers have been complaining against the crop destruction by cows for almost a decade but not action has been taken so far. We fear that these cows either ate the jowar crop that has been sprayed with a concentrated pesticide or some disgruntled farmers may have poisoned them," he said. .  The cows belonged to a Maruti temple in Indewadi and were donated by devotees who frequented the temple. Villagers said that these cows live in the open and feed on grass and even crops in the farms nearby sometimes. .

V Keeping the God-given gift in tip top shape! . #10 Don't Towel Dry .  Because of the friction caused by the towel, your hair will become frizzy leading to more hair damage. Instead, use a t-shirt or blot your hair. . #9 More isn't good .  Don't use too much of shampoo or conditioner thinking that the more you use, the quicker you can get the result you need. . #8 Be Gentle .  Don't scrub your hair very hard as it leads to more hair problems and hair loss. Mild and gentle movement is the way to go. #7 Start from roots, end at tips .  We don't always wash our hair the way we have to. But you must not break this rule- start at the roots and work your way through the tips. The root is the majority of the area where you need to focus on as more problems are dealt there. Moisturize your tips and only your tips. . #6 Shampoo isn't always good .  Due to the numerous advertisements, you might be under the impression that shampoo is a must for washing your hair. But you're wrong. Too much of shampoo in the long run just damages your hair. Because ultimately shampoo is made of chemicals. Water is the best thing for your hair.Skip the constant shampooing and use just water for healthier hair. . #5 Say no to repeating! .  The rinse and repeat technique isn't a good choice as the second round strips your hair of its moisture. Only do this when in need. . #4 No Hot Water! .  At the end of a busy day,a hot steamy shower might sound like just the thing you need. But your hair definitely doesn't need it as hot water damages the hair a great deal. Switch from hot to lukewarm water. . #3 Conditioning Timely! .  Most people when they use conditioner don't let it settle and just wash it all way. Don't do that! Time yourself, detangle your hair while waiting and voila! Amazing smoothness! . #2 Don't condition wet hair! .  Because the conditioner doesn't work the way it should when your hair is dripping wet. . #1 Be Calm .  At the end of it all, turn off the water, take a few seconds to yourself and finish it up with a quick wash with just cold water. .

At one point in the video, she recalls that when she asked a salesperson where the full-length mirrors were, the employee replied, "There are no mirrors over here because we don't try on furnishings.". Not anymore, HomeGoods. Not anymore. . The video \u2014 a full 24 minutes of America's Next Top Model-level posing \u2014 is worth a watch. She solicits other shoppers to get their opinions, explains how it just needs a "little tightening and a button," and notes that a tree doesn't "need to be this damn warm, y'all, it's already in the house." But if you want to just get to the good stuff, skip right to the 2:15 mark to see the tree skirt cape reveal. And if you're looking for a chic way to top your holiday look, get yourself to HomeGoods now (and look for the $49 34th & Pine faux-fur line!). As Bae says, "it's a tree skirt, but who has to know?".

VCHENNAI: Domestic passenger vehicle sales dropped marginally in October, the first decline in four months, as dealers held back on adding to their inventory as festive sales in the August- September period were not as robust as expected. Light commercial vehicles (LCV) and three-wheelers, however, reported double-digit growth. Within the passenger vehicles segment, car sales plunged 5.32 per cent to 1,84,666 units last month against 1,95,036 units in October last year, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data showed. The decline was also reflected in the overall vehicle sales across categories, which stood at 21,62,164 units against 22,01,489 units in October 2016, down 1.79 per cent. \u201cThe festive season could have been a lot better but this is not necessarily a reflection of market sentiment. It is a temporary blip...The decline in sales is more to do with inventory correction by the manufacturers,\u201d said Siam director-general Vishnu Mathur. From July to September, there was inventory build-up by manufacturers at dealerships ahead of the festival purchases and in October they have reduced dispatches, he added. Barring the likes of Maruti and Tata Motors, other automakers posted either flat or decline in sales largely on the back of tepid festive sales. Maruti Suzuki India clocked a growth of 9.25 per cent at 1,35,413 units. Hyundai Motor India sales, too, was down 0.86 per cent at 49,588 units. Other players like Mahindra & Mahindra also posted a decline of 5.35 per cent at 23,413 units, although homegrown rival Tata Motors saw a growth of 3.22 per cent at 18,314 units in October this year. Utility vehicle sales, however, registered double-digit increase of 12.44 per cent to 79,323 units. While sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles expanded close to one per cent, dispatch of LCV grew at 10 per cent to 43,635 units. Total commercial vehicles and three-wheelers volume rose 6.44 per cent to 69,793 units and 1.3 per cent, respectively, in October, Siam said. On the two-wheeler front, sales declined by almost three per cent to 1.75 million units in October. This is the first decline in the segment since February.

V(adds background, detail). By Raya Jalabi and Ahmed Rasheed. BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A strong earthquake hit large parts of northern Iraq and the capital Baghdad on Sunday, and also caused damage in villages across the border in Iran where state TV said at least six people had been killed. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Iraq after the quake, whose epicentre was in Penjwin, in Sulaimaniyah province which is in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region very close to the Iranian border, according to an Iraqi meteorology official. But eight villages were damaged in Iran and at least six people were killed and many others injured in the border town of Qasr-e Shirin in Iran, Iranian state TV said. The US Geological Survey said the quake measured a magnitude of 7.3, while an Iraqi meteorology official put its magnitude at 6.5 according to preliminary information. Many residents in the Iraqi capital Baghdad rushed out of houses and tall buildings in panic. "I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air," said Majida Ameer, who ran out of her building in the capital's Salihiya district with her three children. "I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming 'Earthquake!'". There were similar scenes in Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region, and across other cities in northern Iraq, close to the quake's epicentre. Iraq's meteorology center advised people to stay away from buildings and not to use elevators, in case of aftershocks. The quake was even felt in the Iranian capital Tehran, with some villages hit by power cuts, Iranian state TV reported. "The quake was felt in several Iranian provinces bordering Iraq ... Eight villages were damaged ... Electricity has been cut in some villages and rescue teams have been dispatched to those areas," TV reported. Residents of Turkey's southeastern city of Diyarbakir also reported feeling a strong tremor, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in the city. Israeli media said the quake was felt in many parts of Israel too. (Reporting by Raya Jalabi and Ahmed Rasheed in Iraq,; Parisa Hafezi in Ankara; Editing by Susan Fenton and Richard Balmforth).

VNAINITAL One of the most sought-after destinations for tourists visiting Uttarakhand, Nainital has remained an abode of eternal charm. But very few are aware of the Lok Sanskriti Sangrahalaya, a private museum in Bhimtal that houses several rare art objects. Its owner, now in his late seventies, continues to strive day and night on its upkeep.  \u201cArt is something which, if not preserved, will become extinct. It represents our culture and is our identity. If not protected, then nothing will be left to show the later generations. So, I wanted to build a place where I can collect and display the art and let people know about our roots,\u201d said Padma Shri awardee Yashodhar Mathpal, who built this museum to preserve local culture, document oral and written traditions and folklore, provide training to the vanishing arts and crafts of the region, and encourage local artisans.    With a team of just three, Mathpal said it is often a difficult task to take care of the museum. His effort to keep the dying art of the Kumaon and Garhwal belt alive has been largely ignored by the government. \u201cI got a call from a museum in France to showcase my collection, but never got a chance to be a part of any art exhibition in Nainital. Art is yet not appreciated in India as it is done in other countries,\u201d he lamented. Founded in 1983, the Lok Sanskriti Sangrahalaya is home to more than 500 paintings, including cave paintings, a 14-foot-long water colour, old manuscripts and much more.  .

V\u201cBaby Time\u201d for the 68-year-old Singer?. Hot news. French tabloids recently reported Laurent Voulzy\u2019s companion was pregnant after she sported what some interpreted to be a \u2018baby bump\u2019. According to the report, a source close to the couple confirmed they were expecting a child. UPDATE 11/11/2017 : This story seems to be false. (read more). Is Laurent Voulzy about to be a dad to a little boy or girl?. Speculation is rampant that the singer best known for his hit song Rockollection is expecting a baby with long-time partner after she was spotted with a prominent stomach bulge on Thursday evening (November 9, 2017), during romantic dinner date nearby his place. Another source revealed that \u201cshe TWICE made toasts ... by drinking water instead of wine,\u201d adding that it is \u201chighly unusual\u201d to \u201ctoast with anything but a full glass of wine.\u201d (In case you weren\u2019t aware, pregnant ladies aren\u2019t supposed to drink alcohol.). Twitter reacts to Laurent Voulzy pregnancy rumor. The singer\u2019s rep told journalist, \u201cI do not comment on his personal life,\u201d... and therefore has neither confirmed nor denied. This has caused multiple stories about the alleged pregnancy to make their way through bulletin boards and other social media sites during the past 24 hours, just following engagement rumors earlier this week. Now we\u2019ll have to wait and see if that \u2018baby bump\u2019 and that \u2018high-profile wine-voidance\u2019 are the key clues that ultimately lead to the Best Famous Baby News of the year. © 2017 MediaMass All rights reserved.

V(Representational Image). International scientific collaboration in the Arctic can help align common interests among countries experiencing geopolitical conflict, including the US and Russia, researchers say. The assessment builds upon the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation that was signed in May this year by the foreign ministers of the eight Arctic States, including the US and Russia, despite deteriorating relations between the two countries, according to researchers at Tufts University in the US. The agreement, also known as the Arctic Science Agreement, minimises the risks that short-term domestic policy shifts will impact relations within the Arctic by cementing a consensus among the countries that will last beyond political cycles, said Paul Arthur Berkman, professor at Tufts. He noted that the agreement enhances the stability of research platforms across nations to interpret and disseminate previously inaccessible data, and will generate continuous data to interpret marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, and human-centred changes. In effect, the Arctic Science Agreement enhances the capacity of all nations to integrate diverse data into evidence and options that contribute to informed decision- making for Arctic sustainability, he said. "Governments respond to security issues that involve the risks of political, economic, and cultural instabilities," said Berkman, lead author of the study published in the journal Science. . "In a global context, unlike any time in human history, there also is urgency to address issues, impacts, and resources involving present and future generations, recognising that children born today will be living in the 22nd century," he said. . The researchers examined the history of international Arctic collaboration that began in the 1950s and has grown ever since, illustrating how science diplomacy has already promoted cooperation and prevented conflict in the Arctic, most notably between the US and Russia.

VA collapsed building in northeast Iraq, near the city of Sulamaniyah. At least 10 have been killed, six in Iran and four in Iraq after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake jolted the region near the border of the two countries. The US Geological Survey confirmed the quake on its website, placing its epicentre at around 32km outside the Iraqi city of Halabja, and issuing an "orange" alert for "shaking-related fatalities and economic losses". It hit on Sunday at 9.18pm (Monday 7.18am NZ time) and was 33km deep. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit near the Iran-Iraq border. Iranian social media showed numerous people evacuating their homes, especially from the cities of Ghasr-e Shirin, near the Iraqi border, and Kermanshah. Faramarz Akbari, Ghasr-e Shirin's governor, said that six people had died and scores more injured, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Esmail Najar, head of Iran's National Disaster Management Organisation, said "some injured people might be buried under the rubble in Ghasr-e Shirin". The semi-official Iranian ILNA news agency reported that at least 14 provinces had been affected by the earthquake. In Iraq, at least four people died and dozens were wounded, according to the Kurdistan Regional Government's Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed. The most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan, 75 kilometres east of the city of Sulaimaniyah, and more than 30 people were injured in the town. The district's main hospital was severely damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were being taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. #Iraq :Video showing damaged buildings in Darbandikhan area in #Sulaymaniyah after 7.6 magnitude #earthquake pic.twitter.com/5TMsnpj316. \u2014 Ali Al Shouk (@alialshouk) November 12, 2017 .

V San Francisco, Nov 11 - A mountain lion that was reported roaming around an urban residential area in California was caught alive behind a housing complex near San Francisco, authorities said. .  A TV footage showed that the lion was carried away on Friday on a pickup truck after it was shot with tranquilizers with its four paws cuffed and a black bag covering its head, reports Xinhua news agency.  The big cat was spotted slinking around an area of the Diamond Heights village of San Francisco, crouching in the trees behind the homes, before it was cornered by a game warden who shot the animal with a tranquilizer gun.  Local media quoted a police officer at the scene as saying that its was a full grown female mountain lion.  We're all kind of baffled, said Justin Dellinger, a senior environmental scientist. I think we're all a little stumped about how it even got there.  It was not clear whether the feline was the same animal that was seen lurking around the area earlier this week.  Wildlife experts believe the big cat either found its way to San Francisco from wildland areas on the San Francisco Peninsula or sauntered over the Golden Gate Bridge at night.  It is estimated that between 4,000 and 6,000 mountain lions are currently in California, and their territory can extend from 16 to 640 sq.km, according to wildlife officials.  --IANS.  ksk .

VSourav Ganguly has an advice for his junior with which he can perform better in the shortest format of the game.  Aakash Biswas. Nov 12, 2017. Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly has come up with a solution for Mahendra Singh Dhoni with which he could survive in T20Is in a better way. Recently, the Indian wicket-keeper had to face a blow of criticism from some of his retired seniors as he failed to score big and rotate strike during the 2nd T20I against New Zealand in Rajkot. The bunch of former cricketers \u2013 VVS Laxman, Aakash Chopra and Ajit Agarkar, suggested that Dhoni should bid adieu to T20Is. However, skipper Virat Kohli and head coach Ravi Shastri spoke in favour of the former Indian captain and explained his importance in the team. And now Ganguly has an advice for his junior with which he can perform better in the shortest format of the game. As reported by the news agency PTI, he said,. \u201cHis record in T20I is not that good compared to ODIs. Hope Kohli and team management will speak to him separately. He has immense ability. If he approaches T20Is differently, then he will be successful.\u201d. Ganguly also mentioned that Dhoni should continue with the ODIs but in T20Is, he has to think different. He said,. \u201cDefinitely not for One-dayers. I think he should keep playing One-day cricket, but he has to play differently in T20Is. He has to play T20Is freely. It depends on the selectors and how they would like to play him\u201d. When asked about the forthcoming India vs Sri Lanka Test series, Ganguly stated that he\u2019s hoping the series won\u2019t be one sider. He said,. \u201cOf course India are the favourites. They are a much better side than Sri Lanka. Recently they won in Sri Lanka across all formats. I hope it won\u2019t be a one-sided series. The recent (limited overs) series against New Zealand was competitive. Hope Sri Lanka will play well.\u201d.

VVikas Gupta, Parth Samthaan. Parth Samthaan and Vikas Gupta were involved in a raging controversy a couple of years ago when the former alleged that the latter molested him. It later came to notice that they were actually in a relationship for many years after Vikas shared some intimate photos of the two, putting all rumours to rest. It was one murky ordeal but it looks like the two decided to let things go and carry on with their lives after what seemed like an endless saga. Vikas is now on Bigg Boss and has been having a tough time in the house, thanks to his co-contestant Shilpa Shinde, whom he has had a troubled working relationship with. Their fights got so nasty that Salman Khan had to intervene and ask them to calm down and sort out their differences. With the show\u2019s TRPs dipping day by day, the makers are desperately trying all possible ways to bring some life back. They brought Dhinchak Pooja in as a wildcard contestant, but we all know that didn\u2019t go down too well and she was evicted this Sunday. According to a report in Pinkvilla, the makers approached Parth Samthaan to be a part of the show as a wild card contestant. They were reportedly even willing to pay him a huge sum of money, so he\u2019d come face-to-face with his ex-flame Vikas Gupta, but Samthaan denied the offer. He wants to focus on his career instead of getting embroiled in a controversy yet again. Gosh, can you imagine the two on Bigg Boss? DRAMA!.

VBYD Auto will supply 25 fully built electric buses to Himachal Road Transport Corporation as well as six buses to the state-owned transport service BEST in Mumbai. A Chinese bus making company walked away winning two prized contracts of supplying fully electric buses in two different states where Indian companies like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland had keenly bid. BYD Auto Industry, headquartered in Shaanxi, China will supply 25 fully built electric buses to Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) as well as six buses to the state-owned transport service BEST in Mumbai. These eBuzz K7 buses, which cost Rs 2 crore each, are 9 meters long and can seat up to 25 passengers. Their Lithium-ion phosphate-run batteries have a range of 144 miles (230 kms) on a single charge and a top-speed of nearly 90 kms per hour, as per figures announced by the company. With zero tail-pipe emissions these BYD buses will run on routes that are 13,000 feet above sea level coupled with steep gradients. The buses have been certified by the Automotive Research Association of India, the apex homologation-providing body. The. Anand Swaroop, Chief Operating Officer Goldstone Infratech, said, \u201cBYD present are globally in USA, Europe, Australia, Far East. They have more than 30,000 buses running globally. These buses are manufactured in India at Hyderabad and Bangalore.\u201d. Market leaders in buses Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland along with Mahindra & Mahindra had made independent bids for the prestigious HRTC contract. It was the country\u2019s first large electric bus supply order where companies tried to demonstrate technological capabilities. Tata Motors, which is believed to have made bids for the BEST contract as well, had a few electric buses running on a test basis on the ecologically fragile Manali-Rohtang route in Himachal Pradesh. Secunderabad-based, Goldstone Infratech, a leading manufacturer of rubber polymer composite insulators, has partnered BYD to manufacture these buses in India. Deliveries to HRTC started in August this year. \u201cWe have not heard anything from the HP government since the past five months\u201d, a senior Tata Motors official said while talking to Moneycontrol. In April this year a 9-meter bus from Tata Motors, with a seating capacity of 31, was piloted on the Parwanoo-Kalka route with the round-trip distance of 160km with no charging en-route. The state government decided to increase the bus order to 75 buses from the initial 25.  BYD-Goldstone is bidding for similar contracts in Chandigarh while testing in going on in Bengaluru, Pune and Delhi. Indian companies are making a bid for contracts in the same markets.    .

VVictoria and Albert Museum will soon present an exhibition titled "Fashioned from Nature" at their London venue with a focus on fashion\u2019s complex relationship with the natural world since 1600. Among the key items on exhibit will be Emma Watson\u2019s 2016 Met Gala Calvin Klein dress made from recycled plastic bottles, a pineapple fiber clutch-bag, and a cape of cockerel feathers. \u201cFashioned from Nature\u201d will illustrate how fashionable clothing repeatedly draws on the beauty of nature for inspiration and will have garments and accessories from luxury brands such as Christian Dior, Christopher Raeburn, Dries van Noten, Philip Treacy, and Stella McCartney among others. It will explore how fashion\u2019s processes and constant demand for raw materials damage the environment, featuring campaigners and protest groups that have highlighted this issue such as Fashion Revolution and Vivienne Westwood. It will also look at the role of design in creating a better, more sustainable fashion industry. The exhibition will even draw attention to the use of innovative, sustainable fabrics. For instance, Vegea uses grape waste from the wine industry to form a leather-substitute, and their Grape gown will be on the show, as will a Ferragamo ensemble made from "Orange Fiber" extracted from the waste from the Italian citrus industry.

V Achieves hat trick by winning third year in a row at FICCI Educations awards . National Institute of Technology-Tiruchi (NIT-T) has bagged University of the Year award at FICCI Higher Education Summit held in New Delhi on Thursday. . Mini Shaji Thomas, Director, NIT-T, received the award presented by Anil Sahasrabuddhe, Chairman, All India Council of Technical Education, in the presence of M. M Sharma, Professor Emeritus, Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai. A NIT-T press release said that it had achieved a hat trick at the FICCI Educations awards. In 2015, the institute was recognised for excellence in social responsibility category. In 2016, it won two awards for excellence in employability and visionary idea. According to the release, FICCI adopts an elaborate two-stage screening process in selecting top institutes for the awards. Consulting firm Ernst & Young is the knowledge partner for FICCI. The first stage consists of online application which leads to short-listing based on merits of the institute, followed by a final jury evaluation which is based on face-to-face presentation before a high-powered jury chaired by R.A. Mashelkar, an eminent scientist. The institute scored high on many of the yardsticks set for the University of Year award, having undertaken a major academic transformation a couple of years back and figuring almost on top of the list in terms of research publications.  NITT was ranked 11th amongst all technical institutions, including the older IITs and 1st amongst all NITs in the Ministry of Human Resource Development\u2019s National Institutional Ranking Framework during 2017.

VDesi Girl Priyanka Chopra has always made us proud by achieving almost everything in so less time. She is undoubtedly one of the most amazing actresses we have today. By impressing everyone in Bollywood, Priyanka also added another feather in her cap by venturing in Hollywood. But we all know that everyone has to go through their own struggles while climbing the ladder of success. In an interview to Deccan Chronicle, Madhu Chopra, mother of PeeCee, who has always been a great support to her daughter, reveals that Priyanka too had gone through sexual harassment during her early days. Apparently, she lost 10 films as she refused to fulfill director\u2019s wishes. Talking about two such incidents, Madhu said,\u201d She was just 17 when she entered the industry, so I accompanied her every minute of the day till about three years ago. So a gentleman meets her and says: \u2018Will your mother sit outside while I narrate the story to you?\u2019 Priyanka told him, \u2018If it is a story that my mother can\u2019t hear then it is a story that I cannot do.\u2019 She walked out of that project \u2014 a prestigious one.\u201d. Priyanka Chopra Lost 10 Films As She Said No To Sexual Harassment, Says Madhu Chopra. She further added, \u201cAnother time, a designer told her that the director\u2019s brief was to dress her in itsy-bitsy clothes. The director had said, \u2018What is the point of having a Miss World in front of the camera if we cannot show her as her beautiful self?\u2019 Priyanka refused to do the film. It was being helmed by a reputed director and he got upset. Priyanka lost 10 films because she walked out of that project. But she didn\u2019t care. That is what I say to everyone. This is not the end of your life. Your life is more valuable.\u201d. Speaking about her Hollywood journey, Madhu narrated that she didn\u2019t face such issues there. \u201cThey gave Priyanka a lot of respect. If you live on your own terms, the struggle is bigger but the outcome is sweeter too. This is my advice to every girl. Do not compromise and life will be sweeter for you,\u201d she concluded. On the work front, both Madhu and Priyanka have started their own production house, Purple Pebble Pictures. Their first movie as a producer was Ventilator which won several awards and it also garnered a lot of appreciation.

VAnnouncing the launch of Future Relics, an interactive installation that takes participants on a shared journey, connecting the past with the present whilst looking to the future, Google Arts and Culture unveiled its first lab experiment in India on Friday. Part of the landmark \u201cIndia and the World: A History in Nine Stories,\u201d exhibition that opened at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) on Friday, the Future Relics project blends ancient craft and modern technology to build relics for the future. As visitors navigate the museum and come across the Future Relics installation, they will be asked to react to the question: \u201cWhat object would you like archaeologists 1,000 years from now to remember our present day culture by?\u201d Responding directly to India and the World\u2019s exploration of pots as story-telling objects, the Future Relics installation will invite audiences to pause and consider their own lives and stories within the context of the global histories presented by India and the World. Speaking at the launch, Freya Murray, Programme Manager and Creative Lead, Google Cultural Institute Lab said: \u201cGoogle Art and Culture brings cultural treasures of the world to the fingertips of art enthusiasts and culturally curious people. With our first-ever cultural lab experiment in India, we want to craft new bridges between technology and culture whilst giving audiences a new perspective of archeology in the digital age. We hope that visitors will enjoy interacting with Future Relics and becoming a part of a time capsule that will capture, as a growing landscape of pots, the most popular objects reflecting our lives today.\u201d. The contributions of visitors will provide future generations glimpses into the lives and stories of people who lived in the present day, just as the artefacts of the museum give a glimpse of those who lived and ruled in the first cities of India. From thousands of contributions, a collection of artifacts will be created digitally and at the end of the three-month-long exhibition, a special physical collection of 3D printed clay vases will be designed based on visitors\u2019 most popular contributions. The Future Relics project was developed at the Google Cultural Institute Lab, which brings artists and engineers together to explore new ways to experience art and experiment with art and technology. The Lab is part of Google Arts and Culture, a new immersive way to experience art, history, culture and wonders of the world. (MR, Inputs: Agencies).

VCalcutta: Jadavpur and Calcutta universities will apply to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for the "institute of eminence" tag. The UGC had announced in September that it would declare 20 universities in the country, 10 of them government-aided and the rest private, institutions of eminence to enable them to evolve into world-class teaching and research centres. Government institutions ranked among the top 50 by the ministry of human resource development (HRD) would be eligible to apply for the status, the UGC had said. Jadavpur University (JU) was ranked 12 "overall" among the country's premiere institutions, including the IITs, NITs and the IIMs, and state-aided, centrally-funded and private research institutes. The 2017 ranking exercise conducted under the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) put JU in the fifth place among all state and central universities and ninth in engineering. The 20 institutions selected for the eminence status will receive a financial assistance of up to Rs 1,000 crore. "Jadavpur University was ranked high in almost every assessment by agencies such as NIRF and NAAC. Given our high ratings, we should be able to get the eminence status. The process of submitting the application to UGC is on," said Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das. JU is the only institute in the state to be graded A+ by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council), only a notch below the best in the last NAAC assessment of 2014. It scored a CGPA (cumulative grade point average) of 3.68 out of 4. "We have been consistently working towards improving our ranking and that has been apparent whenever we have competed with other institutes in the country. We expect to excel this time too," Das said. Calcutta University (CU) got grade A this year in the NAAC assessment, two notches below the best, scoring a CGPA of 3.2. In 2009, it had scored a CGPA of 3.3. Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee, the CU vice-chancellor, said the university has received a letter from the HRD ministry confirming its eligibility to apply for the eminence status. "We are getting ready with all the information to be supplied to the UGC for seeking the eminence status," she said. The institutes with the status of eminence will be able to decide their fee structure, particularly for foreign students, and curriculum.

VPeanut Butter Lovers, You\u2019re Going to Love These Spreadable Alternatives. For many of us, the love affair began with lunch box peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or after-school apple slices slathered with the nutty spread. Maybe you\u2019ve since found other uses for the salty, creamy food, like blending it in a smoothie or mixing it into a creamy dressing for salad or meat. Or maybe you still keep a jar of peanut butter on hand for that classic PB&J. Whatever the reason you use it, this nut butter delivers when it comes to texture and flavor, along with protein and some good-for-you nutrients to boot. And peanut butter now has some serious competition from other nut butter varieties, from almond butter to cashew butter to tahini, a buttery paste made of ground sesame seeds. All serve up the rich creaminess of peanut butter, but each comes with its own unique flavor, texture, and nutrition brags. "Most have a good amount of fiber and heart-healthy fats," points out Lindsay Malone, RD, with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. But certain varieties are higher in protein or carbohydrates than others. And the different options offer solutions for people with food allergies or sensitivities. Just be careful to avoid varieties with unnecessary calories and added sugars, Malone adds. You don\u2019t want to unknowingly be eating a dessert in disguise!. Here are seven picks that deliver on taste, texture, and nutrition:.

VGareth Southgate has called up goalkeeper Angus Gunn, defender Lewis Cook and striker Dominic Solanke to the squad which will face Brazil. Reuters Photo. Highlights. All three were in action on Friday for England's under-21 side in Ukraine. Manchester City's Gunn will replace Jack Butland, who broke a finger in training. The starting 11 had just 101 caps between them, their most inexperienced side since 1980. England coach Gareth Southgate has called up three more youngsters for the team's home friendly against Brazil on Tuesday. Southgate, who gave five players their international first-team debuts against Germany on Friday, has added goalkeeper Angus Gunn, defender Lewis Cook and striker Dominic Solanke to the squad for Tuesday's Wembley encounter with the five-times World Cup winners. All three were in action on Friday for England's under-21 side in Ukraine -- and the latter two featured in the under-20s' World Cup-winning campaign earlier this year. Manchester City's Gunn, 21, who is on loan at second-tier Norwich City, was called up to replace Jack Butland, who broke a finger in training. Cook, of Bournemouth, and Liverpool's Solanke, both 20, join an already young squad hit by injuries to senior players, including Dele Alli and Harry Kane, and now without Manchester United defender Phil Jones, who limped off after less than half an hour of the Germany match with what England say is a thigh problem. Feel incredibly blessed and honoured to get called up to the @England Senior Squad! Thanks for all the messages!ð?¦?ð?¦?ð?¦?. - Dom Solanke (@DomSolanke) November 11, 2017 . I am incredibly honoured and proud to be called up for the @England senior squad. A huge achievement for me and my family. Thank you for all the kind messages ð?¦?ð?¦?ð?¦?. - Lewis Cook (@lewiscook_) November 11, 2017 . So proud to be called up to the full @england squad. Itâ??s the stuff dreams are made of and I would like to thank everybody who has helped me get this far!ð?¦?ð?¦?ð?¦?. - Angus Gunn (@AngusGunn01) November 11, 2017 . Harry Maguire, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham all made their senior debuts on Friday and were joined by two more debutants -- substitutes Joe Gomez and Jack Cork -- during the game. The starting 11 had just 101 caps between them -- their most inexperienced side since 1980.

VDavis is one of a few healthy receiving options available for Washington. We break down the fantasy impact. . Veteran tight end Vernon Davis is one of only three receiving options not to show up on Washington\u2019s injury report this week as the team prepares to host the Minnesota Vikings Sunday. Washington\u2019s starting TE, Jordan Reed, is questionable to play with a hamstring issue, but he did practice Thursday. Davis will lose targets if Reed is in the lineup. He has a tough matchup with the Vikings either way. . In Week 9, Davis started for Reed and caught six passes for 72 yards. He led the team in targets, receptions, and yards in the win over the Seattle Seahawks. . Fantasy impact: Davis is one of the most solid fantasy TEs in the league. Once again he is in limbo with Reed\u2019s status up in the air. If Reed plays, Davis will see a dip in targets. However, he is still one of the most secure receiving options in Washington. It will be a hard road against Minnesota, but Davis should be in your lineup this week, especially if Reed is out. . Recommendation: Start.

VJaipur: The Rajasthan police intensified its crackdown on striking doctors on Saturday and took action against 14 doctors under the Rajasthan Essential Services Maintenance Act (RESMA). According to additional DGP (law and order) N R K Reddy, as many as 100 doctors joined for duty after police teams raided their houses. "Action was taken against 14 doctors, some have been arrested while others have been detained," Reddy said. Sources informed TOI that widespread raids were being conducted across the state at government quarters and private houses of leaders of the All Rajasthan In-Service Doctors' Association (ARISDA). Many striking doctors have already gone into hiding to evade arrest. In Jaipur, the police arrested one Dr Daya Ram Soni from Adarsh Nagar on late Friday night. On Saturday morning, another doctor was picked up from Bani Park area. In Bundi and Churu too, police arrested or booked striking doctors. Many doctors had gone underground after the last talks failed between the medical department and leaders of the ARISDA. An official informed TOI that the police crackdown began after all options were exhausted by the government. "Several rounds of talks were held with the doctors and most of their demands were met. But the leaders of the in-service doctors' association kept dilly dallying which not only impeded the health services but also the final resolution," said an official. The home department had directed the Rajasthan police to crack a whip on defiant doctors. The police crackdown created a panic among doctors and many of them went into hiding. "We are tracing the mobile phones of doctors but they have switched them off. The leaders of ARISDA have also gone into hiding," said an official. When the police raided the hideouts of striking doctors, many promised to return to work and pleaded with cops not to arrest them. The Rajasthan government imposed RESMA on striking doctors on Sunday. Under the Act, if the state government can prohibit strikes in any essential service in public interest. A person participating in a strike which is illegal under RESMA may face imprisonment of up to six months.

VNew Delhi: Gold prices dipped by Rs 80 to Rs 30,450 per 10 grams at the bullion market today, tracking a weak trend overseas amid easing demand from local jewellers. Silver eased further by Rs 175 to Rs 40,400 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units and coin makers. Traders said apart from a weak trend overseas, fall in demand from local jewellers and retailers at existing levels led to the decline in gold prices. Globally, gold fell by 0.75 per cent to USD 1,274.90 an ounce and silver by 0.53 per cent to USD 16.86 an ounce in New York in yesterday\u2019s trade. In the national capital, gold of 99.9 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity drifted lower by Rs 80 each to Rs 30,450 and Rs 30,300 per 10 grams, respectively. The precious metal had gained Rs 80 yesterday. Sovereign, however, ruled flat at Rs 24,700 per piece of eight grams. In a similar fashion, silver ready moved down by Rs 175 to Rs 40,400 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 160 to Rs 39,500 per kg. Silver coins, however, remained unaltered at Rs 74,000 for buying and Rs 75,000 for selling of 100 pieces. (PTI0.

V To study microgravity's effect on bacterial antibiotic resistance, scientists are set to send E. coli, a common bacterial pathogen linked to urinary tract infections and foodborne illnesses, to the International Space Station (ISS).  The E. coli AntiMicrobial Satellite (EcAMSat) mission is scheduled to launch to the ISS on Orbital ATK's Cygnus cargo spacecraft on Saturday along with a slew of other science experiments and supplies for the Expedition 53 crew, Space.com reported.  Antibiotic resistance could pose a danger to astronauts, especially since microgravity has been shown to weaken human immune response, NASA said. .  The E. coli AntiMicrobial Satellite mission will investigate spaceflight effects on bacterial antibiotic resistance and its genetic basis. .  The experiment will expose two strains of E. coli, one with a resistance gene, the other without, to three different doses of antibiotics, then examine the viability of each group.  "Results from this investigation could contribute to determining appropriate antibiotic dosages to protect astronaut health during long-duration human spaceflight and help us understand how antibiotic effectiveness may change as a function of stress on Earth," NASA said.  Rather than being housed inside the space station, this experiment will take place in a 6U cubesat, a small satellite that has six times the volume of a single cubesat. .  The fundamental scenario of the experiment protocol will start four days after launch of the EcAMSat satellite by allowing an initial growth and then starvation period for E. coli bacteria contained in 48 microfluidic wells. .  The investigation aims to determine "the lowest dose of antibiotic needed to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterial pathogen that causes infections in humans and animals," NASA officials wrote in a description of the experiment. .  --IANS gb/vm.

VThe movie will have two heroines who will have very strong characters.  Director and producer Sameer Bharath Ram is currently working on a full-length feature film. But the twist is that it is not any other film, but Kaaka Muttai director, Manikandan's short film, Meendum Oru Punagai. .   "I had a couple of scripts in mind, and even had a script ready. But I watched this film and thought the short film can definitely become a full length feature because the content is very relevant to today's world. It is an urban romance, a simple story, but the screenplay will hold the story together," shares Sameer, who is really happy that he is working with an amazing team. After all, the untitled movie will have dialogues by Nalan Kumarasamy and the screenplay is by Manikandan himself. .  As for the hero, Sameer has chosen Arav of Bigg Boss fame for the lead role. "I thought Arav will be good for the role. The movie will have two heroines who will have very strong characters. We are planning to start the shoot by 2018," he says. But what prompted him to choose the short film for his first feature movie? "If I have to expand, the movie is based on how relationships are today. Back then, people had lesser opportunities to meet new people and interact with them, but with the advent of technology there are so many new platforms where you can meet new people and connect with them. The movie is about how you manage a relationship, how easy it is to lose interest and how it starts affecting your current relationship," he shares. .

Similarly, the company's standalone revenue from operations increased to Rs 12,182.07 crore from Rs 11,446.14 crore earned during Q2 of last fiscal.

"India has seen macro-economic stability with low inflation and steady push to the reforms momentum. Green shoots of economic recovery will likely become visible in the latter half of the year. Growth momentum is likely to witness a cyclical bounce-back once the effects of some of the recent transient factors fade away and the economy adjusts to GST implementation," the company said in its outlook. "Inventory restocking, a normal monsoon and the lagged effect of past interest rate cuts will continue to provide a fillip to growth going forward.".

VNew Delhi , Nov 11 : Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) Administrator Justice (Retired) Vikramjit Sen has said that former Test opener Gautam Gambhir's appointment as the government nominee in the cricket body's managing committee can be questioned under conflict of interest clauses currently in place in the sport.  The DDCA is currently being administered the Delhi High Court-appointed Justice (Retired) Vikramajit Sen. Justice Vikramajit Sen told ANI that the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs may have to reconsider Gambhir's appointment as he is still playing first-class cricket. Justice Sen said, "They may want to reconsider the appointment because of the clash of interest.". The Lodha Committee recommendations on conflict of interest purview could be applicable in Gambhir's case as he is a part of the policy making body before retiring from the game. Justice Sen, however, said Gambhir's appointment will not come into effect until the DDCA elections are over. "Well, right now, they have to wait till the elections are over. The appointment doesn't take effect until the elections are held," he said. "This is for them to decide whether a person who is still a cricketer would be an appropriate choice as a nominee," Sen said, adding, "In a manner of speech he will be becoming a judge in his own court, so that would become a conflict of interest.". The administrator further informed that if Gambhir were to retire, then may be his selection would be beyond criticism. Gambhir on Friday announced his appointment on Twitter, saying, "Had the honour of adjusting fields at Ferozeshah Kotla. Time to adjust 'corridors' at DDCA to help restore its glory days. Honoured to be Government Nominee on DDCA Managing Committee. Thanks @Ra_THORe #humbled." .

VScuderia Toro Rosso has his back at Renault\u2019s suggestion that the recent engine issues affecting the team have been due to how it operates the French manufacturer's power units. The Italian team has suffered a string of failures in recent races, with both Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley taking grid penalties for Brazil and then hitting further problems right at the start of FP1. Speaking to Motorsport.com on Thursday, Renault Sport F1 boss Cyril Abiteboul said "we do have a little bit of a concern about the way that our engine is operated in the Toro Rosso car", adding that there are "never coincidences in this sport". In a statement released on Friday, STR insisted that the problems had nothing to do with the installation or how the team is operating the engine. "It comes as a big surprise to the team that Cyril Abiteboul has suggested to the media that the problems Toro Rosso suffers with the power unit are primarily team-related, and the way in which the power unit is operated in the STR12 chassis. "We would like to clarify that all the MGU-H and Shaft failures Toro Rosso has recently suffered are not associated with how the team is operating or with how the PU is integrated in the chassis. "Nothing has been changed or altered in this installation during the 2017 season, other than cooling improvements mid-season. "Since the summer break, Toro Rosso has suffered continuous power unit related failures, and the resulting grid penalties has cost the team points and relative positions in the Constructors' championship.". The team highlighted the fact it was forced to re-use old parts due to a shortage of new ones as a major issue contributing to the situation. "One of the primary reasons for the issues we are seeing is the lack of new power unit parts available. "In Toro Rosso's case, the team is constantly having to change parts from one PU to another during the weekend and, on many occasions, is forced to run old-specification assemblies. "The last race in Mexico saw only two [Renault-powered] cars out of six finish the race, highlighting the poor reliability.". The team also made an intriguing reference to the battle for sixth in the constructors' championship, with STR currently five points ahead of Renault. "We mustn't forget that they are fighting with Toro Rosso for a better position in the Constructors' championship," the statement read. "As suggested by Mr. Abiteboul the situation may not be a coincidence, but it is certainly not due to STR's car.".

V MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested an Australian national for trying to fly with a satellite phone found in hand baggage on Thursday. The suspect, Carton Peter (58), a businessman was about to take a connecting flight to Indore from the Mumbai International Airport when the immigration officials stopped him at the immigration check. Police arrested Peter and asked him to be present before the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Friday where he was granted bail. .   Peter, who is on a business tour reached Mumbai airport on Friday from other country and was supposed to take a flight to Indore when he was stopped by the CISF officials during the security check. "The CISF official got suspicious on seeing some instrument in Peter's bag that was put for X Ray scan. The officials alerted his senior officer and showed the satellite phone and handed over to the police for further probe," said a police officer of the Sahar police station. .  Lawyer Prabhakar Tripathi said his client was not in knowledge that satellite phone is banned in India. "He honestly replied to the official during the immigration check at the airport when asked that it is a satellite phone. He has come to India on a business tour," said Tripathi. Peter has been booked under the Indian Wireless & Telegraph Act. He has been released on Rs15000 bail. .  On October 2, US national Banghrat Edgar was caught with a satellite phone (which is ban in India) that was found in his handbag during the security check at the airport. Edgar has claimed that he carried the satellite phone along with him to communicate with his family members during his stay at Nepal.

V A grouping of stock brokers has termed Sebi\u2019s directive of compulsorily keeping records of telephonic communications with clients as \u2018not practical\u2019 since that would be difficult in terms of identification and retrieval. Voicing concerns over the directive, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), in a letter to Sebi, also said monitoring of communications with clients would be difficult as multiple modes, including mobile phones and WhatsApp messenger, are used for placing orders.  \u201cTelephone recording is very difficult to have at every dealer\u2019s terminals, with accuracy of voice identification and also retrieval at the time of need,\u201d the letter stated. The share prices change fast and many clients trade by directly communicating with the dealer, and asking such clients for written orders every time will be very cumbersome and is not investor friendly, the association said.  Furthermore, many orders are modified or cancelled at the direction of a client and matching recording of original orders with modification and cancellation instructions is also very difficult, it added. \u201cBoth the premier exchanges put together, there are 13.9 million number of daily trades on an average. Looking at the volume in the market, such system of written order/recording is not practical,\u201d said the letter.  To prevent unauthorised trading activities, Sebi in September had asked brokers to compulsorily \u201cuse telephone recording system to record the instructions and maintain telephone recordings\u201d in case the client is giving the orders.  The brokers have been asked to execute trades of clients only after keeping evidence of the client placing such an order. The evidence could be physical record written and signed by the client, telephone recording, e-mail from authorised ID, log for Internet transactions, record of SMS messages or any other legally verifiable record.  The onus will be on stock brokers to produce proof of clients' activities in the event of any dispute arising out of a stock trade. The directive will be effective January 1, 2018. ANMI said the \u2018existing system of post trade communication with the client with respect to his executed trade is better\u2019. Instead of only informing value of trade in numeric figures, the communication should also include details of the quantity and scrips traded. .

VChief minister Raghubar Das and Union minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha enjoy a boat ride in Patratu dam on Saturday.  RAMGARH: Chief minister Raghubar Das on Saturday laid the foundation of the first phase of the Rs 200-crore Patratu Lake Resort project near the Patratu dam in Ramgarh. Das said similar such resorts, called Jharkhand Resorts, will be set up at various tourist spots across the state. .  "Jharkhand has immense potential to develop itself into a world-class tourism hub and strengthen the economy to eradicate poverty by 2022. The state government plans to hand over the world-class tourist centres to local villagers, who will run them by forming a trust comprising the residents and panchayat representatives," Das said. .  Spread over 120 acres, the Patratu Lake Resort is scheduled to be completed in three phases within the next 13 months. Das said, "The state has lakes, dams, waterfalls, pilgrimages, forests and lush hills. We have identified several spots to be developed into international tourist hubs." .  Das said the Jharkhand Resorts will offer world-class facilities to the visitors. He added, "The state is developing a tourist circuit connecting Bodh Gaya in Bihar and Itkhori in Chatra district to attract tourist from Buddhist countries. We will develop a religious tourism circuit between Rampur and Maluti in Pakur district and Deoghar and Bauskinath temple. The Rajrappa temple would be developed on the lines of Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu & Kashmir." .  Das along with minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha, water resources, drinking water and sanitation minister Chandra Prakash Chaudhary and tourism minister Amar Kumar Bauri went for boating in the Patratu dam. .  Sinha said along with tourism, Patratu will also become a centre of industries as the NTPC has proposed to invest Rs 20,000 crore to set up India's biggest power plant here. .  Bauri said the number of foreign tourists visiting Jharkhand has increased by 200% between 2013 and 2016. .

VIf you can\u2019t stand bitter beers, you could be a supertaster. . We already know that people who prefer bitter flavors like those in IPAs are more likely to be antisocial sadists, but it turns out that we IPA-haters are also more likely to be supertasters. Doesn\u2019t that have a nice ring to it?. About half of the population is made up of normal tasters, while 25% of us are nontasters, and the remaining 25% are supertasters. Unfortunately, being a supertaster isn't as great as the name suggests. "You might think that a supertaster would have a lot of fun eating and drinking, but it\u2019s more like the opposite," writes Dr. Rob DeSalle of the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomic. "Because supertasters experience tastes more intensely than nontasters and tasters, the effects of different tastes detected by tongues of supertasters are amplified relative to the nontasters and tasters." According to Lifehacker: .  That means bitter drinks like beer, especially IPAs, are extremely bitter to the supertasting population. The intense flavor of the hops and taste of the alcohol is too much to handle. When it comes to other stiff drinks, like liquor, supertasters can\u2019t handle the burn there either. And if you\u2019re part of the incredibly small group of extreme supertasters (less than 1% of the population), even lighter beers like lagers are often too bitter to \u201cdevelop a taste for.\u201d So, if you can\u2019t stand IPAs, but can manage sipping on some lighter brews, you might be a supertaster. . There you have it\u2014 you don\u2019t have the palate of an eight-year-old, you\u2019re just a super taster. .

VIt can result in infection of the hair follicle too. Representative Image: Getty Images.  The most common type of ear hair is the one that grows out from the edge of the ear canal and excess of it can result in infection of the hair follicle which can be painful to get rid of all these unwanted hairs smartly.  Batul Patel, medical director and Dermatologist of The Bombay Skin Clinic and Narmada Matang, Dermatologist at Neo Skin Clinic, outline some ways of getting rid of unwanted ear hair. * Trimming: A battery operated lightweight trimmer with a skin guard can be used twice or thrice a week depending on the growth of the hair. Also, avoid using sharp scissors as any cuts can lead to permanent scars. * Hair removal creams: Even though using depilatory creams seems like an easier option it can lead to itching and can make the treated areas highly sensitive. Also, there's a risk of pushing the cream deep into your ear canals which can potentially damage the sensitive skin inside. * Tweezers: This method of hair removal is very time consuming and can be very painful. Also, there's a risk of damaging your hair follicle which can lead to infection. * Laser hair removal: The laser hair removal device destroys the hair follicle without damaging the skin. Before the procedure, the hair is shaved using a razor followed by application of a cold gel. The laser handpiece is then placed directly above the ear followed by the emission of a laser shot which is generally painless depending on the laser used. It needs to be done once a month and typically requires 6 to 8 treatment sessions for the hair to disappear.  An interesting fact to note is that this works only on black pigment hair, so if you've grey or white hair you will not be able to laser them away. It's a quick service and requires just 15 minutes to do the procedure. Use sun protection post laser. .

V Hi, I've been experiencing from what i would describe as dizzy spells for quite some time now (as in a few years) they come and go and are quite random however 9 times out of 10 they will occur within a minite or so of sit-standing, from what i can recall they tend to occur more in the afternoon than in the morning and i dont necessarily get them everyday. I might get a couple in a day then not have any for a while... So it makes it hard for me to put my Finger on what actually causes it. Basically when i experience these "dizzy spells" i get the sudden feeling of warm blood rushing kind if like a heat flush but i dont sweat. Everything goes brown - i lose my vision for roughly 5-10 seconds then it the brown slowly fades and i regain full vision. I feel like im going to lose my leg in and i often have to grab onto something close by. Whether that means i fall against a wall, or i press up against something, or i just stand completely still and try not to collapse. A couple of times i have been close by to the couch or bed and ive allowed myself to just collapse into it and i havent felt a thing, it could of been the floor and i wouldnt have known. Ive never actually lost consiousness. A couple of times ive been in mid conversation and tried to keep my composure and to my knowledge i have but i dont know if my eyes deviated or anything... I must admit i dont drink as much water as i should on a daily basis and i do have 1 or 2 cans of diet coke a day. I eat relativley well (im a recoverying bulimic) and i dont exersise all that much anymore (i used to do a lot of sport and fittness) but for the past 6 years its slowly decreased. I'm a 21yo female and am roughly 162 cms tall and weigh 62-65 kgs (at the moment im 63 but my weight can fluctuate between 2-4kgs a day this is not uncommon to me and has been something that i can always remeber to be the case) I take a stimulant for concentration (PRN i take it when i need it) usually 15mg of dexamphetamine once daily 3 times .

VRoyal Enfield has recently unwrapped its new motorcycles - Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 - and in an interview with Autocar, the company's CEO Siddhartha Lal revealed that they are developing three new platforms. Is the iconic brand working on a new bike? Well, that won't be the case. Mr. Lal confirmed that some of the new platforms are being developed to replace the existing ones. With new and stricter emission norms set to be implemented in the next three years, Royal Enfield wants to be ready with new chassis. The brand recently unveiled its all-new 650cc parallel twin engine at its new UK technology centre, and this could power some of the upcoming bikes, including a 650cc Himalayan. The 650cc parallel twin, air/ oil cooled engine churns out 46bhp and 52Nm of torque paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox. Recommended Video. EICMA 2017: Royal Enfield Interceptor And Continental GT Unveiled - DriveSpark. Later at EICMA 2017 Milan Motorcycle Show, the company revealed its new motorcycles. The Royal Enfield twins will go on sale in April 2018 in European markets first and then the Indian market. Also, Mr. Lal said that when the time comes, they will look to develop electric bikes as well, but for now they will concentrate on offering "simple, pared-back, heritage-driven, accessible motorcycling that's missing in the world. This is the path that we're on right now. You are not going to see the likes of a supersport from us for the next five to seven years.". DriveSpark Thinks!. Royal Enfield is preparing itself for the future especially with stricter emission norms set to be implemented in India. While we expect at least two of the three to replace existing ones, the other could be for the Himalayan 650cc, which is being considered for retail.

V London, Nov 12 - Did you just fight with your friend and are you seeking some relaxation to reduce your stress level? Take heart and try the blue light therapy. .  Blue lighting accelerates the relaxation process after acute psychosocial stress in comparison with the conventional white lighting, new research says.  Psychosocial stress or the 'said stress' is a kind of short-term stress (acute stress) that occurs during social or interpersonal relationships, for example while arguing with a friend or when someone pressures you to finish a certain task as soon as possible.  Psychosocial stress produces physiological responses or the physical response to a stimulus that can be measured by means of bio-signals, mentioned in the research led by Francisco Pelayo, professor at the University of Granada, Spain.  The researchers asked the volunteers to be under high stress for the study and then evaluated them over a relaxation session within a multisensory stimulation room.  The participants were divided in two groups, the first group lied down under blue light and the second group lied down under white light.  Diverse bio-signals, such as heart rate and brain activity, were measured throughout the whole session by means of an electrocardiogram and an electroencephalogram respectively.  The research, published in the journal Plos One, stated that any form of stress was very common and negatively affected people's health and quality of life.  The results found that participants who lied down under blue light relaxed more quickly than those who were under white light.  --IANS.  ng/ksk/mr .

"I personally don't believe that, primarily because the plus-size industry brings in billions of dollars each year, and the potential profit companies would make should counter any of their hesitations.".

A British inventor has set a new Guinness World Record with his Iron Man-style jet pack which achieved the fastest speed in a body controlled jet engine powered suit. Richard Browning, founder and chief test pilot of British tech company Gravity Industries, set the record in the UK.

Browning achieved an impressive speed of 51.53 kilometres per hour. The Iron Man-style suit is made up of six kerosene- fuelled micro gas turbines, which each have 22 kg of thrust. The jet pack is manoeuvred by human body movement alone to control the flight path of its wearer there is no remote control device used to steer the suit. Browning had to practice core strength exercises prior to the attempt to make sure he was able to balance and hold his position in the air while flying. "I am delighted we have set the record. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have our unique creation recognised and celebrated all round the world," Browning said. .

V125 artists created 65,000 hand-painted frames over the course of 6 years for the sole purpose of this film.  To even attempt emulating the work of one of the most influential figures in modern Western art is a remarkable task in itself. But take a moment to appreciate its sheer audacity - 125 artists created 65,000 hand-painted frames over the course of 6 years for the sole purpose of this film. An undertaking of this magnitude isn't likely to be replicated anytime soon because one would be hardpressed to find a more compelling reason for such an effort. This dictates how the film should be experienced; as a cinematic work of art. .  Gorgeous paintings merge with each other to create dreamlike sequences that allow us to perceive what the world probably looked like through the eyes of the quintessential tortured artist. At the request of his father, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) sets out to deliver a letter from the deceased Van Gogh to his brother Theo. He comes across key figures in Van Gogh's portraits, who reveal aspects of the artist's final days before his passing. The film loses momentum as Armand embarks on his journey of self-discovery amidst trying to unveil the real reason behind the apparent suicide. Jumping back and forth in time during various phases of Van Gogh's life, the broad brushstrokes eventually begin to give some insights into his troubled psyche. .    Sadly, the plot isn't as taut as it should be, and the air of mystery isn't as compelling as the imagery used to paint the whole picture. This is undoubtedly a tall order, and should not dissuade viewers from the visual indulgence. Aided by a fine score courtesy Clint Mansell, your patience will be rewarded as long as you focus on the presentation beyond the slow pacing and all the conjecture. That itself is worth the price of admission for what will remain a significant cinematic achievement.  .

VMihir Bhanage | . Story: When a pseudo-godman wrongs her family, Mukta vows to avenge the wrongdoing. But, will she succeed in her plan?. Review: Just because social films have worked well in the Marathi industry doesn't mean every such film will strike a chord. Maza Algaar tries to uncover the truth behind fake godmen and their shady businesses. A few years ago, the Vaibhav Tatwawadi starrer Surajya tried doing the same. And while the latter was well made, Maza Algaar ends up being a shoddy attempt. Mahant (Swapnil Rajshekhar), a self-proclaimed Messiah, runs a school and ashram in a remote village. He is worshipped by the villagers but his true identity is something entirely different. Under the pretence of doing social work, Mahant runs a flesh-trade racket, hidden in plain sight. When social worker Nupur tries to uncover the truth, he is killed. A young girl named Mukta escapes from the clutches of the godman and swears to avenge the death of her father at the hands of Mahant. Helping her is her childhood friend Manya (Kadam). In a supremely slow paced plot filled with actors who overact, there are just a few scenes that stand out. Apart from this, Maza Algaar is a tedious watch. Despite the story having the potential to have had a lasting impact, the patchy execution hampers it. Swapnil Rajshekhar as Mahant is convincing. The lead actress, debutant Aishwarya Rajesh, appears to be sincere and shows spark but needs to hone her potential. As expected, the story ends on a positive note but it's all too convenient and predictable. Ultimately, the film doesn't hold your attention for long and you are left questioning the whole point of the more than two-hour long running time.

VPyongyang [North Korea], November 11 (ANI): North Korea lashed out at United States President Donald Trump and labeled him "destroyer" who "begged for nuclear war" during his tour of Asia. The state-run Korean Central News Agency in a statement said, "Trump, during his visit, laid bare his true nature as destroyer of the world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula.". Trump is in Vietnam as part of his 12-day tour of Asia, and North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has been a major talking point with his Japanese, South Korean and Chinese">Chinese counterparts. According to reports, Trump had warned North Korea on Wednesday not to underestimate the United States as he wrapped up his visit to South Korea. Earlier, at the outset of this tour, Trump, in an interview broadcast stated he would "certainly be open" to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang described Trump's trip as "nothing but a business trip by a warmonger to enrich the monopolies of the US defense industry.". "It is also nothing but a business trip by a warmonger to enrich the monopolies of the US defense industry by milking the moneybags from its subordinate allies," the statement added. The statement also referred to Trump as dotard, a word the isolated nation has used on him in the past as well. The US and North Korea have long been engaged in back-and-forth barbs over the latter's threat of a nuclear attack. Trump threatened to rain "fire and fury" on North Korea and also called Kim Jong-un as "Little Rocket Man", while North Korea denounced Trump as a "mentally deranged US dotard.". North Korea jolted major world leaders when it carried out the strongest of its six-ever nuclear tests in early September, claiming to have used a hydrogen bomb.(ANI).

VNew Delhi: The Supreme Court collegium will take a call on appointing 40 new judges to nine courts, a senior functionary said even as 106 judges have been appointed to the constitutional courts this year. The law ministry has forwarded recommendations from nine high courts to appoint 40 judges to the Supreme Court collegium.  The high courts from where the recommendations have been received include Karnataka, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Madras and Tripura, the functionary said. According to law ministry data, as on September 1, while the approved strength of judges in the 24 high courts was 1,079, there were 413 vacancies and these high courts were functioning with an effective working strength of 666 judges. As per procedure, the three-member high court collegium recommends a name to the Supreme Court collegium. The recommendation is initially sent to the law ministry, which attaches an IB report about the candidate\u2019s record and forwards it to the SC collegium for a final call. The collegium had recently said the judiciary and not the IB, is a better judge of who should be part of the judiciary.

VNew York, Nov 11 (IANS): Genetics plays a strong role in how people explore the environment visually, says a study that tracked the eye movement of twins. "People recognise that gaze is important," said Daniel Kennedy, Assistant Professor at Indiana University Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences in the US. "Our eyes are moving constantly, roughly three times per second. We are always seeking out information and actively engaged with our environment, and ultimately where you look affects your development," Kennedy said. The researchers compared the eye movements of 466 children -- 233 pairs of twins (119 identical and 114 fraternal) -- between ages 9 and 14 as each child looked at 80 snapshots of scenes people might encounter in daily life, half of which included people. Using an eye tracker, the researchers then measured the sequence of eye movements in both space and time as each child looked at the scene. Published in the journal Current Biology, the study found a strong similarity in gaze patterns within sets of identical twins, who tended to look at the same features of a scene in the same order. It found a weaker but still pronounced similarity between fraternal twins. This suggests a strong genetic component to the way individuals visually explore their environments. The more robust similarity in the eye movements of identical twins is likely due to their shared genetic makeup, the researchers said. The researchers also found that they could reliably identify a twin with their sibling from among a pool of unrelated individuals based on their shared gaze patterns -- a novel method they termed "gaze fingerprinting.". "Eye movements allow individuals to obtain specific information from a space that is vast and largely unconstrained. It's through this selection process that we end up shaping our visual experiences," Kennedy said.

VVayuvegula Subrahmanyam, EMESCO Books Pvt Ltd, `150.  Books on contemporary socio-political developments have always been double-edged swords. It always has the unenviable goal of keeping the audience engaged and if done well, asking for more. On the other, if it fails to satisfy the already built-up expectations of its readers, then it earns the sobriquet of being a \u2018quickie\u2019 and one that just wanted to exploit the timeliness of the incident or development that had taken place to its advantage and unsuccessful in doing so! . Curiously, the run-up to the birth of the 29th State of independent India had not ignited too much of interest in publishing circles, even though it was a 21st century happening. The spread of the digital media had made the separate statehood movement a well-covered issue, at least in the final stages of the agitation in the earlier part of this decade. Yet, barring a handful of journalist-turned-authors and academics doubling up as historians, none came up with a deserving tribute to the cause of why it necessitated creating/demerging a State out of the undivided one of Andhra Pradesh, six decades after they were brought together in 1948, merging Telangana into Andhra Pradesh. Hence, Vayuvegula Subrahmanyam\u2019s \u2018Telangana \u2013 times of turbulence, triumph\u2019 is a welcome addition to the list of books on the new State, which is already in the national focus for both right and wrong things. A seasoned journalist who confesses that he has never written more than 2,000 words at a stretch as part of his professional requirement has gone the distance, courtesy his publisher, and come up with a 287-page book. Kudos to him on this effort in the first place!. Since the author himself confesses his book should be seen and approached as a narrative rather than a chronicle or a coffee-table version, the sequencing of the developments with a historical mention and stopping it with the day when it obtains a Presidential nod seems justified. . As the back cover blurb makes a mention of one of the sentences penned by the author \u2018All said and done, the introduction of Telangana Bill was on a hot and peppery note with members getting scarred and their eyes burning\u2019, it has enough to make the reader recount the event-laden days which the Telugu population saw, before the D-day was experienced in real time.

VPHOTO: EXPRESS. LAHORE: The three-day Eighth International Trust for History, Art and Architecture of Pakistan (THAAP) conference kicked off on Friday. The over-arching theme of the conference \u2013 the city as an evolving organism \u2013 is to explore how urban centres grow and unfold through a process that might be called the \u2018Interaction of the Social and Built Environment (ISBE)\u2019. As many as 24 papers will be presented by researchers, policymakers, scientists, urban science experts and students at the event, which is being organised in collaboration with the Government College University. Participants looked into the questions such as people\u2019s understanding of cities and furthering the dawn of new urban centres. According to the researchers, cities are a physical and a cultural event. \u201cPeople construct cities, and the city, in turn, influences and modulates their living.\u201d. The participants were of the view that tolerance, civil behaviour, respect for others are the keys to the new code as a city is simply not about building and rebuilding an infrastructure anymore. The future lies in a compassionate and a humane city with reduced inequities of power and wealth. The first paper of the session, titled Appeasing Cities: Female Consciousness in Three Pakistani Poets by Dr Nadia Anjum from Kinnaird College for Women, explored the role of women in society and the importance of poetry in reclaiming lost identities. The second paper of the session was presented by Nida Mansoor, head of the department of Aitchison College-Middle School. The paper titled Bazaar \u2013 A Living Museum: Bazaar as an Open Educational Resource explained about the effectiveness of the bazaar as an educational resource. Mahrukh Bajwa of the National College of Arts Lahore presented a paper analysing the folk tradition of puppetry (Putli Tamasha) in Punjab as a form of storytelling in the context of urbanisation. The paper was about the dying puppetry tradition in the context of preserving oral history traditions. Sami Chohan from Karachi presented a paper on Architects as Urbanists: Keeping the City First. It is about the role of architects as urbanists and taking charge of the surrounding environment. The last paper of day one was presented by Dr Michal Glikson from Australia. Her paper titled Visionary Ecologies: Stories of Gleaning in Brisbane and Lahore outlined the importance of cleaners in Lahore and the management of waste. The THAAP, established in 2006, is a forum where multi-disciplinary discourses take place for academics and professionals who are dedicated to improving the state of education, particularly in the fields of art and culture.

VThe Elephant parade comes to India. Thank God they decided to have artists and fashion designers and a few corporate houses like Good Earth because the choice of India's artists shows that they have no idea of what do to when it comes to painting a pachyderm. Going by the success of the Elephant Parade in London it is the fashion designers who will set the bells ringing when it is finally auctioned in Mumbai. . On the occasion of World Elephant Day 2017, Elephant Parade will take place in India from November 2017 to March 2018. As part of the 2017 UK India Year of Culture, Elephant Parade India aims to generate vital funds to secure 101 elephant corridors across India, for the endangered Asian elephants who face the risk of displacement through fragmentation of habitat and human disturbances. . Following 21 successful Elephant Parades worldwide, Elephant Parade India has engaged leading Indian artists, fashion designers, design institutes, tribal painters, and celebrities to turn 101 elephant sculptures into unique masterpieces, creating a striking spectacle of color to celebrate one of India's most beloved and endangered animals. The painted elephants will be displayed in herds at prominent cities in India to be photographed, hugged and kissed by admiring audiences as part of what has become recognized as the world's biggest public art event. After the public displays across the cities, the elephants will then be sold at two high profile auctions in Mumbai and London to raise funds for their endangered wild cousins and their forest homes. A closer look shows that it is Anita Dongre, Tarun Tahiliani, Manish Arora , Seema Kohli, Bajju Shyam Prabhakar Pachpute Rupali Patil and the Good Earth team, that have indeed created elephants that have the richness of intent and the aesthetics of design in being a testimony to the power of bringing life to a venture that will create design statements in colours and tones and graphic splendor. I use the term graphic splendor because sadly speaking, a number of artists chosen did not do justice to the act of painting. A lot of them painted the poor creature like a kitsch ridden inanimate object, not even worthy to be crooned over. The design dictates failed to emulate any grade of interest or intrigue. Perhaps, the best in the juxtaposition of the wildlife intent with an insignia of the culture of caring for the animal . that is on an endangered list in Africa after 100,000 perishing for ivory tusks, is the design by Anita Dongre called Dappu Juju. While Good Earth's Van Vaibhav is a masterpiece of deep interest in Bajju Shyam's tribal notations and textures as well as the brilliant tree of life web of networks and characters of Seema Kohli's vedic compositional patterns.

VRepresentational image. LONDON: In a recent study conducted by the Michigan State University, the golden rules of wine pairing should be thrown out of the window. The reason being, according to the researchers people fit into one of four different wine-drinking preference categories, better known as vinotypes, according to The Independent. According to the study, the four categories are \u2013.  1) Sweet - Very picky about their wines. These people want their wines to be sweet, light, and not too strong. More than 70 per cent of these drinkers are women. They also typically love soda, and excess salt. 2) Hypersensitive \u2013 They are somewhat similar to the people in the sweet, picky category. But they are slightly more open minded about exploring new wines - provided they\u2019re simple and clean. Experts believe that these people are most likely to complain about TV volume and thermostat temperature. 3) Sensitive \u2013 In the middle of the wine-drinking spectrum, are people who are sensitive. They are flexible and adventurous. The researchers say these people will also tend to display signs of being free-spirited and less rigid in everyday life. 4) Tolerant - People in this category demand intensity from their wines, big bold flavours, and just don\u2019t get how others like drinking 'wimpy' wines. They tend to be decisive and more linear thinkers. Their wine preferences point to rich, very intensely flavoured whites and full-bodied reds. The researchers came to this conclusion after surveying a group of adults on food and beverage preferences, and their consumption patterns. The researchers say they were able to predict wine preferences based on the data gathered about their eating, drinking and other personal habits. According to Carl Borchgrevink, lead author of the study, customers should drink their favourite wines instead of those suggested by a sommelier. He added that it was the palate that rules and not someone else\u2019s idea of which wine we should drink with our food. The study was published in the International Journal of Wine Business Research.

VOne of the flood monitoring systems installed by IIT-M.  Chennai: . Dr. Balaji Narasimhan, Associate Professor, Environment and Water Resources Engineering Division, Dept of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras, said that flood monitoring sensors have been installed in six locations: Okkiam Maduvu (OMR), Maraimalai Adigal Bridge (Saidapet), Thiru Vi Ka Bridge (Adyar), Anna Nagar Bridge (near the Arch), Napier Bridge and Ennore creekBridge, above Ennore Creek. These are in the observational phase, where we are trying to understand that for a given amount of rainfall, what will be the discharge of water in the rivers and how much the water levels will rise. We are in the process of building, calibrating and validating a hydrological model. . Once developed, it can be used with the rainfall forecasrs to serve as a flood early warning system,\u201d said the professor. Agencies such as National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast the rainfall. \u201cWe can use the rainfall forecast data from these agencies and our model to find out how this quantity of forecasted rainfall will result in water flow to the rivers. We can ascertain how much of the downstream area will be flooded and to what extent. This can be done 24-48 hours in advance, giving state authorities the time to respond. These inputs can identify vulnerable areas and deploy appropriate resources in those areas\u201d said the professor. Funded by Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, IIT-M is working along with IIT-Bombay and Anna University to develop this system. \u201cAfter we find out the water flow pattern, we can integrate the data with topography, to ascertain if the flooding level of an area will be at 2-feet or 5-feet, in advance. This can help the state authority. The technology will be shared with the State Disaster Management Authority and we will train officials on interpreting and using the data,\u201d he said.

VFormer Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri remains in Saudi Arabia days after reports emerged alleging that the official had been forcibly held in the country. BEIRUT (Sputnik) \u2013 Lebanon\u2019s President Michel Aoun called on Riyadh to clarify the reasons preventing Prime Minister Hariri from returning to Lebanon to join his relatives, people, and supporters," according to the statement issued on Saturday. The Lebanon president\u2019s office also said that Aoun was waiting for Hariri to return to Lebanon and explain the circumstances of his resignation. Moreover, the president reportedly refused to accept Hariri\u2019s resignation from Riyadh. . Saad Hariri had announced resignation from the position of Lebanese Prime Minister in a video address from Riyadh on November 4. He was about to leave the kingdom and return to his home country. Hariri expressed fear that he could be assassinated like his father in Lebanon and accused Tehran and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement of attempts to destabilize the situation in his country, as well as across the Middle East. However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that Hariri's accusations against Tehran were groundless. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said that the Saudi Arabian government could have forced Hariri to resign. Hariri served as prime minister from 2009 to 2011 and took the office again in November 2016. His father, Rafik Hariri, was killed in 2005 as a result of an explosion in Beirut. A special tribunal in The Hague charged five members of Hezbollah in connection with the murder.

VHMD Global has started rolling out a new software update to Nokia 6 international edition, introducing the November 2017 Android security patch to the budget smartphone. The software package weighs 150MB, and other than a load of security fixes for the month of November, the update does not seem to include any other improvements to the handset. It is worth pointing out that Nokia 6 is among the devices to receive the November security patch first, in keeping with HMD Global\u2019s goal to deliver regular updates to the new brand of Nokia on a timely fashion. True to its word, HMD Global has been quick to release the latest Android security patch to Nokia 6, as Google launched the update only six days ago for the November 6, 2017 patch level, with the patch breakdown comprising November 1st, November 5th, and November 6th. Overall, the November 2017 security patch level includes 31 fixes: 9 fixes for the November 6th patch and 11 fixes for each of November 1st and 5th. With the November 1st and 5th patch levels, critical-level vulnerabilities in the native media services of Google\u2019s mobile operating system have been addressed, which could otherwise let attackers access any device remotely. Also, the security update fixes several other issues with the WLAN, GPU and camera drivers, with the patch being intended for Android 4.4 KitKat through to Android 8.0 Oreo. Nokia 6 received the update only a few days after HMD Global rolled out a similar security patch to Nokia 7 in China, introducing a bevy of security fixes, camera optimizations, facial recognition improvements, and other enhancements to the network performance and power saving features. Announced in January of this year, the Nokia 6 is made out of metal and features a 5.5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The device is powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core System-on-Chip (SoC), coupled with the Adreno 505 GPU for graphics requirements. Under the hood, it also packs either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of expandable native storage. On the optics aspect, the phone boasts a 16-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel camera that is placed on the phone\u2019s front side. Nokia 6 is juiced up by a non-removable 3,000mAh battery and runs stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, though the handset is also set to receive the Android 8.0 Oreo update before the end of the year.

V Baghdad, Nov 13 - An earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale hit has Iraq's Sulaimaniyah province, killing four persons and injuring 50 others, the media reported. .  The epicentre of the earthquake on Sunday was 32 km southwest of the Halabja area near the Iranian border at the depth of 33.9 km, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), Xinhua news agency reported.  The earthquake was felt in many Iraqi provinces in the north and central regions, including the Iraqi capital Baghdad, witnesses said.  Most casualties occurred in the town of Darbandikhan, around 35 km from the city of Sulaimaniyah.  The casualties in Darbandikhan could rise as some houses have collapsed and it is not clear yet whether there were people buried under the debris, Nasih Mala Hassan, Mayor of Darbandikhan, was quoted as saying.  Iraqi Minister of Water Resources warned the people down the Darbandikhan Dam to be in highest alert as the condition of the dam is not clear.  In Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, dozens of people were taken to hospitals. Some were treated from injuries and others fainted or shocked, said the online newsite.

VIconic scooter brand Lambretta is back with a bang! The Italian scooter manufacturer has made a comeback with three new products. Lambretta has unveiled its three new scooters, the V50 Special, V125 Special and V200 Special at the 2017 EICMA motorcycle show in Milan, Italy. Autocar India reports that the brand will make its India entry in 2019. Lambretta scooters were assembled in India between the 1950s to 1990s under the license of Automobile Products of India (API) and then Scooters India Limited (SIL). Lambretta vanished from the global market for two decades due to a financial crisis. Now, Lambretta is back with its new products which feature classic design elements and modern technology. The overall design of the new scooters resembles the classic scooters of the 1950s to 1990s. Lambretta has named the scooter as V Special, which indeed looks special. All the three models, the V50 Special, V125 Special and V200 Special gets two variants - with the fixed fender and flexed fender. The new range of scooters from Lambretta will be manufactured in Taiwan and will be retailed in Europe by early-2018. Out of the three models, the V50 Special is the smallest with a 49cc air-cooled engine producing 3.4bhp and 3.4Nm of torque. Powering the V125 Special is a 124.7cc fuel-injected engine producing 9.9bhp and 9.2Nm of torque. The top-of-the-range V200 Special draws power from a 168.9cc fuel injected engine producing 12bhp and 12.5Nm of torque. The CVT gearbox is common across all the three models. The Lambretta V Specials are loaded with features such as LED headlamp, taillamp and turn indicators, 220mm disc brake, telescopic forks, and a 12-volt charging socket. The top-spec V200 Special also gets Bosch ABS. DriveSpark Thinks!. The modern Lambretta scooter features a right blend of classic design and technology. The Italian company plans to enter the Indian market by 2019. The pricing will be a key factor for Lambretta to be successful in the country. The company is expected to enter the Indian market as an independent brand rather than collaborating with local firms.

VWashington, Nov 12 (PTI) Scientists have discovered fossil fragments of 260 million-year-old trees in Antarctica, a finding which shows that the frozen continent had a thriving forest before the first dinosaurs roamed the Earth. . During Antarcticas summer, scientists from University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (UWM) in the US climbed the McIntyre Promontorys frozen slopes in the Transantarctic Mountains. . They combed the mountains grey rocks for fossils from the continents green, forested past. . "People have known about the fossils in Antarctica since the 1910-12 Robert Falcon Scott expedition," said Erik Gulbranson, assistant professor at UWM. . "However, most of Antarctica is still unexplored. Sometimes, you might be the first person to ever climb a particular mountain," said Gulbranson. . The Permian Period ended 251 million years ago in historys greatest mass extinction, as the Earth rapidly shifted from icehouse to greenhouse conditions. . More than 90 per cent of species on Earth disappeared, including the polar forests. Researchers believe that the trees in the Antarctic forests were an extremely hearty species and is trying to determine why they went extinct. . Many scientists now believe that a massive increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, caused the Permian-Triassic extinction. . It is likely that over the course of 200,000 years, volcanic eruptions in Siberia released many tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. . John Isbell, professor at UWM, has previously studied Antarcticas Permian glacial deposits to determine how the climate changed. . On this expedition, he used the rocks around the fossilised trees to determine how the fossils fit into Antarcticas geologic history. . "This forest is a glimpse of life before the extinction, which can help us understand what caused the event," Gulbranson said. It can also give clues to how plants were different than today. . At the Permian Periods end, Antarctica was warmer and more humid than it is today. It was part of Gondwana, the supercontinent spanning the Southern Hemisphere that also included present-day South America, Africa, India, Australia and the Arabian Peninsula. . There would have been a mixture of mosses, ferns and an extinct plant called Glossopteris, and it is likely that this forest stretched across the entirety of Gondwana. . "This plant group must have been capable of surviving and thriving in a variety of environments," Gulbranson said. . However, not even these robust forests survived the high carbon dioxide concentrations of the mass extinction. . The resilient plants also must have survived through the polar extremes of perpetual light and total darkness. . Even in a warmer past, the polar regions would have experienced months of darkness in winter and would have gone without sunset during the summer months. PTI MHN MHN.

VA dad from Chicago took to Facebook and got tongues wagging about the practice of putting cereal in a baby's bottle. No matter what you post on the internet these days, you're opening yourself up to a bevy of judgment -- especially as a parent. So, it's no wonder that a dad named Tyrese Loyd is at the center of a fiery debate after taking to Facebook to share a photo of his baby's bottle, as prepared by his brother. Loyd appears to have asked his brother to put "2 scoops of cereal" in the LO's bottle. What he meant: Add infant rice cereal to the baby's formula or breast milk, an old-school trick that some believe helps babies sleep better. What his brother did: Add adult cereal!. "So I asked my lil brother to make the baby a bottle last night and put 2 scoops of cereal in it \U0001f621 \U0001f621 this the thanks I get for not doing it myself\u2639\ufe0f\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602," Loyd wrote alongside the image of a baby bottle filled with colorful cereal. . Commenters quickly swooped in to weigh in on the cereal trick. "It's not recommend anymore to put baby cereal in the baby bottle anymore," one wrote. "It is just empty calories there is no nutritional value. It will cause the baby to gain unnecessary weight." Others defended the practice, like one commenter who wrote, "I have put cereal in baby bottles for decades. It helps them sleep through the night because they have a full belly.". Since the photo was shared on November 5, it's racked up 7.6K comments and more than 53K shares. Wow. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics' experts, "A baby\u2019s digestive system is not thought to be well prepared to process cereal until about 6 months of age. ... What's more, putting cereal in the bottle is considered by some to be a form of force-feeding that can cause babies to 'overdose' on calories.". The silver lining of the controversy? Loyd's post served as something of a PSA on how parents might want to avoid this antiquated practice!.

V New Delhi : To study microgravity\u2019s effect on bacterial antibiotic resistance, scientists are set to send E. coli, a common bacterial pathogen linked to urinary tract infections and foodborne illnesses, to the International Space Station (ISS). The E. coli AntiMicrobial Satellite (EcAMSat) mission is scheduled to launch to the ISS on Orbital ATK\u2019s Cygnus cargo spacecraft on Saturday along with a slew of other science experiments and supplies for the Expedition 53 crew, Space.com reported. Antibiotic resistance could pose a danger to astronauts, especially since microgravity has been shown to weaken human immune response, NASA said. The E. coli AntiMicrobial Satellite mission will investigate spaceflight effects on bacterial antibiotic resistance and its genetic basis. The experiment will expose two strains of E. coli, one with a resistance gene, the other without, to three different doses of antibiotics, then examine the viability of each group. \u201cResults from this investigation could contribute to determining appropriate antibiotic dosages to protect astronaut health during long-duration human spaceflight and help us understand how antibiotic effectiveness may change as a function of stress on Earth,\u201d NASA said. Rather than being housed inside the space station, this experiment will take place in a 6U cubesat, a small satellite that has six times the volume of a single cubesat. The fundamental scenario of the experiment protocol will start four days after launch of the EcAMSat satellite by allowing an initial growth and then starvation period for E. coli bacteria contained in 48 microfluidic wells. The investigation aims to determine \u201cthe lowest dose of antibiotic needed to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterial pathogen that causes infections in humans and animals,\u201d NASA officials wrote in a description of the experiment.

VAmarawati: The use of electrical vehicles as part of its plans for mobility will soon be realised in the new formed state. In the 'Electric Mobility Stakeholder Meet' held, on Friday, by officials from different departments of the state government to discuss the development of a policy for electric mobility. The state has been planning to use electrical vehicles as part of its plans for mobility in the urban cities. Pic courtesy: twitter.com/@naralokesh. Officials from the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB), Department of Industries and Commerce, Department of Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, Department of Transport, Roads and Buildings and Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) attended the meeting.  The meet was chaired by Nara Lokesh, IT minister, and was led by APEDB.  \u201cSubsidies on electric vehicles is not enough to spruce the market and instead an interplay of demand creation, technology development, pilot projects and charging infrastructure is the way forward,\u201d Lokesh said. Pic courtesy: twitter.com/@naralokesh.  Solomon Arokiaraj, secretary of Department of Industries and Commerce, said, \u201cAlthough manufacturing would have an added thrust in the electric mobility policy, specific emphasis would be given to innovation, startups and disruptive technology.\u201d.  \u201cAndhra Pradesh has always believed in garnering consensus in policy making and this meet in Vijayawada is a testimony to this\u201d he added.  J Krishna Kishore, CEO, APEDB said that the meet determined the stakeholders' common agenda and path forward to build policies on tangible results. Apart from deliberating on the future of mobility, the meet would help define the route to a low-carbon economy by 2029.  Company representatives of the Mahindra Electric, Hyundai, Nissan, Renault, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, TVS Motors, Ola, Texas Instruments, ARM, Gayam Motors, Sun Mobility, Facor Group, Panasonic, Amara Raja, PLR Chambers and Goldman Sachs attended the meeting.  \u201cAn extensive network of swapping stations equipped to quickly 'refuel' EVs from multiple OEMs will go a long way in addressing lengthy charging times and range anxiety. To create a mutually supportive ecosystem that runs on an open architecture, it's important to have government and industry participation, to work together to standardize the interfaces,\u201d Chetan Maini, vice chairman, SUN Mobility remarked.

Sunderarajan Padmanabhan writes for India Science Wire. Shillong: Chennai, which of late has been experiencing flooding, is all set to get a comprehensive flood warning system being developed by several national agencies and institutions. The project is being implemented under the supervision of a high-power committee led by the former secretary of the ministry of earth sciences, Shailesh Nayak. The initiative was taken by the office of the principal scientific advisor after the devastating floods the city experienced in 2015. Speaking to India Science Wire here, Nayak said the work was progressing well and that the system is expected to go online by February next year. It would keep track of heavy rain events and produce forecasts accounting for multiple relevant parameters, such as tide heights in the Bay of Bengal and water levels in reservoirs feeding the city as well as in the Adyar and Cooum rivers that run through it. The institutions involved in this exercise include the India Meteorological Department, the National Central for Medium Range Weather Forecast, the Central Water Commission, the National Disaster Management Authority (national level) and the Tamil Nadu Government\u2019s Irrigation Department. As for the academic front: IITs Powai and Madras are designing and developing the system. It will be managed by the Chennai-based Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management (ICMAM) project under the ministry of earth sciences. \u201cInformation about rainfall, tides, reservoir and river levels and other parameters will flow from IMD and other agencies into ICMAM. It will analyse the data and disseminate the forecasts to NDMA, State Government and other stakeholders,\u201d Nayak said. .

VLess than the recommended 150 minutes a week still seemed to help, study found.  HealthDay Reporter . THURSDAY, Oct. 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- That evening stroll you take after dinner most nights may be doing you more good than you realize -- new research suggests even a bit of regular walking can reduce your risk of death. "Walking has been described as the 'perfect exercise' because it is simple, free, convenient, doesn't require any special equipment or training, and can be done at any age," said study leader Alpa Patel, a cancer epidemiologist from the American Cancer Society. "With the near doubling of adults aged 65 and older expected by 2030, clinicians should encourage patients to walk even if less than the recommended amount, especially as they age, for health and longevity," Patel said in a society news release. Previous research has linked regular walking with a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and breast and colon cancers. However, many American adults don't get the recommended levels of walking or other types of exercise. The recommended amounts are at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week. Continued. In this study, researchers examined data from nearly 140,000 American adults. Of those, 95 percent said they did some walking. Nearly half said walking was their only form of moderate-vigorous physical activity. The researchers adjusted the data to account for other factors that could affect the risk of death, such as smoking, obesity and chronic health problems. After those adjustments, the researchers concluded that people whose only exercise was walking less than two hours per week had a lower risk of death from any cause than those who did no physical activity. Those who did one to two times the minimum amount of recommended weekly exercise (2.5 to 5 hours) by only walking had a 20 percent lower risk of death. The risk of death was similar among those who exceeded activity recommendations through only walking. Walking was most strongly associated with reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases -- about a 35 percent lower risk for those who walked more than six hours a week than those who were least active. Continued. Walking was also associated with about 20 percent lower risk of death from heart disease. People who only walked also had a 9 percent lower risk of death from cancer, the study authors said. However, none of the results proved a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The study was only designed to show associations. The findings were published online Oct. 19 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

VA team of Chinese researchers has successfully conducted a data transmission via a quantum channel over a distance of almost 3 kilometers, a new record. Chinese scientists announced that they have made a major breakthrough in quantum communications, claiming to successfully transmit data via a quantum channel over a distance of 2.7 kilometers, according to a report by Defense One. If the claim is verified, it will mark a significant milestone in quantum communication methods \u2014 sending messages that cannot be intercepted or spied on. Quantum-encrypted data cannot be eavesdropped because a third party tampering with the communication channel causes a quantum message to change, and both the recipient and the sender will know that someone is attempting an intercept. Due to the nature of quantum physics, any observation using our large-scale instruments influences \u2014 and so alters \u2014 the object of observation, an effect known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Much like the 20th century space race, the US and China are rapidly developing quantum messaging technology, and China appears to be in the lead, for now. In June, Chinese scientists demonstrated their first secure quantum communication by means of a small-scale tabletop experiment. This time, they have pushed the boundaries by successfully sending and receiving sending quantum-based messages over much longer long distances. The Chinese research team claims that their system can be scaled to send messages "tens of kilometers." The US does not have those capabilities presently, according to Defense One. If quantum communication becomes the new norm it will alleviate the need for any form of encryption. While today's best encryption is nearly unbreakable, it is not 100-percent secure. Thus, developing quantum systems becomes a matter of national security. In 2015, scientists from US Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) teleported a photon over a 60-mile fiber-optic cable. "This is clearly a long way from a true communication medium, but it gets us closer to the possibility of quantum encryption," Extreme Tech wrote at the time. This year, Chinese scientists leapt ahead by claiming to have teleported quants a whopping 1200 kilometers distance, using a satellite. The latest experiment, if not the farthest, did, however, include full-scale communication, including a security test, information encoding, fiber transmission and decoding, according to the authors of the paper.

VThe UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) is introducing \u201cGP at Hand,\u201d a service which allows patients to have a consultation over video call. The NHS has teamed up with Babylon Health, a healthcare provider which enables users to have appointments through video calls or text, through its app. Anyone who is already registered with the NHS will be able to talk to a doctor within two hours, and doctors will be able to give them a prescription sent to their nearest pharmacy, or even arrange an appointment in person afterwards if they feel it necessary. The integration with Babylon Health comes as a sensible solution to Britain\u2019s healthcare delay. Most patients today will have to wait up to three weeks to get an appointment, as a result of a shortage of family doctors \u2014 now, they\u2019ll have a GP on their mobile phone, without the hassle and the wait. The service is only currently available in London, with hopes of expanding across the country. Video call consultations are the newest addition to the already existing AI-powered chatbot which the NHS started trialling earlier this year in the hopes to alleviate the same problem that it\u2019s having now. Of course, there could be dangers to giving out prescription medicine to anyone who claims to have certain symptoms. That\u2019s why the NHS says the service is less appropriate for those with the following conditions: women who are or may be pregnant, adults with a safeguarding need, people living with complex mental health condition and people with complex physical, psychological and social needs amongst others. There are also limitations, such as the fact that one needs a relatively powerful smartphone to access this benefit, not to mention a certain amount of tech know-how that some just don\u2019t have. The next step to improve the service could be by integrating wearable technology like FitBit. Doctors would be able to receive a more detailed panorama of the patient\u2019s body, such as heart rate, sleep and activity information all of which could be affecting your health. This way, it would be safer to give out prescription medicine to a patient, with a decreased risk of giving the wrong diagnosis.

V (CNN)When Vincent van Gogh was working on his series of olive trees paintings in 1889, he probably didn't realize a wayward grasshopper had taken up residence deep in the paint on one of his canvasses. . Maybe it just had good taste in art? . A painting curator at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City recently discovered the small critter, which had been peacefully resting, undetected, for 128 years. . Mary Schafer, a paintings conservator who was working to catalog the piece, spotted the grasshopper while looking at "Olive Trees" under magnification. To her, the finding wasn't unusual, the museum reports, since Van Gogh was known to paint outdoors. Experts at Nelson-Atkins cited an 1855 letter in which van Gogh wrote, "I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the 4 canvases that you'll be getting, not to mention dust and sand ..." . There is no clear explanation for how the grasshopper ended up on the canvas. A paleo-entomologist told the team there were no signs of movement in the paint, which could suggest that the bug, which was missing its abdomen and thorax, was dead before it got stuck, according to the museum. And while museum visitors might want to sneak a peek at the grasshopper, experts said it can't be seen through casual observation. .

VA Borneo clouded leopard. Wikipedia photo. A Bornean clouded leopard and her two cubs were captured on camera strolling through a Malaysian forest reserve last week, a rare daytime sighting of the elusive animals in the wild. Found only on the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the big cat species is known to zoologists as Neofelis diardi, with just 700 estimated to live in a habitat shrunk by poaching and deforestation. "Seeing it in daytime is nearly unheard of, and never with its young," said Michael Gordon, who filmed the animals cross a road and walk into a bush in Deramakot in Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo, where camera traps first spotted the cats in 2010. "The Sunda clouded leopard is difficult across most of its range, but the last 3 years I have been coming to Deramakot, I have seen it a quite a few times," the photographer told Reuters, using an alternative name for the species. The animal's habitat has shrunk by a tenth each year over the last two decades, the World Wildlife Fund said, hit by poaching and deforestation for commercial purposes. It feeds on monkeys, small deer, birds and lizards, and is the main predator on Borneo, an island shared by Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. In 2007, genetic studies showed the species to be distinct from its nearest relative, the clouded leopard, or Neofelis nebulosa, which was first described scientifically by British naturalist Edward Griffith in 1821, the WWF says. The range of the clouded leopard extends from Nepal on the Indian subcontinent to southern China and throughout South-East Asia. The island clouded leopard has small cloud markings, a double stripe down its back and its greyer fur is darker than the mainland species, the WWF says.

V Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha had been on leave abroad . Chief Justice of Bangladesh Surendra Kumar Sinha on Saturday resigned, six weeks after he went on a leave amid criticism over a Supreme Court verdict that scraped a vital constitutional amendment. Bangladesh President House Spokesman Joynal Abedin confirmed the receipt of Justice Sinha\u2019s resignation letter from abroad to the President, a day after his month-long leave ended on Friday. He led an appellate division bench of the Supreme Court, which scrapped the 16th amendment to the Constitution, stripping the Parliament\u2019s power to impeach apex court judges on grounds of incapacity and misconduct. Justice Sinha had earlier drawn criticism more for the \u201cobservations\u201d he made in the verdict than the judgment itself. Reports said Mr. Sinha left Singapore on Friday for Canada to see his ailing daughter. Ruling Awami League and many civil society leaders criticised Justice Sinha for his observations on Bangladesh politics, the Election Commission, governance and judiciary. They also accused him of \u201cbelittling\u201d the Father of the Nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in his observations. Rare statement. Immediate reasons behind Justice Sinha\u2019s resignation could not be ascertained. In a rare statement issued by Justice Sinha on October 13, the day he left the country , he said he was \u201cnot sick\u201d and the criticism over the verdict \u201cembarrassed\u201d him. According to a Supreme Court statement, Justice Sinha faces 11 charges, including corruption, money laundering and moral lapse, for which his colleagues in the appellate division refused to work with him.

VWe have seen many camouflaged test mules of the facelifted Mahindra Scorpio earlier. However, the one spotted this time clearly reveals the changes the SUV gets as a part of its mid-life cycle refresh. The overall design of the Mahindra Scorpio remains the same. It's the seven-slat front grille which is redesigned with a dual-tone treatment. These are some minor tweaks to the front bumper and headlights too. Also, the fog lamps get chrome surrounds, a front scuff plate and even clear lens indicators. The OVRMs get integrated LED turn indicators, while the vehicle rides on a new pattern of five-spoke alloy wheels. The black applique will get toned down and sport a traditional chrome garnish above the registration plate. Though these images do not point at the changes in the cabin, we are expecting some changes to the interior too. The dash will get the same layout but now feature an updated infotainment system. This might be carried over from the updated XUV500 whose unit gets a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and many other apps. It is rumoured that there will be a new S11 variant which will get front facing seats in the third row. There are no confirmations on the changes to the powertrain and we expect the same engine options to be retained. Mahindra might launch this refreshed Scorpio on 14 November, when the variant-wise prices will also be announced then. Stay tuned.

LONDON: China, which on its way to emerge as a Space Superpower, claims be the first nation to make contact with alien life using the world\u2019s largest radio dish. According to researchers, the dish, which is 500-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope is about twice the size of the US\u2019 Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, can detect signals from the deepest depths of space. In 2016, China became a space exploration powerhouse after it fired its brand new lab Tiangong 2 into low orbit \u2013 joining the US and Russia. China made the move following numerous dozens of suspected-extraterrestrial encounters, including the claims that a UFO was seen over the Great Wall of China last week, reports Daily Star Online. According to reports, China has spent billions of pounds into space exploration and the world\u2019s largest dish to detect alien signals coming from other galaxies. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the bold project would enable them to take larger and further steps in space exploration and make new contributions to building up China as a space power. A researcher Liu Cixin described the dish as something \u201cout of science fiction.\u201d Liu has written many books about the risks of first contact and warns that the \u201cappearance of this \u2018other\u2019\u201d could end with mankind\u2019s extinction.

VHit every muscle group in this quick workout. When you're short on time, a quick-hit workout that targets nearly every muscle group in your body is exactly what you need. This short routine from George Foreman III, a professional boxer and co-founder of boxing gym Everybody Fights in New York City, will blast your entire body in less than 10 minutes. To get started, grab a set of two-pound weights and find a line or a rope to duck under at chest height. Begin by standing on one side of the line with your knees bent and your weights up by your chin. Step to the right under the line with your right foot and punch your right arm forward. Then step to the left under the line and throw a left hook. Each time you throw a punch or a hook, snap your arm back toward your body quicker than the outward movement. When you duck underneath the line, remember: "It's a squat, don't bend over with your back. That's a great way to get hurt," Foreman says. Take your time for one-minute, step to the right and shoot your right punch, then step to the left and shoot your left hook. Repeat that for one minute straight, then do 30 air squats and repeat that cycle six times. That should equal two 3-minute rounds in the boxing ring. After a tough full-body workout like this one, treat your body to some much-needed stretching. These 16 stretches will soothe your muscles and help improve your flexibility.
