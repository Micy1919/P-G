VYou always see your crush on MSN, but are afraid to start chatting. You're worried that you won't say the right thing or will run out of things to talk about. Don't worry so much--flirting with your crush on MSN should be fun and stress-free! If you fine-tune your flirting techniques, you can make your crush smile, laugh, and want to see you in person in no time.\u000a Method One of Six:\u000aHooking Your Crush From the StartEdit \u000a Don't chat your crush the second he or she signs online.  Your heart may race the second your crush signs on, but that doesn't mean you have to race to start your conversation. It's better to play it cool and look like you're not just hanging around waiting for the second he or she signs on.  \u000aUnless your crush is the kind of person who only signs on for a minute at a time, let some time pass--at least 10 or 15 minutes. Then your crush will see that while you want to continue your conversation, you have other things to do on MSN. This will make you look less needy or clingy.\u000aDon't wait too long or your crush won't think you're interested.\u000a Have a fun and casual opening.  When you do greet your crush, it's important to start the conversation on the right foot so your crush wants to spend more time talking to you. The key here is to play it cool---but not too cool.  \u000aSaying, "How are you?" or "What's up?" is perfectly acceptable. Don't try too hard to wow your crush with your opener.\u000aYou can start with an interesting story about something that happened to you, something you were previously talking about, or something cool you just heard on the news. Again, keep it short and don't try too hard.\u000a Avoid always being the one who says "hi" first.  It's important to strike a balance in your relationship. You don't want to be the one who always sends the first message, because there might be a chance that your crush may not be all that eager to talk to you after all.  \u000aIt may be the case that your crush is just shy and likes it when you make all the moves. But if this is the case, then it could be a sign that if you take your relationship to the next level, your crush will still expect you to do all the work. That could get annoying really fast.\u000a Method Two of Six:\u000aBeing PlayfulEdit \u000a Tease your crush.  Once you get to know each other a little better, teasing will be a great way to flirt with your crush. This will show that you appreciate your crush's quirks and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some great ways to tease your crush:  \u000aIf he's really obsessed with a particular hobby, band, or activity, you can poke fun at him about that. If he's obsessed with his guitar, for example, you can say, "How much time did you spend with your girlfriend today?"\u000aIf you like sports teams who are rivals, you can tease him about how his team is going to lose that day without being too annoying about it.\u000aDon't take your teasing too far. There's a difference between poking fun at someone and insulting him or her, and it can be hard to tell the difference on the Internet.\u000aShow that you can be teased, too. He'll be impressed that you're confident enough for him to make fun of your foibles too.\u000a Be witty.  Your crush will be impressed by your quick wit and sense of humor. It can be tricky to show your scintillating sense of humor online, but if you can pull it off, your crush will be impressed. Here are some ways to wow your crush with your wit:  \u000aBe quick. If your crush says something clever, say something back as quickly as you can to show that you can play ball.\u000aBe clever. Make a joke about a subject he knows a lot about to show that you're well-read and understand what's going on in the world.\u000aBe sarcastic. A little bit of sarcasm can go a long way. If you're having a hard time in biology class, you can pretend to gush about how much you love dissecting frogs. Your crush will be charmed by you if you set the right tone.\u000a Method Three of Six:\u000aBeing FascinatingEdit \u000a Bring up interesting topics.  To keep your crush engaged, you'll have to find topics that are worth talking about. Make sure you find something that is not only interesting to you. Here are some ideas:  \u000aIf something particularly exciting is happening in the news, you could bring it up, especially if it just happened. You could say, "Did you hear about...?" Make sure you don't pick anything too controversial, such as gun control, because you don't want to start an argument before you really know your crush.\u000aIf something out of the ordinary happened to you that day, tell your crush. If you ran into a celebrity, saw something crazy happen on the street, or got some big news, it could be worth talking about.\u000aNothing will bore your crush faster than telling him or her about everything that happened to you that day. Unless you're a secret agent or a superhero, chances are that most of your day is pretty mundane, and you don't want to look like a narcissist by talking about what you had for breakfast like it's the most fascinating topic in the world.\u000a Find a common bond.  If you're looking to take your relationship beyond flirting, remember that common interests can be just as important as chemistry in a strong relationship. Your love is guaranteed to last longer if you share passions other than your passions for each other. Here are some things you may have in common:  \u000a Music can be a great bond between two people, so try to strike up a conversation about music. If your crush has his or her 'What I'm Listening To' message working, look at the song he or she is listening to and say something like, "Oh, I love that band!" If the band is having a concert, you and your crush may even end up going together.\u000aYour love for the outdoors. If both of you love hiking, biking, or camping, that can be a great bond. The outdoors are not for everyone, and your crush will respect you if you share that love--and may even ask you to tag along on a hiking adventure.\u000aYour love for literature. If you both love good books, this will give you a lot to talk about. You can even impress him by recommending a great read, or reading a book he mentions. If the conversation is going well, you can even say, "Hey, I loved that book your recommended. Want to talk about it over coffee some time?"\u000aYour love for good movies. If you're both into the movies, you will have plenty to talk about. You can casually mention a new film you're excited to see and can wait for your crush to ask you to come along.\u000a Show that you have a life outside of MSN.  Make your crush see that you have a life outside of your computer. Mention your friends, your family, and definitely your interests, to show that your chat-life is just one small part of your fascinating personality. Here is how to show that your world is bigger than your chat screen:  \u000aWithout being boring, tell talk about your favorite hobby. If you love to go biking, tell your crush about it. Mention when you have to go because you're going to pursue your hobby.\u000aMention your favorite friends, and say when you have to go because you and your friends are going out to dinner, to a concert, or wherever. This will make you seem like a fun person, and he may even want to join.\u000aIf you're passionate about your studies or a certain subject in school, don't be afraid to say so. Without looking like a nerd, you can show him that you really care about something--poetry or physics, for example. Remember that interesting people have interests, while boring people are bored by everything.\u000a Method Four of Six:\u000aShowing That You're InterestedEdit \u000a Subtly compliment your crush.  Find ways to tell your crush what you really appreciate about him or her. This will show that you're paying attention to what makes your crush special and that you're a thoughtful person. Here are some ways to do it:  \u000aBe casual. Say, "You're so smart--I didn't know that," or "How interesting, I never would have thought of it that way!" This shows that you appreciate your crush's insight without fawning all over him or her.\u000aFind what makes your crush special. If your crush loves running marathons, say, "It's so impressive that you could do that."\u000aPraise your crush's achievements. Say something simple like, "I can't believe you published a poem. That must have taken a lot of work!"\u000a Take your crush's advice.  Show your crush that you're actually listening to the things he or she says. This will demonstrate that you value your crush's opinion and that you're thinking about him or her even when you step away from the computer. Here's how to do it:  \u000aIf your crush recommends an album, listen to it. This will give you something to talk about too.\u000aIf your crush recommends you buy a certain type of phone, pair of shoes, or whatever, if you think his or her advice is sound, take it. Then you can thank your crush for the tip.\u000aHowever, don't rush off to do whatever your crush says. If he recommends a movie, don't watch it instantly and report back the next day. Take a week or two to say, "Hey, I watched that movie you recommended, and it was amazing."\u000a Show an interest in your crush's life.  You should show that not only are you an interesting person, but that you care about your crush as a person. Try to strike a balance between talking about yourself, your common interests, and your crush. Here are some ways to do this:  \u000aAsk your crush how his or her week is going. This will get your crush to reveal some information what's going on in his or her life.\u000aIf your crush told you he or she went to a concert, tennis match, or restaurant, ask how it was.\u000aAsk your crush his or her opinion on a certain topic. This will show that you value what he or she has to say.\u000aDon't pry. You can casually ask about his or her interests, friends, or even family, but don't ask so many questions that you're getting too personal or sound like you're leading an interview.\u000a Ask your crush to hang out.  If things are going well and you feel that the timing is right, don't be afraid to invite your crush to take your relationship beyond MSN. If you've gotten to know your crush, you can do this casually and not make a big deal about it. Here's how:  \u000aAsk your crush what he or she has going on that weekend. If your crush says he's pretty free, suggest a casual hang out. Say, "Cool, me too--want to grab lunch?"\u000aIf your crush's favorite band or comedian is coming to town, ask if he wants to go to a show together.\u000aIf you're throwing a party or going out with a big group of friends, invite your crush. This will be a very low-pressure hang out, and will give you a feel for each other before you go on a real date.\u000a Method Five of Six:\u000aPlaying it CoolEdit \u000a Don't be too eager to talk to your crush.  To play it cool, you have to show that while you enjoy talking to your crush, your life does not revolve around him or her. Here are some ways to make this clear;  \u000aDon't talk to your crush every single time you sign online. Talk to him or her every second or third time you sign on. This will show that you're not only going online to continue your conversation.\u000aDon't respond to everything he or she says too quickly. If you respond the second he or she asks you a question, this will make it look like you're obsessed with your conversation. If you don't answer right away, your crush will see that you're talking to other people, or doing other things too.\u000a Don't underestimate the secret screen name.  Get a secret screen name that no one knows about to see what your crush is doing when he thinks you're not online. This can help you have a better sense of what your crush really thinks about you, and can help you cool it during your interactions.  \u000aIf you see that your crush isn't online much when he doesn't think you're online, this can suggest that he's online for the same reason you are--to continue flirting!\u000aIf you see that your crush is just always online, it may mean that he'll talk to whoever--whenever. This may also suggest that he doesn't have a life.\u000aLog on to your secret screen name after you say goodbye to your crush. Does your crush sign off right away? This may show that he's only sticking around to talk to you.\u000a Don't be too enthusiastic during your conversation.  It's great to show that you think your crush is an engaging, exciting, and fun person, but if you overdo it, you may end up looking too obsessive. Here are some things to avoid:  \u000aMinimize your use of "LOL" or "hahaha"--this will make it look like you're trying too hard to be funny.\u000aAvoid too many emoticons. This can get annoying and will make you look immature.\u000aIf your crush doesn't respond right away, don't immediately follow up with a series of question marks or say, "Where did you go???" This will make it look like your world revolves around your crush's answers.\u000a Method Six of Six:\u000aFinishing StrongEdit \u000a Sign off while things are still interesting.  It's important to sign off at the right time so you leave your special someone wanting more. You shouldn't leave too soon, but should say goodbye while things are still interesting. Here's how to do it:  \u000aWait for an interesting conversation to start wrapping up, and say you have to go. That way you can say one or two more things about the topic and then say goodbye. This will leave your crush wanting to talk to you more, and will help you avoid that long awkward pause that may happen after an hour of chatting when both of you are running out of things to say.\u000a Give a compelling reason for signing off.  If you want to play it cool, you shouldn't be too obvious about why you're leaving and make your crush think you are interesting and mysterious. Here's how to do it:  \u000aCasually say, "I'm going out now," so your crush wonders where you're going and who you're going with. Leave it ambiguous. This will also make it sound like you have lots of friends and an active social life.\u000aEven if you have no reason to go, don't say so. Don't say, "Well, I guess I better stop chatting so much," or "Gotta go water my plants." This will make it sound like you have nothing exciting going on in your life.\u000a Show that you had a great time talking to your crush.  You don't have to be obvious about it, but you can let your crush know that you had fun chatting and that you're looking forward to talking again. Here's what you should say:  \u000a"It's been fun talking to you" or "thanks for the advice about..." Let him know that the conversation was meaningful without overdoing it.\u000a"I'll talk to you soon." This will show that you are excited to talk to him again, but that you won't spend hours waiting around to see his screen name pop up again.\u000aDon't be creepy. Avoid saying things like, "That was the best conversation I've had in my entire life" or "What time will you be on MSN again so we can chat more???"\u000aBe relaxed in the way you talk to them. Don't reply to them instantly; it makes you seem too keen.\u000aIf your crush does not talk back straight away, do not nudge him. He may just be away from his computer.\u000aDon't talk to your crush every single day. You'll end up not having much to talk about, and it may look like you don't have a life.\u000aMost importantly, just be yourself. Don't try too hard; don't even try too hard to not try too hard. After all, do you want them falling in love with someone who isn't even the real you?\u000aTry not to ask them a question every second. It looks like you're obsessed.\u000aMost importantly don't be mean because that could set off a bad vibe.\u000aPraise your crush for the things she likes the most but don't act too much exited.\u000aIf you're meeting up with a person you've only met online, make sure to do it in a public place, like a park or a coffee shop. This way, you can make sure he's not a creep. Don't meet at his apartment or another place where you can't get immediate help if something goes wrong.\u000aIf you know your crush outside of the Internet, then these tips will work best. If it's a person you online know online but are developing a crush on, make sure he is who he says he is before you reveal personal information like your phone number and address.\u000aYou may be falling in love with your crush online, and can be very disappointed when you actually meet. He may have a charming online persona but could be a real dud in person--it happens all the time.\u000a Things You'll NeedEdit \u000a An MSN account\u000a A computer or a phone\u000a Your crush's MSN\u000a The Internet\u000a

VProfessor Iyorwuese Hagher, former Nigerian Ambassador to Mexico and Canada, has alleged that Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, MACBAN, has a trans-border Army and President Muhammadu Buhari is aware of it.\u000aThe former Nigerian Ambassador, who hails from Benue State alleged that the body hired this trans-border Army to attack Nigerians.\u000aHagher, who predicted the renewed Fulani attacks, made the allegations during an interview with Mercy Abang, a social media expert.\u000aAccording to Hagher, \u201cThe Miyetti Allah have an army. Whether they hire it out of people that are trans-border. I call them trans-border army and they hire them. They are all over West Africa and anytime they are hired, there is a form of complicity at the border.\u000a\u201cThere must be complicity for them to entering Nigeria\u2019s border at will. The borders are porous, there is no question about it but there must be complicity because the President and the Security agents know.\u201d\u000aHe also berated the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Ibrahim Idris for referring to the genocidal attack as a communal clash and called it a diversionary tactic.\u000aRecall that the former Ambassador also disclosed that the arms being used by the Fulani fighters were coming from the Nigerian armoury.\u000aIn a interview with Daily Sun, the former envoy also said having studied the situation so far, he was alarmed to discover that Buhari was one of the grand patrons of the herdsmen.\u000a

VHmm, Stephanie Otobo the lady who accused Apostle Suleman of having a sexual relationship with her has made a shocking u-turn saying, she was actually paid by some politicians to blackmail him. Recall, Stephanie had explained how the Apostle usually sent her money from Nigeria and even publicly said the police can talk to the bank to see her transactions and even said she can fully describe the Pastor's prick and also munched some of their video calls!! Now Stephanie says they are all lies and she was used against the Apostle. She visited his church yesterday in Edo State and made those confessions and also asked the Apostle and his wife to forgive her. The Apostle's wife, Lizzy later told her she has been forgiven and prayed for her. Let us just leave this things like this. Bcus truly, Stephanie said some things that are way beyond this sudden change...Except people like Sahara Reporters want to dig more and ofcus the likes of daddy freeze. Who is deceiving who? The video after the cut. \u000a

V Anshika Singh \u000a studied at Kendriya Vidyalaya IIT Powai \u000a24w ago\u000aDifferent people, different theories, different belief. I have my own.\u000aThis is going to be long.\u000aI) It is 100% the truth that, till the date Messi is a part of Barcelona or the football world, Neymar can never have his name as the "FIRST". I m not saying he was playing in Messi's Shadow but somewhere or the other everyone knows that Messi > Neymar no matter what the latter does.\u000aIt is highly likely that he wanted a name of his own and he saw no improvement ahead for him at FC Barcelona and decided to leave.\u000aII) U can't rule out the fact / rumour constituting money when you see the amount involved.\u000aPaul Pogba transfer amount : 89 million (second highest in history)\u000aNeymar Jr transfer amount : 222 million\u000a(HIGHEST EVER)\u000aNote the difference??????? Just between the first and second rank?!\u000aOne reason everyone thought that whatsoever happens Neymar won't leave this season was that, the buyout clause amount. 222m is a HUGE amount!!! But PSG being a filthy rich club, this wasn't a hurdle for them.\u000aAnyway this is what Neymar will be earning now... *Looks hypothetical isn't it?*\u000aWell yeah, the above amount is excluding what his dad will be earning or shall I say, GETTING from Paris Saint Germain! If indeed money is the reason then this is the shittest thing about this transfer. "Third best footballer of the world leaving a legendary club, titles to earn more money!" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.\u000aIf this reason is anyhow proved right, then I will that day lose all respect for him. :(\u000aIII) Neymar posted a heartfelt message on instagram to all those who were seeking answer or reason from him for his actions. ( On 03rd August 2017)\u000aThe reason he mentioned was "Wanting to Take Up More Challenges".\u000aIf I go on to explain the reason that he gave ( which in no way I want to do because it's highly evident that it is an utter while lie with no head or toe and that it is just a cover up for the silence that he maintained throughout, hurting all the Barca fans)\u000aBut still continuing...\u000aFrench League, Spanish La Liga.\u000aPSG have been dominating Ligue 1 for a very very long time. It was just last year that Monaco won. So there is no way PSG needed Neymar's help to win that. Also please note the fact the French Ligue sucks when it comes to competition.\u000aOn the other hand, there is more fun and challenging competition when it comes to La Liga in the form of El Clasico, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.\u000aAnd that, winning a La Liga trophy is definitely more fruitful than winning a Ligue 1 trophy.\u000a*Point rubbished off Neymar Jr *\u000aComing to UCL.\u000aThere is no way I feel Barca is dominating UCL. Yes PSG have never won it but Barca is no way ruling it either. Probably he wanted to win PSG a CL trophy and not FCB.\u000a*Point taken Neymar Jr *\u000aAre we even gonna talk about the King's Cup? :|\u000aIV) Not even in my wildest dreams I want to accept the following point. But after realising what's in this pic, I can't rubbish it off either :( :( :(\u000aThe pic is authentic. On the official youtube page of FCB u can find that video with that exact statement.\u000aIt is reportedly said that after Neymar single handedly outclassed the entire Paris saint germain team with his game play and mental belief the above pic of Lionel Messi stood out once again and was on the front page of famous Spanish newspaper "Sports". It is said that, that is exactly when Neymar decided to stand up for himself and took a firm decision because he knew Spanish people, Spanish league and Spain can never have look above Messi.\u000aProbably this gave a call to Neymar that he cannot take over Messi ever and that is when he decided to leave to have a name of his own.\u000aI dunno what the famous Spanish newspaper SPORTS published, but I bet, the social media was entirely taken over by NEYMAR NEYMAR AND ONLY NEYMAR after the second leg win against Paris Saint Germain..\u000aBut I m sure no barca fan will ever ever ever accept this, because they know what Messi and Neymar shared and that there was no room for insecurity.\u000aBecause NeyMessi or Neyssi is indeed FOR REAL.\u000aScreenshot of Neymar's insta post especially for MSN.\u000aRonaldinho mentored Messi, Messi mentored Neymar. Have u ever seen more beautiful spirit of sportsmanship? Not to forget how massively great these three players are individually.\u000aNevertheless I just cannot ignore this reason. *SIGH*\u000aBut if this was indeed the reason behind , then I wonder where football 's future is heading.\u000aThe transfer saga has come to an end...\u000aMSN has come to an end...\u000aMy dreams of watching MSN play an El Clasico live in Camp Nou has come to an end.\u000aWhat was bad about this transfer isn't that FCB lost their second best irreplaceable player, what was bad and hurtful was all about the way he left... He left hurting every single Cle every single Spanish person and leaving all NEYMARZETES hurt and ashamed. Because we as his fans cannot see all the hate comment coming his way but as a Barca fan, can't even stop cursing him for what he did to the biggest trio of the world!\u000aAs a Neymarzete, I so wish u don't regret ur decision in near future ever Neymar Jr. <3\u000aAs a Barca fan... I still have nothing to say :(\u000aLastly, I have listed down the possibilities with proof and it's now ur decision which one u wanna believe upon.\u000aThanks for Reading and sorry for the long answer :p\u000aImage source : Instagram\u000a Juan Tobar \u000a Played soccer my entire life \u000a24w ago\u000aIve read the other answers, even the long one (thanks Anshika). While they do make sense, like with everything in life, there's no black and white answer to this. Why he left? There's a few I believe are his reasons.\u000aMuch like in Brazil, in my native Ecuador, ftbol is huge. So big most kids can't even tell you when they started playing. Because it was probably before we could remember. Anyway, I had always been a pretty good player. But but by no means was I the best. There was this kid Eric. He was hands down the best player we had in my school, he was our captain and therefore the most popular kid in school. He was well known, liked and respected. And I was always envious. I wanted to be him. Now imagine little me is Neymar, my school team is FB Barcelona, and Eric is Messi. Neymar wants to be number one, he is envious. He has the skill for it, but he knows he won't be at Barcelona because of Messi. So he's leaving for somewhere where he can be #1.\u000aNeymar has won a lot at Barcelona. But is it really that hard to win things at Barcelona? It's arguably the #1 team in the world as far as quality goes currently, the only other contender would be fellow La Liga rivals Real Madrid. Would you rather be a really good player in a club surrounded with other really good players that are used to winning all the time? Or would you rather be a really good player at a decent team who aren't used to winning all the time? I think I would pick the latter. If I'm the quality player than Neymar is, then I can really make a difference in a team that's not always winning. And I'll be a hero. And I'll remembered forever. I'll leave a mark. At Barcelona he'll just be another super star like many that the club has had and with Messi in the mix it's unlikely he'll be able to really leave a mark in the history books for Barcelona.\u000aNow reasons 1 and 2 justify him leaving but they don't quite justify him leaving for PSG. PSG is a pretty big club already. They win things often because the French league is hardly competitive and with him on they will probably have a shot at the Champions League. He can certainly be number one but it's hardly a competition. Look at Ibrahimovic. He was there and he got bored. So he left. Did he leave a mark? Yes but PSG was already pretty successful club before him. So why PSG???? MONEY! Have you seen the amount of money they are paying for him??!? He\u2019ll be the best paid ftbol player in the world! Something like $1 million per week. Most people don't see that kind of money in their entire lives! He'll be the most expensive transfer in history (by a long shot). He\u2019ll be filthy rich, his family will be filthy rich, his agent will be filthy rich. Everyone wins\u000aIf Neymar really wanted a new challenges he would've chosen a team in a more competitive league think premier league. Or a smaller team in which he could've been the one to take them to the top. But he chose PSG. Why? Because they have the money and he wanted to leave so why not leave for a team that's going to pay you what you want and then some. I know I would.\u000a Chad Turner \u000a25w ago\u000aIn my opinion the main reason he left Barcelona is because he doesn't want to play second fiddle to Lionel Messi.\u000aSomething similar happened to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which let Zlatan to having certain disputes with Pep Guardiola (the Barcelona manager at the time), ultimately leading to his Barca exit. Zlatan wasn't being utilised properly and AGAIN the main reason for this was because of Lionel Messi. It has been said many times by former Barcelona players that when you step into the Barcelona dressing room no matter how good you are, you'll always be below Messi, always second fiddle to Messi.\u000aTo conclude by joining PSG Neymar will be the main man. He will be their highest paid player, their main striker, will get image rights and he'll be the Lionel Messi of PSG.\u000a Jack Walter \u000a25w ago\u000aMany say that it is about money but it\u2019s not. Neymar was always considered 2nd to Messi. He never got the respect that he deserved. Fan pages always appreciated Messi\u2019s performance, even if he did nothing in the game. And Neymar\u2019s performances were always ignored. Every player wants a part of the limelight for himself, and Neymar\u2019s no less.\u000a Axle Blaze \u000a lives in FC Barcelona \u000a1w ago\u000aThere were two main reasons for it -\u000aMoney (222 million euros) : neymar has become worlds most expensive football player of all time .\u000aHe wanted to be the main man of his team . But under messi\u2019s shadow it was not being possible. Hence , he moved to psg . He is proving his metal at psg . He has single handedly outclassed psg entire team with his skills . If you do not believe watch this video. Neymar - the saviour of psg. Plz guyz i have worked very very hard on this video . Plz watch it . I hope you will surely like it .\u000a

V John Chesire \u000a Former US Navy Fighter Pilot \u000a162w ago\u000aFirstly, there has been a long and glaring need for the U.S. to have and operate Light Air Support (LAS) aircraft such as the Super Tacano. Obviously the Air Force\u2019s strategic bombers and extraordinarily expensive F-22 and F-35 do not fulfill the need for LAS aircraft. Furthermore while the A-10 was far better suited to needs in Afghanistan and against ISIS, it was prematurely retired. [Although the A-10 may be getting new life as the Indiana Air National Guard may be heading to the Middle East.]\u000aPrior to the final selection, there had been some bitter competition between the Embraer A-29 Super Tucano and the Beechcraft AT-6C. Both aircraft are similar in capability, but differ in many small ways. Why the Super Tacano was selected instead of the AT-6, and whether that was the correct decision depends upon whom you talk to. Indeed Beechcraft is protesting the decision. My guess is The Super Tacano having more actual combat experience than the prototype AT-6C might have been the deciding factor. Of course there were probably many other factors involved too, rightly or wrongly.\u000aGraphics from Embraer: http://maquina-de-combate.com/bl...\u000a Tim Hibbetts \u000a Naval Aviator, Airline Pilot, Aerospace Eng Maj \u000a162w ago\u000aLarge acquisitions are about politics and economics.\u000aPolitics incorporates capability perceptions, domestic and foreign impact, and the speed and direction of the current wind.\u000aAs long as the contenders are in the same class, capability is not a real factor. No congressman is going to be caught buying a knife for a gunfight.\u000aFunneling money to supporters is the largest driver. Does one of our foreign partners need a boost? Is there someone on one of my committees that needs something for his district? As long as we can build or supply part of the product, we can justify getting it elsewhere. And that's not necessarily a bad thing\u2014it's not always better to buy domestically. Sometimes, we just don't have the best solution.\u000aThe vagaries of politics are difficult to follow and do not always leave obvious threads. Sometimes there are pre-arranged deals or forgotten promises.\u000aEconomics takes into account reported cost, development lines, follow-on costs, and regional impact.\u000aThe costs reported on the news sites has to be similar, so that is not a major issue.\u000aIf it's going to take a long time to develop, costs are going to rise\u2014that's a simple rule of acquisition. Going to the rack is always cheaper than going to the tailor.\u000aIf you can't point to a concrete cost of ownership over a few years, your projected costs are also going to be higher than estimates. Another rule of acquisition.\u000aWhich district needs the influx of jobs and tax money? This one balances between political and economics.\u000a Dan Birchall \u000a euthymic catarrhine \u000a162w ago\u000a A few points that might have had something to do with it.\u000aBeechcraft (Hawker Beechcraft, at the time) was going through serious financial hard times after the recession - in fact, it went through bankruptcy in 2012-2013, and stopped making private jets. There were major doubts in the industry about whether it'd survive, let alone be able to deliver large orders.\u000aAny effort to portray the competing T-6 as more "American" than the Super Tucano inevitably led to someone pointing out that the T-6 is derived from the Pilatus PC-9, with royalties going to the Swiss for every one sold. Oh, and that the Hawker part of "Hawker Beechcraft" wasn't very American in origin, either.\u000aThe US Air Force and Navy had already bought more than 500 T-6 trainers back in the 1990s, and the program wound up being "cited for Congressional notification" for 25\u201350% cost overrun over initial estimates. Once bitten, twice shy?\u000aBlackwater/XE had already been leasing at least one Super Tucano doing shady stuff for Navy special ops for a few years, so it wasn't exactly an unknown platform inside the defense community.\u000a Adam Petten \u000a Agricultural labor and sales. ESL(97-98) (2007-present) \u000a23w ago\u000aIt's versatility. It can outfly attack helicopters and the slow civilian planes with guns attached that the terrorists have access to. Its also much faster and better climbing than the Aeromacchi light fighter seen in Quantum of Solace.\u000aIf they designed a fighter with a 4500 bhp supercharged Engine with a 45000 foot ceiling larger payload with a 6000 foot a minute climb. and 550 mph top speed it'd probably cost 12\u201315 million each and would be overkill. It still would struggle against older jet fighters as their normal speed would be 600 mph with 8\u201310 000 foot a minute climb. Also their short bursts of 900 mph plus speed would be difficult to deal with.\u000aAn A10 prop plane equivalent would seem more than possible. With a couple of 4000+ bhp engines it could be armoured, 20000 pounds dry with a 12000 pound payload and as fast as an A10 with less fuel consumption and heat signature. The Osprey Engines or state of the art supercharged engines with better throttle response could be employed.\u000a

Furthermore while the A-10 was far better suited to needs in Afghanistan and against ISIS, it was prematurely retired. Although the A-10 may be getting new life as the Indiana Air Nation

VDepression is real! When we have friends going through depression, we naturally want to help and offer our idea of a quick fix or solution to the problem. As much as you are trying to help, some phrases often do more harm than good.\u000aI know how you feel. Be careful in the use of this phrase, unless you do have a personal experience with depression. If otherwise, this phrase makes the conversation basically all about you and invalidates what they are really going through.\u000aQuit whining, suck it up and cheer up. Hold up a second before saying this. Depression is not just some bad mood you get over easily but a mental illness. Instead of this, a listening ear would do wonders.\u000aLife sucks and people have it worse than you. You do not want to say this as feelings of guilt which are already existent can be worsened. Depression can affect anyone. Of course, I agree that people have it worse but it does not reduce the person\u2019s depression or make the pain any less real. \u000aAt the end of the day, your words are not the most supportive but your actions and showing you are there for the person not just for the now but in the long run.\u000a

VA break up is a very terrible thing to go through, especially if you really loved him. Also, people handle emotional issues differently. I understand these two things but doing any of the following 6 things is just a slight on your personality. \u000a1. Fight/ create scenes\u000aIt is normal that an emotion that quickly bubbles to the surface after breaking up is anger but don\u2019t let that push you into exchanging words with him or trying to hurt him physically.\u000a2. Cuss him out publicly\u000aYou may feel so betrayed that letting everyone else know how much of a douchebag he is seems right. Even if he treated you badly, you shouldn\u2019t go on social media and cuss him out or organize a \u2018thrash him\u2019 party with your friends. That\u2019s immature. \u000a3. Look for a rebound guy\u000aFirst of all, using someone else to get over your ex is unfair. Secondly, it does nothing for you emotionally, don\u2019t trust what people say.\u000a4. Mope around\u000aIt is difficult to just pick up the pieces of your life and move but the sooner you understand that this is what you have to do, the better. Moping around makes you stagnant while your ex has moved on; don\u2019t give him that satisfaction. \u000a5. Beg him\u000aHe does not want you anymore but you could still walk out of his life with your head held up high. The last thing you should do is try to hold on. \u000a6. Act like it doesn\u2019t hurt\u000aOf course, I said earlier that you should not mope around but it is best that you own up to the pain you are feeling. Tell a trusted friend about how you hurt for the sake of therapy. The more you talk about it, the more you will feel better.\u000aWhat is most important is that you leave with your dignity intact.\u000a

V - National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu says his visit to President Buhari was not connected to the letter written by Obasanjo\u000a- The APC leader said the meeting had earlier been planned\u000a- He said he met with the president to discuss substantive issues pertaining to the governance of the country and matters concerning the party\u000aAll Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, January 23, said that his visit to President Muhammadu Buhari was not connected with the critical statement issued by former president Olusegun Obasanjo on Buhari\u2019s presidency.\u000a Tunde Rahman of Tinubu\u2019s media office said the visit by Tinubu and Chief Bisi Akande, former governor of Osun state, to the presidential villa was scheduled since last week.\u000a\u201dPresident Buhari periodically schedules talks with Asiwaju Tinubu and Baba Akande, as he does with other Nigerians and APC figures, to discuss substantive issues pertaining to the governance of the country and matters concerning the party.\u000a\u201dThis visit was one of such meetings. As such, the meeting had nothing to do with the statement of former President Obasanjo.\u000a\u201dIt is totally unconnected. At the time of the meeting, Tinubu and Baba Akande were even unaware that President Obasanjo had released his statement,\u201d Rahman said.\u000aFormer President Obasanjo, in a statement released today urged President Buhari to abandon the idea of seeking re-election in 2019.\u000aIn the diatribe, which he entitled: \u201cThe Way Out: A Clarion Call for Coalition for Nigeria Movement\u201d, Obasanjo claimed Buhari has performed far below expectation and should honourably \u201cdismount from the horse\u201d.\u000aObasanjo urged the President to join the league of the country\u2019s former leaders whose \u201cexperience, influence, wisdom and outreach can be deployed on the side line for the good of the country.\u201d\u000aObasanjo, a two-term president on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said he felt disappointed by Buhari, whom he supported during the 2015 election over then incumbent and candidate of his former party, Goodluck Jonathan.\u000aWhile thanking Buhari for the effort of his administration in rolling back the Boko Haram insurgency and his fight against corruption, Obasanjo said Buhari has ultimately failed in other areas where he had thought he would be efficient.\u000aPAY ATTENTION: Read the news on Nigeria\u2019s #1 news app\u000aThe octogenarian, who bagged a PhD over the weekend, admitted he knew Buhari was weak in handling the economy, he went ahead and voted for him because at the time \u201cit was a matter of \u2018any option but Jonathan\u2019 and because he thought Buhari would appoint qualified Nigerians to help out in that area.\u000aHe slammed President Buhari for turning a blind eye to corruption within his government saying it amounted to condonation and cover-up saying whoever is \u201cgoing to justice must be with clean hands.\u201d\u000aHe also berated President Buhari for allowing the clashes between herdsmen and farmers to go \u201csour\u201d and messy saying the endorsement of the president by some governors to seek re-election barely 24 hours after 73 people who were killed by herdsmen in Benue state were given mass burial was \u201ca sad symptom of insensitivity and callousness.\u201d\u000aObasanjo, however, reserved his harshest words for what he described as Buhari\u2019s clannishness, lack of understanding of the dynamics of politics, and his tendencies to pass the buck of his government\u2019s inadequacies to the immediate past administration.\u000aObasanjo had issued similar statements against former leaders such as President Shehu Shagari, Ibrahim Babangida, General Sani Abacha, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan.\u000aThere has been no official reaction to the latest Obasanjo statement by the Buhari presidency.\u000aMeanwhile, NAIJ.com had earlier reported that President Muhammadu Buhari met the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Aso Rock in Abuja,on Tuesday, January 23.\u000aAccording to Bashir Ahmad, Chief Bisi Akande, a chieftain of the APC was also at the meeting.\u000aWho is Nigeria's greatest president ever? - on NAIJ.com TV:\u000aSource: Naija.ng\u000a

VCaves, in historic times, served as a place of shelter and defence.\u000aAs humans inhabited these caves, some became revered as a place of worship and a place for the preservation of religion.\u000aThe serenity and isolation from the rest of the world may have been two of the many reasons for preserving deities of different religions in caves. These caves, by virtue of having a diety, have been termed holy and mysterious.\u000aThis is why every year, tourists, as well as thousands of religious fanatic, flock these caves to offer prayers.\u000aSee some of the caves below:\u000aAwhum Waterfall And Cave \u2013 Nigeria\u000aThe water gotten from the waterfall is said to heal the sick and chases away evil spirits. Although there is, allegedly, documented evidence of this significant discovery, many swear by its healing powers. This is further heightened by the fact that a section of the water remains warm every season. It is also said that prayers offered to the Virgin Mary by Christian pilgrims at the Awhum Waterfall and cave gets prompt answers.\u000aAwhum Waterfall and Caves. Pinterest\u000aSaint Simon The Tanner \u2013 Egypt\u000aIn Egypt, a muslim-majority country, lies the largest church in the Middle East. The church is called the monastery of St. Simon the Tanner and is located in Mokattam where the Zabbaleen (Coptic Christians) dwell. It has a seating capacity of 20,000.\u000aCave Church In Egypt. Photo credit: Pinterest\u000aMonastry of Destiny- Romania\u000aThe 7,000-year-old Monastery of the Destiny goes by different names: the temple of faith, the monastery, and the Sinca Veche Temple. Strangely, the cave has two altars. A lot is unknown about the cave such as when it was sculpted, what the underground rooms are for, and the reason behind establishing two altars.\u000aOne has the symbol of the Judaism Star of David and the other, the Chinese Ying and Yang.\u000aTemple Of Destiny (Templul Ursitelor) The Star Of David. Photo credit: Goecaching\u000aEllora Cave \u2013 India\u000aThe Ellora cave is located in Maharashtra, India. The Ellora cave houses the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world. Out of the 100 caves broadly featuring Buddist, Hindu, and Jain deities, 34 are open for public viewing. The three deities were placed in the Ellora cave to signify the unity of religion in ancient India.\u000aOf all the caves, the Hindu Kailash cave is most profound for its monolithic rock excavation. Rashthrkuta King Krishna 1, is credit with constructing this chariot-like temple in the 8th century. It is believed that there are elephants carrying the building.\u000aEllora Caves\u000aPak Ou Caves \u2013 Laos\u000aThe Tham Ting (lower cave) and the Tham Theung (upper cave) are caves famous for their Buddha images. The story goes that Buddhist is the first to put a wooden Buddha statue there after the difficult and enduring journey to the cave. Since then, the cave has witnessed an influx of wooden Buddha statues. Each cave has a Buddist miniature statues doing something significant such as medicating and teaching.\u000aPak Ou Caves.

VThe Igala socio-cultural group, Uk\u2019Omu Igala organisation, has warned the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello not to donate any land from the state for the proposed cattle colonies.\u000aThe group in a press release yesterday, highlighted instances of Fulani herdsmen attacks on innocent farmers to support its rejection of the planned cattle colonies in the state.\u000aThe Uk\u2019Omu Igala Organisation, in an open letter signed by its National leader, Major General Patrick Akpa (rtd) and National Secretary, Malam Ahmed Hussain and addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, stated that the planned cattle colony in Kogi East Senatorial District would be incompatible with the agricultural activities of the Igala people.\u000a\u201cWhen unarmed farmers attempt to call the herders to order, the latter, who are usually armed with dangerous weapons, have them [farmers] butchered or mauled in cold blood.\u201d\u000a\u201cSelling our heritage and birth right to fuel his [governor\u2019s] political ambition, the decision of Governor Yahaya to grant indigene ship to Fulani in Kogi State and compel the traditional councils to include Fulani herders as members of the councils.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe have several other ethnic communities from other parts of Nigeria living and doing businesses in Kogi State for decades. Why is the governor making a special deal for cattle herders in Kogi State?\u201d\u000a\u201cThey [administrators] are not, in any way, elected representatives of the people of Kogi State. They are lackeys of Governor Yahaya Bello. We call on the Presidency, all Nigerians and the good people of Kogi State to disregard the ill-informed and self-serving advertorial by Kogi ALGON on this subject-matter.\u201d\u000aUk\u2019Omu Igala Organisation, however, called on President Buhari to reciprocate the support of the Igala nation to his government by citing Federal Government projects in Kogi East Senatorial District.\u000a

V Tom Tillett \u000a Congressional staffer for 31 years \u000a75w ago\u000aThere is no federal budget per se. There is a budget resolution that the House and Senate sometimes (and not) pass around April; however, it only recommends spending targets in the non defense domestic discretionary part of federal spending. This can also be understood as all the items that Congress must appropriate money for annually versus the vast majority of federal spending on automatic pilot. The \u201cbudget\u201d is best understood as the total spending when the 12 separate appropriations bills are combined. It has been many years since all 12 appropriations bills were actually passed. A few of the least controversial ones might get to the President\u2019s desk, but the controversial ones are often combined together into an \u201cOmnibus\u201d bill. Congress also now commonly uses \u201cContinuing Resolutions\u201d (CR) that keep the federal government operating at appropriated amounts based on the prior fiscal quarter. This is the current operating method. Last December a combination CR/Omnibus was combined into a \u201cCromnibus\u201d that spent $1.2 trillion. Not one dime of that amount was paid for. The entire amount is new debt sent to our children and grandchildren because Congress detests having to tell their constituents the truth because Americans have come to love free stuff (entitlements), and those same constituents will punish any politician who tells them the ugly truths where America is headed.\u000a William Griffith \u000a Lived here whole life. Taught History. \u000aIt does not work for the last 7 years. We have been under a continuous resolution to keep bills paid.\u000aIt should work by a budget being submitted, modified by congress, voted on and passed. Sent for signature and voila! budget! But it has not happened since 2009.\u000a Owen King \u000a studied at School of Hard Knocks \u000a76w ago\u000aIt doesn't anymore.\u000aThe government takes on more and more debt and lends it into existence. Hence the term \u201cfiat money.\u201d The government has been engaged in unconstitutional spending for way too long. Thus the budget is bad and so are all the debts. Any debts incurred through unconstitutional spending are void.\u000aMight want to re-word your answer and then think about how any bugget is supposed to work and there you will find your answer.\u000a

Vshare on: \u000aAs BBN Wonderland was beginning to hit its stride, celebrity designer, Mai Atafo, flew to Nigeria from China 5 days early to be with the 35 BBN Wonderland brides. \u000aDuring a special game session, the brides were split into three teams to square off in the \u2018Wonderland Fashion Week\u2019. They were to present three different wedding-themed looks from items from Mai\u2019s person collection. The brides were swift in trying to outwit one another for the win. At the end of the night, Mai picked Bridal Team Alpha for their apt storytelling as they managed to put together three outfits for a fairytale bride, her mother and her sister. \u000aBBN Wonderland is only going to get better as there are more fun activities at the main event scheduled for Saturday, 27th January at Eko Hotel & Suites. \u000a

V Lachie Smith \u000a PhD Making Fake Credentials & Stuff., Schools (1903) \u000a20w ago\u000aOkay I\u2019ve read pretty much all of these answers and only one talks about my favourite.\u000aNow, I\u2019m obsessed with commercial aircraft. My favourite plane is the 747\u20138. But it runs a fairly decent match with my other favourite,\u000aTHE BUFF.\u000aThe B-52 Stratofortress (known as the \u201cBig Ugly Fat ****er\u201d, or BUFF, by it's pilots), is a ridiculously cool plane. Not only is it super pretty to look at, but it\u2019s basically a massive middle finger to everybody. Why?\u000aWell for starters, it has eight (8!) of these:\u000a(photo taken on a 707, but they\u2019re the same engines)\u000aThese engines basically pump pollution into the air. When the B-52 is flying, thick black clouds follow it. Now I\u2019m all for efficiency, and I love the idea of making the world a better place, but IT\u2019S SO COOL!!!\u000aIt also has a tail gunner, just for lols.\u000aAnd why the funny wheels?\u000aBecause this aircraft is so wide, it will crash with even the slightest crosswinds.\u000aSo of course, the landing gear rotate to line up with the runway. Insanely cool, if you ask me.\u000aRunners up:\u000aBlue Angels F/A-18C.\u000aBecause that livery is basically just one massive turn-on.\u000aXB-70\u000aA lot of other answers have covered why it\u2019s \u2018cool\u2019, but it\u2019s also super pretty.\u000a747SP \u201cSOFIA\u201d\u000aSuch a pretty jet!\u000aMy second favourite aircraft, the 747SP is owned by NASA, and is used to TRACK STARS. This thing is one of the coolest aircraft ever, with a retracting door to conceal a massive telescope!\u000a*and more if I think of any*\u000aEdit: I thought of some more:\u000aThe infamous TU-144 actually was purchased by NASA for a flying testbed.\u000aEdit, again: Thanks for pointing out these facts on the BUFF:\u000aThe engines pictured were not used on the B-52H model, only the B-52s before that.\u000aSimilarly, the B-52H saw the removal of the tail gunner feature.\u000aThis, however, does not make the B-52H a bad aircraft. It has numerous upgrades from the B-52G and has been estimated to still be in active service 50 years from now (according to the Boeing website).\u000a Aman Shukla \u000a studied at Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology \u000a39w ago\u000aCurrently top 10 fighter aircraft in the world are these:\u000aThe F-16 was lighter, less expensive alternative to the F-15 Eagle. Unlike the F-15, which is purely an air superiority fighter, the F-16 is a multi-role aircraft, capable of attacking air and ground targets.\u000aThe F-16 has been produced in large numbers and participated in numerous conflicts. Over 4 500 aircraft have been built. It has been widely exported and is currently operational with 26 countries around the world. The F-16 is battle proven.\u000aThis aircraft is small, but highly maneuverable. The F-16 has a bubble single-piece canopy for excellent pilot visibility, which becomes during close combat.\u000aThe F-16 is still in service with the US Air Force and will remain operational until 2025. In the future it will be replaced by the new F-35 Lightning II.\u000aThe MiG-31 (NATO designation Foxhound-A) was developed as part of an overall programme to provide the Soviet air defenses with the ability to meet the threat posed by NATO low-level strike aircraft and cruise missiles.\u000aThis interceptor has a high speed, altitude and rate of climb, however it sacrifices maneuverability in order to achieve these capabilities. The MiG-31 is among the fastest production aircraft. It uses missiles to shot-down enemy aircraft at long distances.\u000aThe latest version is the MiG-31BM; this is billed as a true multi-role Foxhound, able to undertake long-range interception, precision strike and defense suppression tasks. Both cockpits feature advanced displays allowing the crew to deploy precision-guided munitions. A project to upgrade Russian interceptors to the MiG-31BM standard was begun in 2010. This interceptor continue to form the back bone of Russia's air defenses.\u000aIt is a purpose-built air superiority fighter designed to penetrate enemy defense.\u000aAlthough now in service for over 30 years, it remains a formidable warplane. This aircraft scored more than 100 air kills and is considered among the most successful Cold War era fighters.\u000aThe F-15 is equipped with weaponry and electronics, enabling it to detect, acquire, track and attack enemy aircraft, while operating in enemy-controlled airspace. This fighter carries a wide range of air-to-air missiles and is extremely maneuverable. Also it has strong high-speed maneuverability. Through modifications and upgrades the F-15 has been constantly improved.\u000aThe F-15 Eagle is still in service with the US Air Force and is expected to remain operational at least until 2025. This aircraft has been exported to Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia.\u000aThe Su-35 multi-role fighter is a significantly developed version of the Su-27. It is being offered for export as a replacement for the Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters. In 2012 it has been adopted by the Russian Air Force.\u000aDevelopers refer the Su-35 as 4++ generation fighter. It is a very fast and highly maneuverable fighter with very long range, high altitude capability and heavy armament. It poses great threat to Western 4+ generation fighters\u000aThe Su-35 is primarily an air superiority fighter. However it has secondary air-to-ground capability. This aircraft can carry enormous amount of weapons. It has 12 wing and fuselage hardpoints and can carry ordnance with a maximum weight of up to 8 000 kg.\u000aIts large and powerful engines give it ability to supercruise for a long time. Also its engines allow to reach supersonic speeds without using an afterburner. Engines have a three-dimensional thrust vectoring and make this aircraft very maneuverable.\u000aHowever Russia still lags behind in the development, acquisition and employment of some of the latest technologies.\u000aRecently a new Sukhoi PAK FA stealthy air superiority fighter is being developed in Russia. First operational aircraft might be delivered to the Russian air force in 2017-2018.\u000aThe Rafale is in service both with the French Air Force and Navy. This multi-role fighter\u000afeatures some of the very latest avionics systems.\u000aAlso some measures were taken to reduce radar cross section of this aircraft. This aircraft is very maneuverable. The Rafale can track 40 targets and fire at four targets simultaneously.\u000aThis aircraft can hold its own against the latest versions of the American F-16.\u000aThe Dassault Rafale will form the cornerstone of French air power until well into the 21st century\u000a5 Eurofighter Typhoon (European Union)\u000aIn 1986 the Eurofighter consortium was formed by Germany, Italy, the UK and, later, Spain, to develop a new multi-role combat aircraft, optimized as a beyond visual range interceptor with a secondary ground-attack capability.\u000aThis aircraft carries advanced European-designed missiles. it is fitted with a very modern and comprehensive avionics package.\u000aIt is claimed that Typhoon is half as combat effective as the American F-22 Raptor. It is an approximate estimate, however it seems that Typhoon is superior to the F-15F, French Rafale, evolved Russian Su-27 variants and many other aircraft.\u000aThe Eurofighter Typhoon will form the cornerstone of European air power until well into the 21st century.\u000aCurrently the Super Hornet is the most capable US Navy's multi-role fighter. It is based on the aircraft carriers can attack both air and surface targets. The Super Hornet is also in service with Australia as the main fighter aircraft.\u000aThe F/A-18E/F is a larger and more capable derivative of the F/A-18C/D Hornet. The Super Hornet is fitted with new engines. It has additional hardpoints and can carry more missiles. This aircraft has extended range due to larger internal storage of fuel. The Super Hornet also has improved avionics. Some measures were taken to reduce radar cross section of this aircraft.\u000aThe Chengdu J-20 is the new China's stealth fighter. It was designed to compete against other fifth-generation fighters, such as the US F-22 Raptor and Russian PAK-FA. It is speculated, that development of the J-20 was assisted by the Russian MiG aviation company. Low-rate initial production of this stealthy aircraft commenced in 2015. First operational J-20 stealthy fighters were delivered to Chinese air force in 2016.\u000aDuring the last decade China has taken a more transparent approach to its military programs. Still though there is little official information on this plane.\u000aMost likely that the new J-20 is a long-range air superiority fighter, which might also have a secondary ground attack capability. The new Chinese warplane might actually be an advanced forth-generation fighter, rather than a true fight-generation fighter.\u000aThis Chinese fighter has two large internal weapon bays for long-range air-to-air missiles and two small side-mounted weapon bays for short-range air-to-air missiles. Missiles are stored in these weapon bays in order to reduce the radar cross-section. It also has large fuel tanks for long-range missions. It carries more fuel and weapons than the American F-22 Raptor. Furthermore this aircraft is capable of high speed operations.\u000aThe F-35, also known as the Lightning II, is a new multi-role fighter. One of its variants, the F-35B achieved initial operational capability with the US Marine Corps in 2015.\u000aThe F-35 was developed under a Joint Strike Fighter program, which was intended to replace existing aircraft types with a common fighter. In the near future the F-35 will replace the AV-8B, A-10, F-16 and F/A-18 warplanes in service with the US military. Also it will be exported to a number of countries.\u000aThe F-35 has a configuration similar to that of Lockheed Martin's own F-22 design, however it is slightly smaller and has one engine. It exploits stealth technology, which reduces its radar cross-section and makes it harder to detect for radars\u000aThis multi-role fighter can perform on air defense missions, close air support and tactical bombing. It is compatible with the latest air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles.\u000aThis aircraft is proposed in three main variants, including the F-35A conventional take-off and landing aircraft, F-35B short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, and F-35C carrier-based aircraft. These variants share about 80% of their parts to keep development and production costs low. It also requires less logistic support.\u000aThe F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter is almost invisible to radars. This aircraft carries a powerful array of weaponry. It is the most advanced and most expensive production fighter aircraft to date. M\u000aany of sensors and avionics of this plane remain classified.\u000aEngines of the raptor allow the aircraft to supercruise over long ranges, while\u000athrust-vectoring nozzles, combined with a triplex fly-by-wire flight control system, make it exceptionally maneuverable.\u000aThe F-22 started life as a straightforward air superiority fighter. However since its introduction this aircraft lacks a formidable air threat from other countries fighters. Later it evolved towards the multi-role fighter, as strike capability was added.\u000aThis advanced aircraft\u000awas never offered for export customers, even other allies and NATO countries. Currently it is the best fighter aircraft ever built.\u000a Connor Hughes \u000a studies Political Science at Appalachian State University (2021) \u000a12w ago\u000a\u201cI have become death, destroyer of worlds.\u201d\u000aLadies and gentlemen, the most powerful aircraft ever built, the F-22 Raptor.\u000aWhat makes this thing so badass? One word: Stealth.\u000aImagine that you're a Russian pilot in charge of enforcing air superiority. You're cruising around, and all of a sudden the missile lock signal starts beeping, but there is no plane on the radar. You might dodge the first missile, but you won't be able to dodge six.\u000aThis plane has a incredibly large radar range and can detect planes miles before they SHOULD be within the range of the enemy\u2019s radar. It fires a missile and kills the bird without the enemy ever seeing it. I've read reports that the F-22 has the same radar signature as a steel marble despite being the size of a tennis court.\u000aThis is even without mentioning the ability to supercruise and coordinate with other planes.\u000aPeople will knock it for its record in mock dogfighting, but here's the point: it will never have to get into a dogfight. It will simply shoot down the enemy plane before anyone knows that the F-22 is there.\u000aThis is the best air superiority fighter ever created, and will probably maintain that status for the next 30ish years.\u000aWhat's cooler than being able to do your task when the enemy doesn't even know you're there? You can't exactly kill something that you can't see.\u000aRunner ups: F-117, B-2, and A-10\u000a

His death made his 8-months-pregnant high school sweetheart a widow and a soon-to-be single mom.\u000aA decade earlier, a suicide attempt left Andy Sandness disfigured. For ten years, he lived with a quarter-sized mouth and a prosthetic nose. He hated going out in public, especially in big cities, as he was ashamed of his injuries.\u000aIn 2010, the Mayo Clinic started exploring a face transplant program and in early 2016, Andy was wait-listed for the procedure.\u000aAfter Rudy\u2019s death, Lilly decided to donate his organs, including his face. Andy became the recipient of that face after a 56-hour surgery.\u000aSixteen months later, this past October, Lilly and Andy met for the first time. At first, the widow was apprehensive about seeing her deceased husband\u2019s face on another man, but she ultimately wants her son to see the gifts he left behind.\u000aThanks to him, Andy can enjoy the little things in life, like chewing a piece of pizza.\u000aThe emotional reunion brought Andy and Lilly\u2019s family closer than ever and was therapeutic for the widow, who has been grieving for over a year. Andy doesn\u2019t want their relationship to end with a face transplant, so he has decided to contribute to a trust fund for Lilly And Rudy\u2019s son\u2019s education.\u000a

Specifically, between human and chimpanzee[1].\u000aSpecies that are closely genetically related sometimes produce offspring that are evolutionary dead ends, meaning that the child is sterile and cannot continue the line.\u000aMy suggestion, don't try it.

Biotechnology from St. Xavier's College, Ahmedabad (2019) \u000a28w ago\u000aWell, I am not sure for the mating between human and monkeys, but the mating between Lions and Tigers is possible. Not only them, but Mating between Donkey and Horse is also possible.\u000aThe mating between them produces Ligers and Tigons.\u000aThe Liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). The Liger has parents in the same genus but of different species.\u000aA tigon or tiglon is a hybrid cross between a male tiger (Panthera tigris) and a female lion (Panthera leo). Thus, it has parents with the same genus but of different species.\u000a Nirmalananda Reddy Kasivi \u000a former Emeritus Professor in Anthropology (Biological) at Sri Venkateswara University (1992-2010) \u000a29w ago\u000aMating among humans and monkeys is not feasible, because, they are varied species wise and also varied in chromosomal number. Though they have evolutionary relationship but were separated from evolutionary lineage long back. Hence, mating between humans and monkeys is not possible.\u000a Utkarsh Chachad \u000a Movie addict, Science enthusiast, Free thinker \u000a30w ago\u000aWe have 23 pairs of chromosomes in our DNA. When a sperm & the egg unite 23 chromosomes from the sperm & 23 chromosomes from the egg are selected to form 23 pairs of chromosomes in the offspring. So for a perfect union the number of chromosomes must match. Apes on the other hand have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Hence a perfect union cannot be achieved and hence a zygote is not formed.\u000a

V Brian Collins \u000a I am Mrrrican living in Australia, and do know stuff about our history and laws. \u000a30w ago\u000aThe US is not a strategic chokepoint. US bases are mainly either in strategic chokepoints like Thule Greenland or Okinawa, or in places along supply lines between Germany and the Middle East.\u000aThere are also no US bases in Australia (although there are some US troops):\u000aWhy?\u000aAustralia is not a strategic chokepoint either.\u000aNorth America is not contested territory and neither is Australia. Everyone knows that if World War III happens, all of the battles will be fought in Europe and Asia. If anything happens in North America, it will be Russian planes flying from Siberia for strategic bombing, which is one reason why NORAD exists.\u000aI am actually sure that if Canada asked the US to build a base, and said they would pay for it, the US would at least consider the idea. Canadian troops are already working on US bases and have been since the Cold War; we share the same Air Defense Sector:\u000aIn emergencies, Canadian fighter jets sometimes even patrol American airspace (such as on 9/11).\u000aEdit:\u000aThere is a German post is Reston Virginia and in New Mexico.\u000aIt is mostly to coordinate training for German pilots. German military pilots are trained in the US.\u000a David Kenagy \u000a works at Private Practice \u000a20w ago\u000aA U.S. military base in another country is there by mutual agreement. Either side can decide not to make (or continue) an agreement.\u000aBases in the Germany and Japan after WWII were not open to two-way negotiation at first, but Cold War tensions later made both Germans and Americans want a US base. Now, as the location of strategic threats change, and technologies advance, the economics drive new decisions. One example was the closure of Rhein-Main Air Base (Frankfurt). It gave back extremely valuable land on the south side of the Frankfurt airport. Another major change was the Philippine decision that we should leave Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station. Some feel that was an important declaration of Philippine sovereignty. Others regret the huge economic loss that our departure caused.\u000aAlthough no other country has bases within US borders that have (so far) been used in all of the ways US bases abroad have, other countries have a long-standing military presence here. One of the more interesting is the German Air Force at Holloman AFB, New Mexico (near Alamogordo). They have a very substantial operation, training German pilots in German aircraft (e.g. the Tornado- not one of our aircraft). Why? Alamogordo has 330 days of sunshine per year\u2026something I certainly did NOT see during my German assignment! Driving into a New Mexico town, one expects to see Hispanic stores and Spanish signs. So it's especially interesting to see the sign that reads, \u201cWillkommen in Alamogordo\u201d.\u000a Howard C. Berkowitz \u000a A few decades as a student of, and consultant, esp. C3ISR; wrote much on Wikis \u000a57w ago\u000aThere are a number of cooperative training facilities, as with Germany, at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, which will be closing. German Air Force leaving Holloman by 2019\u000aThe North American Air Defense Command is joint US-Canadian, headquartered in Colorado.\u000aThere are a number of joint activities, such as Supreme Allied Commander Transportation, headed by a French general in Norfolk.\u000a Matthew Bates \u000a Teacher (2009-present) \u000a31w ago\u000aThis may have been said already, so I apologize if I\u2019m stealing someone\u2019s thunder. But there are two easy answers:\u000aLegacies from previous wars.\u000aThe US doesn\u2019t need help protecting itself.\u000aI know what some of you are thinking:\u000a\u201cThe US only protects its own interests! A lot of the citizens of countries where the US has bases don\u2019t want them there! The US is just being a bully!\u201d\u000aOk then, the US doesn\u2019t need help protecting itself or its own interests, and has the military resources to extend its reach beyond its own borders.\u000aWhy doesn\u2019t, say, Costa Rica put a base in the US? Why would they? They have no reason to, and they probably wouldn\u2019t want to spend the money on it anyway.\u000a

V Bas Leijser \u000a likes to read about history and visit historical places \u000aJul 10\u000aThat would be each invasion of Hans Island by both Denmark and Canada.\u000aHans Island is a barren rock with a meager [math]1.3km^2[/math] surface area, located between Greenland and Canada. It also lies in the territorial waters of both Denmark and Canada. In 1973, both nations claimed the territorial right to Hans Island and this has been a dispute between them ever since[1].\u000aFortunately, the military is less serious about this than the government, and their \u2018invasions\u2019 consist of removing the other nation\u2019s flag, replacing it with their own and leaving a bottle of Snaps or Canadian Club behind (the Canadians also like to leave a sign, which reads: \u2018Welcome to Canada\u2019).\u000aEach of these invasions takes only a couple of hours at most and a few months to a year later, it would be the other country\u2019s turn to invade.\u000aLocation of Hans Island:\u000aFootnotes\u000a Dylan Rivera \u000a living and making history everyday \u000aJul 8\u000aThe Swiss Invasion of Liechtenstein\u000aSwitzerland has given a whole new meaning to the term \u201c"surprise attack\u201d.\u000aA Swiss company of 171 soldiers all armed with rifles (but no ammunition) marched across the Liechtensteiner border in the early morning of March 1, 2007. However, it was a mistake - the entering of Liechtenstein was due to the darkness from the night, as the soldiers had no intentions to walk into Liechtenstein. They walked about 2 KM within into the territory of Liechtenstein before noticing their mistake and turned back. Apparently, not even the authorities in Liechtenstein noticed that the Swiss company paraded into their borders until after Switzerland notified Liechtenstein about the accidental invasion (that must've been awkward).\u000aThe Liechtensteiner government didn't seek retaliation and didn't mind the invasion at all. In the words of Markus Amman, a Liechtensteiner interior ministry spokesperson at the time, \u201cIt's not like they stormed over here with attack helicopters or something\u201d.\u000aBefore this, Switzerland also accidentally bombed Liechtenstein in 1985 (causing a forest fire). Swiss cadets on duty to set up an observation post walked into Treisenberg, Liechtenstein by accident in 1992 as well. The Liechtensteiner government said nobody noticed any of these \u201cinvasions\u201d, except for the forest fire one - which caused a diplomatic headache and was settled when Switzerland paid compensation for the environmental damage to Liechtenstein.\u000aThe two states maintain a close relationship today, where Liechtenstein sees Switzerland as their protector. Citizens of the two countries easily cross their borders each day and speak the same German dialect and use the same money.\u000aSo in the end, Switzerland keeps its reputation as a neutral, peaceful country. Unless all this time the Swiss government has been trying to steal all the numerous fake teeth in Liechtenstein, the world\u2019s largest producer of false teeth\u2026\u000a Bill Denert \u000a studied History at University of Hartford (1976) \u000aJul 7\u000aThe Anglo-Zanzibar war. It started on August 25, 1896 after the death of Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini who was pro-British. Khalid bin Barghash was installed as the new Sultan of Zanzibar, but the British didn't approve of him. Two days later, on August 27, British warships bombarded the Sultan's palace, destroying it and thirty eight minutes later, Zanzibar asked for a cease fire. It has gone down as the shortest war in history.\u000a John McKay \u000a studied at University of Washington \u000aJul 7\u000aThat would be the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896. The entire war took 38-45 minutes. The war was occasioned by the death of the sultan. Under the terms of an earlier treaty, the succession of a new sultan had to be approved by the British. Khalid bin Barghash Al-Busaid seized the throne and defied the British to do anything about it. The British, in turn, gave him until 9:00 AM on August 27 to step down. Two minutes after the ultimatum expired, the British began shelling the palace. The British sank the royal yacht, which made up the bulk of the Zanzibari navy. At 9:40 the flag on the palace was shot down, which was close enough to a surrender for the British. They ceased firing and sent a detachment ashore to secure the palace. Khalid fled to the German consulate.\u000aStated like that, as it often is, it sounds like a splendid little Gilbert and Sullivan second act. But the tiny war involved live ammunition and soft human flesh. The defenders of the palace were mostly conscripted townspeople and slaves. The British used high explosive shells which set fire to the palace and harem. Over 500 Zanzibaris were killed or injured, mostly by the fire. British sailors were needed to contain and extinguish the fire which overwhelmed the town's capacity to fight. Part of the population rioted and looted the town's Indian quarter, where another 20 people were killed. Finally, Khalid's supporters were identified and made to pay for the ammunition spent deposing him.\u000aEven cute wars are hell.\u000a

V Jos Prez \u000a Watching too much football lately. \u000a124w ago\u000aKovacic is being signed as the main substitute midfielder for Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. \u000aGiven what we've seen from friendly matches and signings, Real Madrid will play most likely a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos as the starting "double pivot" midfielders (the two midfielders closest to the defensive line)\u000aIt's a surprising decision coming from a defensive coach like Benitez. It seems he has decided, just like Ancelotti did, that when you have a squad with so many splendid passers, it's worth sacrificing defensive safety for greater passing consistency, fluidity and creativity. \u000aHowever, Modric missed 32 matches this season due to injury, and he'll be 30 years old next month, so there is good reason to worry about his physical shape for the upcoming seasons. While Kroos did not have a major injury last year, he will "burn out" physically without a good substitute. \u000aWhy does Real Madrid need Kovacic when they already have Ilarramendi and Lucas? \u000aSimply put, Benitez (like Ancelotti before him) doesn't think they're good enough substitutes.\u000aI think it's safe to say now that Ilarramendi has failed at the club, mostly due to a lack of confidence and character. He's a decent defensive asset at the moment, but his passing ability has suffered greatly due to his lack of confidence.\u000aLucas was signed to do the work Ilarra was unable to do during the 2014-15 season. While he is still considered a promising player, his development will take more time than expected, and he'll probably need to play 1-2 years in a lower-ranked team to before he's allowed back in the Real Madrid squad.\u000aSo in practice, last season Modric and Kroos didn't have a substitute. This was evident when Ancelotti used Ramos as a Modric substitute instead of Lucas or Ilarra.\u000aBut, but...isn't Kovacic more of an attack-minded midfielder?\u000aDo not be fooled by Kovacic's great attacking runs and dribbling skills:\u000aWhile those attacking runs and dribbles have become sort of his "signature move" at Inter, his evolution as a player will probably mirror that of Kroos and Modric themselves. Remember both players started out as attacking midfielders before moving into more "defensive playmaker" kind of roles.\u000aEven now, Kovacic's role at Roberto Mancini's Inter is more that of a central midfielder in a 4-3-1-2 formation, with some occasional use as an attacking midfielder. \u000aSo, is it a good signing?\u000aConsidering Benitez's game plan, Ilarra's failure and Lucas's inexperience, and the cost of "superstar" signings like Verratti or Pogba (which were not really needed), I think Real Madrid signing Kovacic makes a lot of sense.\u000aI am assuming that Ilarra and Lucas will be sold/loaned out due to this signing. Even if they're not, I still expect Kovacic to be ahead of them in the team's pecking order.\u000a Shahul Rashik \u000a Madridista, Football Blogger \u000a82w ago\u000aWhen the news broke that Real Madrid were buying Mateo Kovacic from Inter Milan, the general reaction was a rather confused "why?"\u000aIt's an understandable impulse -- after all, this is the same Real Madrid that already have Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez and Isco filling the two spots he's most capable of filling.\u000aSo why did they do it? Well, this is Real Madrid. They're never afraid to splash a ton of cash on a player that doesn't fill any kind of obvious hole. In this case, bringing in a talent like Kovacic actually makes a certain kind of sense.\u000aMadrid's most obvious midfield need is a more defensive-minded presence in the center of the pitch, and that's not really Kovacic's forte. Make no mistake, he's a try-hard, willing-to-make-the-effort player when his side isn't on the ball, but at this stage of his career, his actual effectiveness in defense is often lacking. Instead, he's more of a playmaking mold, either working in the hole behind the striker or starting a little deeper in midfield. It's a role very similar to one in which Madrid employs his fellow Croatian international, Modric.\u000aBut there's one thing that Kovacic gives Real Madrid that they were apparently willing to pay a premium for: security.\u000aModric missed 32 matches across all competitions between two separate injuries last season. James missed another nine when he fractured his foot in the February. Modric's injuries forced Madrid to run Kroos into the ground, leaving him an exhausted and ineffective shell of himself by year's end. James being out forced them to play mix-and-match in their attack before Isco finally rounded into form. Those losses hurt Madrid badly, and both the La Liga title race and Champions League could have looked much different if Madrid's depth had been better in midfield.\u000aKovacic's presence in the side, and his ability to play either behind the striker or as a deeper playmaker, gives Madrid that missing security blanket in case of a repeat of those problems. He provides them them safety and depth they can rely on, and few quality teams can boast of that on their roster. It also gives Madrid the freedom to consider selling someone next summer, knowing they have a ready made replacement already in the squad.\u000aAt the high transfer fee of \u20ac32 million, Kovacic makes for an expensive security blanket. With only one other big purchase this summer, Madrid can easily afford to make the splash now and survive under the strictures of Financial Fair Play. At 21 years old, Kovacic is also something of a buy for the future, giving Madrid time to use him in a more depth-oriented role for now, while they figure out what to do with him in a couple of years.\u000aWith the incredible potential he's flashed at times over the last two years at Inter, there's a very good chance that Kovacic makes that fee look like a steal. And if he doesn't, it's not a big deal. Madrid can afford to take a gamble like this every now and then without hurting themselves. In the meantime, though, this has all the appearances of a very good move for Real Madrid to make.\u000a Jai Vyas \u000a Young football analyst in a writer's body \u000a124w ago\u000aMateo Kovacic is a player with a lot of potential, play Football Manager and you'll know just how much. \u000aAs mentioned by others, Inter Milan were forced to sell him to comply with FFP, plus, when Real Madrid come calling, a club may say no as much as they want, but Real get their man, eventually. Man Utd fan here, I know this feeling all too well. \u000aAlso mentioned earlier, Rafa Benitez is Real's new manager and having spent time in Italy, it is fair to assume that he must have had his eye on a good amount of players in that league and Kovacic must have caught his eye. He is young, fairly strong and quick, is decent defensively and can score and create goals very well. Overall a very good prospect. Any good team would want him. Very few can afford him, however. \u000aIf this was Benitez's decision to bring him to Real, I'm slightly surprised, because he already has a lot of options in that position and that is not necessarily a good thing. Unless he plans to sell one midfielder, which I don't think he will, this isn't that good of a decision and he should have gone for a more defensive minded midfielder, somebody like the Sami Khedira they just lost to Juve. If, however, this decision was made by Florentino Perez, I'm not very surprised. I had a thought one day that Perez has some sort of complex, and that he wants all the best players for himself, well, at least those that he can have within the realm of reality. That can explain why Real have gone after a player the type of which they already have in abundance.\u000aThanks for the A2A.\u000a

V Drew Davis \u000a studied at Texas A&M University \u000a161w ago\u000aTo answer this properly would take a long thick volume I'll just list a few of the most obvious reasons, but first I have to make a point. The United States is a big country, and it didn't all develop at the same time. In fact, the process of development isn't complete even yet. There are still parts of the country that are undergoing development and others that have barely begun the process. Remember, parts of the east coast were settled by the 1700's, and some states in the Rockies didn't form for another 150 years after that. \u000aThe northeastern and mid-Atlantic coast was the earliest part of the country to develop. Obviously, these were that areas most accessible to the colonizing powers, but more importantly, it was the people who settled there. Unlike most European colonies, that were created and settled by people intent on extracting the maximum amount of wealth and resources out of the land, and who viewed their colonial sojourns as temporary exiles to be ended once they acquired that wealth and returned to their mother nation. a lot of the Settlers were sent or came here because they didn't fit in with the prevailing religious beliefs of the mother country. They came here not expecting ever to return. Because of that difference, they were more intent on becoming self sufficient than other kinds of colonists. They were starting a new life.\u000aNorth America was also a rich new continent, with lots of raw materials needed in long settled Europe. The colonies had a seemingly endless supply of lumber, which was becoming scarce in Europe. Because of that, shipbuilding became establishes early on in the first colonies, and the best shipbuilders in Europe migrate here to be closer to the fine tall timber that would make up the masts and keels of a new generation of both war and merchant vessels. Those were the first two advantages, the intent of the colonists and the availability of raw materials. \u000aTiming was critical, as well. the colonies came into their own at a time when industrialization was just beginning to flower. The Unite States had the advantage there as well in that the colonies were still relatively unsettled. There was lots of land available to set up factories. In Europe, which had been completely settled for centuries, industrialization had to take place on land that was already long settled and often owned by people who didn't want their lands altered. So industrialization was able to get a faster foothold in the United States than anyplace else in Europe. \u000aThe third big advantage was a favorable location for trade. \u000aWhen you sail by the wind, it's easier to take advantage of the prevailing currents. To travel east from Europe, the most direct way is actually to ail south to around the latitude of the Canary Islands and then head west, tacking against the prevailing winds to take advantage of the equatorial currents. Once you crossed the Atlantic and hit the coast of South America, it was easier to sail north on the currents to go past the islands of the Caribbean. These were already economically significant. In fact, they were the most economically significant real estate in the New World, mainly because they were able to support huge sugar plantations, since sugar cane doesn't grow well in the Mediterranean region. Sugar was the fuel that supported the population growth of Europe, and it was in short supply there. That sugar could also be fermented into rum, which was an ideal cargo to make money with. It was in demand everywhere, and it was compact and stable over the weeks or months it would take to ship it across the Atlantic. When returning to Europe, it was easier and faster to catch the Gulf Stream and take advantage of the prevailing westerly winds to hustle you across the Atlantic back to Europe. That circular route, from the Canary Islands east to South America, north to the Caribbean , further north to the ports along the eastern seacoast, and from there back to Europe, was the pulse of international trade, and it went right past the biggest and newest shipbuilding center in the world. That made Charleston, New York and Boston the centers for trade in the new world.\u000aThere are many more reasons, but those four, the nature of the colonists, the early rise of shipbuilding because of all the lumber, and the early adoption of industrialization, coupled with the favorable position for trade were the four biggest things that led to the United States developing more rapidly than other parts of the world. \u000aI can't take credit for this answer, it was provided by a member of Yelshir a social network only smart people can join.\u000a Joseph Wong \u000a Semi-retiree at Coldwell Banker Dynasty (1999-present) \u000a59w ago\u000aLet\u2019s first examine what is a developed country:\u000aA developed country, industrialized country, or "more economically developed country" (MEDC), is a sovereign state that has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate.\u000aDeveloped countries have post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector. They are contrasted with developing countries, which are in the process of industrialization, or undeveloped countries, which are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian. As of 2015, advanced economies comprise 60.8% of global GDP based on nominal values and 42.9% of global GDP based on purchasing-power parity (PPP) according to the International Monetary Fund. In 2015, the ten largest advanced economies by GDP in both nominal and PPP terms were Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Developed country - Wikipedia\u000aNow that you know about the criteria and the next is to learn about the history of the United States so you can see how the USA became the most one. Like mother like son is the best explanation when the United Kingdom was recognized as the First Developed country followed by Belgium then the rest as mentioned above.\u000aThe Industrial Revolution in the United States was attributed to one man Samuel Slater. An English cotton mill worker who learned that United States was badly in need of new industrial technologies that was prohibited to export by England. So he memorized as much as he could and parted England for America. He offered his services to Brown in Rhode Island and earned a fortune as well as the name \u201cFather of American Industrial Revolution\u201d while being called a traitor back home.\u000aThat was in the 18th century. Then came the Gilded Age that lasted from late 1800 to 1900 when European immigrants flooded to the US for better wage and living conditions. This is the time the US took the lead from the United Kingdom as the new leading developed country with new factories, railroads, coal mining, and advances in technology development. The power of immigrants who brought along talents, trade expertise, and capitals.\u000aThen the Roaring 20s came into a halt with the Great Depression that set the US back a few notches. What propelled the US as a leader again was WWII that pretty much crippled the entire Europe and Asia. Other than Pearl Harbor, the US soil was untouched and suffered little. With its factories intact and all the men returned as war heroes, the golden era began with the US dollar signing as The World Currency in 1944 during the Bretton Woods Conference.\u000aEven today, the United States ranks number one in international immigration with 19% of total international immigrants. Personally, I think the US is a country by the immigrant and should always be in flavor of immigrants instead of afraid of it. It\u2019s appalling how stupid politicians or president wannabe wanting to shut the doors on immigrants. This young country of 200 plus years out performed all other more mature developed countries because they have been absorbing the best from the rest of the world.\u000aThe founding fathers were all European immigrants, then fortified by immigrants from all over the world. It was developed by immigrants and their descendants who have poured their heart and soul to make this a great country. USA was the number one until they decided to move their factories to China. While Samuel Slater smuggled technology from England to the US, the US voluntarily shipped their technologies to China and for what? Talk about slaughtered the goose that keeps on laying the golden egg. Did these airhead corporate leader knew that you have nothing left for the middle class Americans when you take away their source of labor?\u000aSo what if the service sector or the healthcare sector thrives. These industries are only good when people can afford to pay for their services. Americans need industrial and manufacturing jobs. Not all these goods made in China and other underdeveloped countries. America is developing into a country with most of its citizens depending on government jobs and handouts. Look at the Trump supporters. Hillary was kind to call them deplorable. How can they support a guy who has no respect for others, no experiences in government and no plans for the future other than alienating all its neighboring countries.\u000aThese certifiable blind supporters were so gullible that they are willing to worship a guy that has filed bankruptcy um teen times as a business genius. A guy that acts like a byproduct of spoiled brat and pervert whose behavior is so repulsive that didn\u2019t fit as a human being let alone being a president. An antagonist liar who can lie with a straight face under the spot light while throwing a temper tantrum to all those questioning his integrity. I\u2019m sure that the days of America as a developed country will end when Trump became president. A development I don\u2019t want to witness ever.\u000a Edgar Lin \u000a161w ago\u000aOf all of the European colonies, the ones that would become the United States of America were probably the most developed. \u000aThe Spanish colonies experienced little economic development, with the Spanish prioritizing squeezing as much gold and profits from them in the short term. Canada was the too sparsely populated.\u000aMeanwhile, the United States had developed a relatively independent economy based on agriculture and basic manufacturing. It was in these colonies that raw goods from the other colonies would be processed and shipped back to Europe. \u000aIt was also in these colonies that democracy and rule of law were already firmly established before independence. When the United States became independent, they didn't need to establish democracy, the British had already established it for them. This gave them a large start over other colonies. \u000aBecause of this, it was not very far behind the most advanced European nations at that time. However, due to the vast amount of land that the United States came to control, the United States of America soon overwhelmed all competition because we had more resources.\u000a

V- The Benue Youth Forum has raised an alarm on the activities of a wanted fellow in the state, Terwase Akwaza also known as Gana\u000a- The forum accused Gana of acting on the script and sponsorship of enemies of Benue state to foment trouble\u000a- The Benue state government has since declared Gana wanted\u000aThe Benue Youth Forum has raised an alarm on the activities of a wanted fellow in the state, Terwase Akwaza also known as Gana.\u000aIn a statement sent to NAIJ.com today, Thursday, January 25 by its president, Terrence Kuanum, the forum accused Gana of acting on the script and sponsorship of enemies of Benue state to foment trouble.\u000aAccording to the statement, enemies of Benue state have been making frantic efforts to instigate a communal clash in the state to justify insinuations that the recent herdsmen attacks were as a result of the clashes.\u000aGovernor Samuel Ortom has since declared Terwase Akwaza wanted. Photo credit: Sodiq Adelakun\u000aPart of the statement read: \u201cFew days ago, a stage-managed crisis started between the Shitile community of Katsina-Ala and Ukum community of Ukum local government areas.\u000a\u201cThe execution of the attacks had a trademark similar to the coordinated attacks recently carried out by our invaders who left 73 people dead in Logo and Guma local government areas.\u000a\u201cIt therefore left us with no option than to conclude that the mercenaries who readily make their 'services' available to the sponsors of mayhem in Benue were at it again. They are being used against their people. \u000a\u201cIt is unfortunate that both the persons hiring the mercenaries and the mercenaries themselves came after a united Benue this time and met a resolve that was too strong to perpetrate their act.\u201d\u000aThe forum urged Benue indigenes to remain more united in the face of the state's present challenges. \u000a\u201cWe are up against a cabal which is ready to go the extra mile to see that Benue is either captured or destroyed. Only our unity and strong resolve to stand firm can salvage our state from the jaws of this bloodthirsty monster.\u000a\u201cThis act has also vindicated the government of Benue state led by Governor Samuel Orton who they have always insisted has links with their hired mercenaries. Today, Nigerians can see the real enemy of Benue.\u000a\u201cBenue Youth Forum urges security agencies to as a matter of urgency arrest Terwase Akwaza AKA Gana for perpetrating such a dastardly act against his people acting on the script and sponsorship of enemies of the state. Gana has already been declared wanted by the Government of Benue State over his crimes against the people. His arrest will also expose his paymasters and bring them to justice.\u000a\u201cWe also urge the affected communities to put their pain behind them as it is part of the sacrifices we are making to protect our God-given territories from the scourge of invaders,\u201d the statement said.\u000aThe forum had earlier rejected the recent report presented to President Muhammadu Buhari by the Department of the State Services (DSS) on the killings in the state.\u000aThey urged the president to reject the report of the DSS and sack the director general of the agency without delay for failing in his responsibility and abating genocide in the country. \u000aThey also called for the immediate deployment of the military to the Benue valley to stop the killing of innocent persons in the state. \u000aVictims of herdsmen killing buried in Benue state - on NAIJ.com TV\u000aSource: Naija.ng\u000a

VNo parent ever wants to imagine their child will have to go through serious surgery as just a baby.\u000aNew Zealand mom Sarah Bowers was faced with that reality when her infant son, Mason, was 16 weeks old. The devoted mom was looking back at photos she had taken of Mason by the fire when she noticed a strange golden glow in her son\u2019s left eye.\u000aOn the Facebook page Little Mason\u2019s Journey, Sarah explained:\u000aMason\u2019s journey began on a Monday night like every other. After enjoying a nice warm bath in front of the fire, Mason endured the usual photoshoot I often put him through, only this time I noticed he had a \u2018golden glow\u2019 in his left eye on all the photos I had taken, I spent the evening concerned about what I had seen as I remembered reading a story while I was pregnant about a little boy called Benjamin Webber and how his mum had noticed the \u2018golden glow\u2019 in her sons eye and it led to a 1/100,000 rare disease called Coat\u2019s Disease. \u000aPhotos: Sarah Bowers; Facebook / Little Mason\u2019s Journey\u000aThe next day Mason went to his GP and she immediately was alarmed by what she saw in Mason\u2019s eye and phoned to have him referred to the eye specialist. \u000aThe next morning I took Mason to the eye specialist and after examination the eye specialist confirmed that Mason was in fact completely blind in his left eye, I was completely shocked and devastated to learn this news as other than a staph infection in that eye he had never had any signs of being blind, his pupil dilates, the eye follows things and responds to light etc.. then the eye specialist went on mentioning words like Coat\u2019s Disease and even worse Retinoblastoma (a rare eye cancer that is found in young children). \u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aWe were then flown up to Auckland the next morning to see an eye doctor who had dealt with cases of Retinoblastoma and other eye conditions. Mason was put under a general anesthetic so he could be examined, it was confirmed from this that he has a detached retina and is 100% blind in his left eye and has no hope of recovering any sight to the eye. \u000aHowever the results from the examination were not common of those seen in patients with Retinoblastoma so the doctor was more confident that this my not be the case with Mason. \u000aUnfortunately because of the uncertainty and the fact that the eye had been deemed \u2018useless\u2019 the doctor advised our best and safest choice for Mason would be to remove his eye, in doing so they remove the risk of whatever is wrong with the eye of spreading and also they can put the eye under a microscope and properly diagnose Mason. \u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aMason was diagnosed with Coats\u2019 Disease, a rare disease that causes blindness.\u000aAccording to the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, \u201cCoats\u2019 disease is caused by a problem with the arteries and veins (blood vessels) inside the eye that provide blood and oxygen to the retina.\u201d\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aEventually, in August 2015, Mason underwent surgery to have his left eye removed.\u000aMason\u2019s surgery went well, and he seemed happy as he recovered.\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aSince Mason didn\u2019t have vision in his left eye to begin with, he made the transition to having no eye quickly.\u000aLater, the adorable baby was fitted with a prosthetic eye.\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aIt took Mason some time to adjust to the prosthetic \u2014 his mom admits he would rub it and it fell out once in a while.\u000aWhen he was really little, he even tried to eat it!\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aNow, is almost three, happy and healthy, and thriving with his prosthetic eye. His mom told LittleThings that he\u2019s \u201cbecoming aware of his different eye\u201d and \u201che tells us when he wants it in or out.\u201d\u000aHe also recently became a big brother when his mom gave birth to a little girl!\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aMom Sarah is now speaking out about Coats\u2019 disease and encouraging other parents to pay attention if they ever notice a \u201cglow\u201d in their children\u2019s eyes.\u000aSarah raises awareness for Know the Glow, a nonprofit that helps identify \u201cpreventable glow-related childhood eye diseases.\u201d\u000aFacebook / Little Mason's Journey\u000aAccording to their website, Know the Glow\u2019s mission is to \u201craise public awareness for glow-related eye diseases and drive action to prevent childhood blindness.\u201d\u000aSarah says looking back at Mason\u2019s photos, it\u2019s easy to see the glow now, but she never noticed it at the time.\u000aSarah Bowers\u000a

VNo parent ever wants to imagine their child will have to go through serious surgery as just a baby.\u000aNew Zealand mom Sarah Bowers was faced with that reality when her infant son, Mason, was 16 weeks old. The devoted mom was looking back at photos she had taken of Mason by the fire when she noticed a strange golden glow in her son\u2019s left eye.\u000aOn the Facebook page Little Mason\u2019s Journey, Sarah explained:\u000aMason\u2019s journey began on a Monday night like every other.

V\u2022Ex-Gambian President Yahya Jammeh\u000aPresident Yahya Jammeh had found a cure for AIDS. That was the news that reached Ousman Sowe, the head of a Gambian AIDS support network, one day in 2007. He was overjoyed.\u000a\u201cWe all went with the hope that we were going to take a drop of some wonderful medication and be cured,\u201d Sowe, 64, a tall man with greying hair, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an office outside Gambia\u2019s rundown seaside capital.\u000aBut he was not allowed to go home after showing up at the state house that day. Gambia\u2019s ex-president Jammeh forced him to drink herbal concoctions morning and night for seven months until he was declared cured \u2013 but in reality, near death.\u000aJammeh, whose 22-year rule over the tiny West African country was marked by accusations of human rights abuses, fled into exile last year after losing an election.\u000aNow survivors of Jammeh\u2019s bogus AIDS treatment are doing what once seemed impossible \u2013 speaking out about their suffering and pursuing justice against the man who endangered their lives.\u000aAn estimated 9,000 Gambians, most with HIV, passed through Jammeh\u2019s treatment programs and were forced to give up conventional medicine in favor of his homemade cures, said AIDS-Free World, a U.S.-based charity working with survivors.\u000aThe fake AIDS treatment not only had grave health consequences for the patients, some of whom died, but hindered real HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in the country, UNAIDS said.\u000a\u201cThere was sort of a blackout of information on HIV, because everything was related to the president\u2019s treatment,\u201d said the U.N. agency\u2019s country director Sirra Ndow.\u000a\u201cThere was the perception that if there was a cure, you didn\u2019t need support.\u201d\u000aAlthough HIV death rates are falling and treatment rates rising globally, Gambia is trailing.\u000aIts infection rate \u2013 of about two percent \u2013 is much lower than many African countries. But only 30 percent of Gambians with HIV were on antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in 2016, while the target is 90 percent by 2020, according to UNAIDS.\u000aTHE GLASS HOUSE\u000aSowe and two other outspoken survivors, Fatou Jatta and Lamin Ceesay, are working with lawyers and activists to gather evidence against Jammeh.\u000aBut all three are in their 50s or 60s and struggling with poor health, discrimination and poverty.\u000a\u201cWe believe they should be compensated, but time is really against us,\u201d said Agasha Tabaro, a legal fellow with AIDS-Free World. \u201cThis is a health issue, and it\u2019s urgent.\u201d\u000aThe patients never knew what Jammeh was feeding them.\u000aSometimes it came in a bottle, sometimes powdered, sometimes mixed with canned milk or honey. If they sipped the concoctions, he would yell, forcing them to drink it all at once, they said.\u000a\u201cI would vomit every time,\u201d said Jatta, 51, a social worker who spent nine months in the program after publicly disclosing that she had HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\u000aEvery day, Jammeh\u2019s patients were taken to a glass building in the state house complex where the president administered the treatment, they said. They were not allowed to contact their families, or allowed to opt out.\u000aSometimes the president would rub ointments on their bodies. The sessions were filmed and broadcast on state television.\u000a\u201cThe psychological effect on me was such that after the program I felt it very difficult to integrate again into society,\u201d said Sowe.\u000aSeverely weakened by Jammeh\u2019s treatment, Sowe and Ceesay went back on ARVs after Jammeh discharged them, and Jatta started taking them. Ceesay\u2019s wife, also in the program, died.\u000aAfter Jammeh\u2019s treatment program, survivors lost their jobs and struggled to feed their families, they said. They could not escape the fact that their faces had been broadcast on TV.\u000a\u201cI think their dignity needs to be restored,\u201d said Ndow.\u000aCeesay, who was the first man in Gambia to openly declare his status, said he has been forced to move houses frequently because landlords evict him when they find out he has HIV.\u000a\u201cI want my own home for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2018m struggling with now.\u201d\u000aFIGHT FOR JUSTICE\u000aThe survivors know that bringing Jammeh to justice may be a far-flung hope. He fled to Equatorial Guinea and it is unclear whether President Teodoro Obiang would extradite him.\u000aA truth and reconciliation commission is expected to start work in Gambia later this year.\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy to get Jammeh to trial, but it can certainly be done,\u201d said Reed Brody, a U.S. lawyer steering the campaign for victims of alleged rights abuses under Jammeh.\u000a\u201cAs the victims tell their stories and more and more information comes out, the demand for justice could become overwhelming,\u201d he said.\u000aBrody, nicknamed the \u201cdictator hunter\u201d, helped victims of Chad\u2019s Hissene Habre jail their former president for life last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u000aBut it was a 17-year battle.\u000a\u201cEven if the compensation comes when we are not here, it will be for our children,\u201d Jatta said.

V Ral Fernandez \u000a Lives in Auckland, New Zealand \u000a19w ago\u000aI don\u2019t think there are any countries on earth without a bible. The two countries that have been listed by other answerers are North Korea and Saudi Arabia (the list by Gideons International don\u2019t ban bibles, they just ban the organisation).\u000aSaudi Arabia certainly bans churches but you are allowed to bring in a Bible for personal use (as a christian expatriate). But non christians are not allowed one (including Saudi citizens).\u000aI\u2019m not too sure on the exact laws in North Korea, but I do know that the government says there is freedom of religion, but in reality religion is suppressed, being North Korea and all. Also I do know that because Kim Jong Il visited Russia and liked it he decided to build a Russian Orthodox church in Pyongyang, even sending some North Koreans to Russia to be trained to become priests. This seems more like a vanity project than any kind of actual freedom of religion, as this isn\u2019t a thing in the hermit kingdom.\u000a John Fahlsing \u000a former Retired at Half Way House (1991-2015) \u000a19w ago\u000a Geoff Cutler \u000a Christian spiritualist and author of spiritual books. \u000a19w ago\u000aIf people remained conscious after death but were anchored to their body, would it still be possible to feel pain?\u000aActually this has happened. The separation of the silver chord is supposed to occur rapidly on death, and in fact it is what defines death of the body, from a spiritual perspective. In the case I came across, the individual actually experienced his own funeral, albeit not as we would because he was in the spiritual realm, but still attached and unable to move to his proper spirit location. No pain at all can be felt. This is basically the same as many reports of going out of body when dreadful injuries of the body occur. Only if the person returns, and becomes conscious again, can they feel pain.\u000a

V Kilanko Paul \u000a Here for the Coffee \u000a12w ago\u000aAmir Abdulazeez \u2018s answer puts it perfectly, hardly a way I can out do that, but I will attempt to elucidate on them in four salient points.\u000aLack of a united front\u000aEither MASSOB or IPOB fail to offer a united front with which to present their case in a way deemed legal, within the constitution of the country. Inciting hate and violence, which essentially rally a hostile situation, through a a radio station in London is hardly a decent direction for a potential neighbour.\u000aThe recent Catalan referendum is such a prime example of one path which Eastern Nigeria would have pressured the government to act. By conducting a howbeit, illegal vote count, they would have effectively placed a number on the amount wanting separation.\u000aBut until the IPOB provides, that majority indeed wants separation The Government\u2019s stance would still remains; they are viewed as a rebels to the peace of the country.\u000aAmbiguity of claim\u000aThe Biafran prospective state line worries everyone. The last attempt at Independence had most of the now South-South part of the country lumped together as Eastern Region. But recently, that water has become a little more murky.\u000aThe bulk of the then Eastern Region have followed through with an organic partitioning , to create more states for minorities and ethnic groups \u2014 not too dissimilar from the Igbos. These parts, The now new separatists still claims even with explicit rejection frm those regions.\u000aThe Nigerian Government is hardly going to hand over the oil rich regions and it\u2019s non agreeing citizens anytime soon ( although they did that with Bakassi but that is for another day ) a situation which IPOD has little plan over.\u000apre civil war Biafra.\u000aThe present situation with Biafra in Red\u000aThis leaves Biafra effectively landlocked country \u2014- if granted independent\u2014 and an enclave within the Nigerian state. A prospect most Igbo elites aren\u2019t too delighted to carry on with, given that they could be denied the greater market of Nigeria and bottled with levies and import duties they have enjoyed as part of the Nigeria state.\u000aThe Biafra war and men who fought it\u000aThe vanguard of the winning Nigeria side in the Biafran war, transitioned into government with some now controlling the country in one faction or another. Given that they were around to receive the then surrender of the breakaway region and the Vice president of Biafra in his speech[1] declared that Biafra ceases to exist. They \u2014 the former generals and now government\u2014 view the current agitation with disdain, and as a sign of betrayal.\u000aEven more so, the exiled leader of Biafra Dr Ojukwu was pardoned on the grounds of those terms, even allowed to compete in the presidential election of the country in a bit to smooth thing over.\u000aLimited understanding of the geopolitical situation\u000aNigeria is a power struggle between the Southern and Northern protectorates (colonial terms) . The South subdivides into Eastern and Western region with the Niger delta, a cacophony of smaller ethnicities groups as south south.\u000aThe North partitions into, Core North, with the middle belt as another area with large minority. But any true Nigeria would tell you, the real power lies with the major ethnic groups which the Igbo is part.\u000aInstead of a dual power structure, Nigeria is essentially a Triumvirate between Yoruba, Hausa ( sometimes lumped with Fulani) and Igbo with other groups stacking neatly behind.\u000aTo gain any significant traction, they have to appeal with the other major groups with reasons to support their independence which the Igbo are yet to accomplish.\u000aThen again there is the old nemesis precedence. Nigeria isn\u2019t currently the happiest place , and The Government, guessing correctly understands that handling Biafara a hall pass would end Nigeria as a state and institution.\u000aOther regions would want to follow suit. And this would be a disaster. It would break the country into small states, demolish the relevance of the country on the continent, and open a chance at going again at each other in a bid to settling old scores during the civil war. This, nobody wants.\u000aFootnotes\u000a Amir Abdulazeez \u000a Geographer by education; Teacher by profession; Writer by passion. \u000a14w ago\u000aOne, no one gives you independence or allows you to secede just like that. You will have to work diligently for it. No Nigerian President even if he is Igbo will want to enter the history books as one who supervised the break up of Nigeria.\u000aTwo, there isn't the right approach and organization yet. First Ojukwu wanted to achieve it by force under military rule; now others want to achieve it through sentiments under a democracy. There isn't a well worked out plan for its actualization.\u000aThree, the struggle isn't consistent. While there are cases when it looks like a genuine struggle, there are many others when it looks like a politico-sentimental propaganda. The struggle is more emotional than ideological. Its agigatators mostly intensify the struggle when the political equation in the country doesn't favour their interests.\u000aFour, we don't even know what constitutes Biafra. Is it the South East or the SE and South South included? There is no strong leadership and coordination behind the whole project. Even to collectively support APGA, an Igbo party, is a problem. How can you create a country?\u000aFive, it doesn't enjoy the active support of the Igbo elites that matter politically and economically. Governors, Senators, Business men, etc from Igbo land appear not to give a damn about it, at least not openly.\u000a Emmanuel-Francis Nwaolisa Ogomegbunam \u000a Observer of Political Trends \u000a28w ago\u000aStates aren\u2019t allowed, they become independent. I just answered a question I found funny. My good mood means I\u2019ll skip the usual detraction of your cause, try to be constructive.\u000aA state only exists if it is sovereign, that is, its government, foreign policy, military and occasionally economic policy are free from foreign interference. The states claimed by Biafra are not. This means that it is not independent.\u000aTo bring a state into existence, the parameters for sovereignty must be met, and defended. That done, declare the state and wait for international recognition.\u000a

VFrank Lampard fears for former club Chelsea over their inability to compete in the transfer market.\u000aAnd he is concerned that stars such as Eden Hazard could soon get itchy feet if the club are unable to maintain their impeccable standards.\u000aLampard, regarded by many as the greatest player in Chelsea's history during his 13 years at the club, told The Sun: \u201cCity and United have blown everyone else out of the water in terms of their spending in the last two years.\u000a\u201cChelsea have the power to match them but it's something they haven't particularly done in recent years.\u000a\u201cDon't get me wrong, they've spent good money. It's not as if they've suddenly stopped buying players.\u000a\u201cBut other clubs are spending more and they have to be careful not to get left behind.\u000a\u201cThe manager isn't happy and he obviously feels his squad is a bit thin to battle on so many different fronts.\u000a\u201cAnd I think he's been proved correct to a degree because when you win the title and then lose big players like Costa and Matic, you have to recruit to move forward because everyone else is doing that.\u000a\u201cAntonio Conte certainly seems frustrated. He doesn't mince his words and he's been pretty honest about how he feels.\u000a\u201cHe wanted to add to the squad and he speaks about how it's not his business as to who gets signed.\u000a\u201cI don't know where things are headed long-term but I think the club and manager will need to sit down in the summer to sort things out."\u000a

VFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson saoid the Red Devils scouted Alexis Sanchez back in 2010\u000aFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson\u000aAlexis Sanchez is widely regarded as one of the Premier League\u2019s top attacking players as he prepares for life at Manchester United in the wake of his transfer from Arsenal.\u000aSanchez signed for the Gunners from Barcelona back in the summer of 2014 and has earned huge amounts of praise for his performances for the north London side.\u000aThe 29-year-old is now heading to Old Trafford as part of the deal which will see Henrikh Mkhitaryan head to Arsenal.\u000aSanchez has been playing his football in Europe since signing for Udinese from Chilean side Cobreloa back in 2006, and he joined Barcelona back in 2011.\u000aFerguson was in charge of Manchester United until the summer of 2013 and he had some glowing words of praise for Sanchez before his move to Barcelona was confirmed in 2011.\u000aAccording to the Daily Express, Ferguson said in 2010: \u201cWe have looked at Sanchez and he has impressed us, as have other players. He has had very good games and is an interesting project.\u000a\u201cWe have gathered some background, as with other footballers at his level, but nothing more than this for the moment.\u000a\u201cWe have watched some Chileans in the past. The most interesting case was that of Salas, who had a brilliant World Cup [at France \u201998] but he was at Lazio.\u000a\u201cWe would have liked to have had him.\u201d\u000aManchester United are currently preparing for their fourth-round FA Cup clash against Yeovil Town on Friday night.\u000aThe Red Devils made it back to back wins in the Premier League on Saturday with a 1-0 victory over Burnley.\u000aJose Mourinho\u2019s men are currently in second place in the Premier League table and 12 points behind leaders Manchester City after 24 games this season.\u000a

VThe Prince Adedayo Adeyeye Movement (PAAM), has accused Governor Ayodele Fayose and his cronies of allegedly ordering some electronic media in Ekiti State to blacklist its campaigns due to personal animosity.\u000aPAAM, is the political platform of the former Minister of Works, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, who is gunning for the governorship seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\u000aThe adoption of the Deputy Governor, Prof. Kolapo Olusola as the PDP\u2019s sole candidate for the July 14 election, had pitted Adeyeye against a section of the party loyal to Fayose.\u000aA statement signed by the PAAM\u2019s Director of Media and Publicity, Chief Niyi Ojo, described as too belittling and appalling, series of alleged text messages being sent to some journalists in Ekiti against covering Adeyeye\u2019s campaign on the premise that they were on retainership with the government.\u000aThe statement averred that journalists were daily being harassed by government\u2019s agents for being fair to the opposition, saying no amount of desperation and coercion will make Fayose succeeds in his bid to unleash his surrogate on the state.\u000aOjo said: \u201cThe attention of Prince Adedayo Adeyeye Movement (PAAM) has been drawn to a text message from Lere Olayinka, the Special Assistant to Governor Fayose on Public Communication to some electronic media not to cover the declaration for Governorship rally of Prince Adeyeye.\u201d\u000aHe quoted the text as: \u201cThe Governor is opposed to you going to cover opposition functions particularly, Adeyeye and co\u201d.\u000aHe added, \u201cIt should be noted that the retainership these stations have with Ekiti State Government is serviced with Ekiti tax payers\u2019 money not from the private pocket of Ayo Fayose.\u000a\u201cMoreover, it is the highest level of executive lawlessness for a Governor to term a member of his own party \u201copposition\u201d simply because of dissenting opinions as to how the the new candidate of the party will emerge.\u000a\u201cOne does not need a soothsayer to conclude that the desperation of Fayose to pick a successor is fast becoming a comic show eliciting laughter from all stakeholders. The media houses are enjoin to live up to their responsibilities of unbiased and balance reportage in the interest of Ekiti State in particular and Nigeria generally\u201d.\u000a

VOn July 26, 2017, Jordan Dinsmore arrived at her apartment complex after working her shift at the local restaurant.\u000aAs the 20-year-old University of South Carolina student got out of her car, three men suddenly appeared and pointed a gun at her.\u000aJordan began screaming, but the men threatened to shoot her. They forced her into the backseat of her 2009 Scion as they attempted to drive to the ATM so they could rob her.\u000aBut Jordan\u2019s vehicle was a stick shift and her abductors didn\u2019t know how to operate it.\u000aThe armed men made Jordan get in the driver\u2019s seat. She went to the nearby ATM and withdrew $300. During the ride, she overheard one of the men talking about sexually assaulting her at his \u201cauntie\u2019s\u201d house.\u000aFrantic and terrified, Jordan thought of her mom, Beth Turner, who once had a similar terrifying experience. Beth was almost sexually assaulted in college but she fought the man off and escaped.\u000aBeth taught Jordan to never let an attacker take her to a second location; that\u2019s typically where the threat becomes more serious.\u000aI\u2019m going to be strong like my mom, Jordan thought to herself. I\u2019m going to get myself out of this.\u000aRemembering her mom\u2019s advice, Jordan left her seatbelt unbuckled when she got back into the car. She waited for the right opportunity, threw her car into neutral, opened the driver\u2019s side door and leapt out at 30-40 miles per hour.\u000aSince her kidnappers couldn\u2019t figure out how to drive her car, they fled.\u000aIn the video below, listen to the 911 call made after the insanely brave college student escaped her abductors.\u000a

V Nicolo Robba \u000a CEO at Superble (2017-present) \u000aIf you want to keep your face free from outbreaks, there\u2019s a very simple routine which you can follow every day and will make wonders!\u000aThis is no surprise or magic treatment. I didn\u2019t get the information from a weird looking and acting sales person knocking at my door!\u000aIt\u2019s just the fruit of many studies from trusted skincare experts who give their best when they list down simple activities to follow day and night. Beauty bloggers, nutritionists and other experts have been using these tips for like\u2026. ever!\u000aAnd their skin has never looked much brighter and flawless :) So, keep reading and let me know!\u000aHere are the tips from skincare experts on Superble:\u000aDr. Doris Day, a leading dermatologist in cosmetic dermatology[1] says that hydration is key to clear skin. Dehydration causes breakouts, because the skin overcompensates and produces more oil than necessary when it\u2019s dry, which in turn causes you to break out.\u000aDon\u2019t leave your makeup on overnight. Keep makeup remover wipes at your bedside table to avoid acne in the morning.\u000aExercise for about 15 minutes a day is important to staying healthy and keeping your skin clear, as well as toxins in your body at bay.\u000aLearn which skin type you have and you will also learn how to treat it. Whether it\u2019s dry, normal, oily or combination, there\u2019s a specific type of product you should be looking for that will work best for you.\u000aYour mobile phone contains more bacteria than a toilet seat! Use antibacterial wipes to clean your phone and use a speakerphone or your headphones as much as possible.\u000aAnother medical doctor and a Specialist Dermatologist, Dr Stefanie William[2]; mentioned that one should cut back on fast food or anything fried. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice in favor of water.\u000aAnd if you are looking for specific products, I came up with another list of the ones I have been recommended from my beloved experts on Superble.\u000aCentella Blemish Cream: This product is absolutely amazing for curing acne and cysts. It is an effective acne treatment cream, clearing the skin, leaving your face to be smooth and soft.\u000aBody Shop\u2019s Tea-Tree Oil: This product works wonders on acne troubled skin! It helps cure acne as well as blemishes, preventing/reducing acne from breaking\u000aJeju Volcanic Clay Face Masks: This product is pretty impressive. This skin reduces the oil on oily skin. Not only that by applying the mask on the blemishes will helped to dry out those troubled spots faster\u000aYou can find other skincare products recommendations here: Breakout Woes My Favourite Products For Acne\u000aSources:\u000a Swati Malhotra \u000a Medical Student & Keen learner \u000aJan 18\u000aIf you are looking for the quickest way to reduce acne scars then your search ends here. Acne scars cannot be treated only with medicines. Laser acne scar treatment is the best treatment to reduce acne scars permanently.\u000aThe acne scars laser treatment involves the technique of laser resurfacing. Laser resurfacing procedure not only treats acne scars perfectly but also gives you a glowing and younger looking skin.\u000aWhat is Laser Resurfacing?\u000aThe laser resurfacing acne scars treatment involves an intense beam of light which is passed over the various skin layers. The passing of this powerful beam of light results in stimulation of new skin cells. Also, the epidermis (outermost skin layer) containing acne scars is damaged through this beam of light. Hence, the patient gets an acne scar-free skin which is glowing and much more attractive than before.\u000aAt Jaipur Skincity wide range of therapies including chemical peeling, dermaroller, microdermabrasion and acupulseCO2 laser are available. Treatment is tailored according to individual need.\u000aSkin is the most evident part of our body and thus, I do not want it get on the wrong hands.

Apart from the methods that you have tried, fortunately, there are certain latest cosmetic treatments which include various surgical and non-surgical procedures that can effectively treat the acne scars.\u000aHere are some of these non-surgical treatments:\u000aIt is a procedure in which laser energy is used to improve the appearance of your skin.\u000aThis procedure involves removing the top layer of skin with which surface acne scars completely removed and deep acne scars appear less noticeable.\u000a\u2022 Chemical Peels:\u000aThe top layer of the skin is removed by using different chemicals which are applied according to the severity of acne scars such as mild, medium and deep scars.\u000a\u2022 Intense Pulsed Light & Radiofrequency:\u000aBoth these procedures involve light waves and radio waves that help makes scars less noticeable without damaging the outer layer of the skin.\u000aThe surgical treatment includes:\u000a\u2022 Surgical removal or treatment:\u000aThis option is used to treat deeper scars depending on your particular condition. It includes procedures such as skin grafts and excision.\u000aA board certified cosmetic surgeon or plastic surgeon at Laser Klinic in NYC can better help you to determine which treatment option is best suitable for you according to the condition of your acne scars.\u000a Pooja Bhardwaj \u000a Onwer/Founder at amazingmy.com , Researcher \u000aMay 9\u000aHello dear\u000aFor your chornic acne , you must try products that contains Salicylic Acid. Salicylic Acid is one of the biggest enemy for acne & scars . It\u2019s really effective , only con is that it can makes you skin dry as well.\u000aYou can read about here :- Salicylic Acid:- A Treatment For Acne And Dandruff\u000aFor acne , you can try these 2 face washes as these are really effective to treat acne and i tried it myself during my fungal infection :-\u000aFirst one is \u201c\u2018Acmed Face Wash\u201d . It\u2019s recommended by many dermatologists to treat acne & pimples . It also works for sure and only con is that it can make your skin dry as well.\u000aSecond one is \u201c Mentholatum Acnes Face Wash\u201d. It\u2019s paraben free and safe for all of us. It\u2019s my regular fav face wash. It\u2019s really works for sure and helps to cure & prevent acne & pimples. Best thing is that it\u2019s suitable for all skin types .Acnes Face Wash Review | Be Beautiful And Healthy!\u000aNow For dark spots and scars , you can try these products :-\u000aOf course internal health comes first , then you must Eat products that contains Vitamin C, E and K. They are extremely good for our skin.\u000aEat fruits like KIwi, papaya, guava , water melon etc. -Top 10 fruits For glowing skin\u000aRemove Acne Scars With Natural Remedies \u2026\u000aTry these natural remedies first before the more drastic \u2013 and expensive \u2013 treatments below. Yes, they take longer, but they also build your health, rather than damaging it.\u000aAcne Scar Treatment #1: Vitamin E is a very popular and famous remedy for scars of every kind. If you want to maximize this remedy, go internal AND external. That is, take natural (not synthetic, which is a waste of your time and money!) Vitamin E every day and also apply it externally to your scars. Simply squeeze some of the oil out of a capsule. You can buy bottles of pure Vitamin E oil, but the oil in the capsules is more likely to be potent since it isn't constantly exposed to the air as it is in the bottle.\u000aAcne Scar Treatment #2: Make a paste of sandalwood and rose water and apply to your scars. Just as above, the synthetic versions will do you no good at all.\u000aAcne Scar Treatment #3: A famous anti-aging oil for the skin is rosehip seed oil and it also combats scars in many people. Like the Vitamin E, choose only natural oil and apply it as often as possible to your scars. Rosehip seed oil also is well known as a wrinkle fighter.\u000aAcne Scar Treatment #4: For maximum benefits, it's important to combat your acne scars from the inside, as well as the outside, so be certain to drink lots and lots of water [not unfiltered tap water!]. The optimal amount is 1/2 ounce for every pound of body weight, spread out over the day.\u000aImportant note: tea, coffee, soft drinks, alcohol and other such beverages are all dehydrating. If you drink them, (and you probably will \u2013 I know I do!) you will need extra water to counteract their effects. Generally, it takes twice as much water to make up for the effects. That is, if you drink 8 ounces of coke, drink 16 extra ounces of water, beyond your normal amount.\u000aThere is nothing you can do for your skin that is as powerful as drinking lots of GOOD water!\u000aDrinking lots of good water will also help to combat acne while it's occurring as well as reduce the likelihood of scarring.\u000aAcne Scar Treatment #5: Eating foods that promote health will also help to battle acne while it's occurring, reduce the chances of scars and help eliminate scarring once it has occurred. Think about it \u2026 the health of any body is 100% dependent on the health of its individual cells. And those cells are about as healthy as the fuel they receive.\u000aTake care :)\u000a

VGetty Images\u000aFrank Lampard has backed Chelsea\u2019s move for Edin Dzeko and believes that he offers the \u201csomething different\u201d that the Blues need.\u000aAntonio Conte has regularly bemoaned an inability to get top targets through the door at Stamford Bridge.\u000aFurther reinforcements are still required, having lost the title-winning experience of Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic, with the London club currently in talks with Dzeko.\u000aLampard feels the former Manchester City star would be a shrewd addition, with the Bosnia international a better fit for a club of Chelsea\u2019s stature than other mooted targets such as West Ham\u2019s Andy Carroll and Stoke City\u2019s Peter Crouch.\u000aThe Blues legend told the Evening Standard: \u201cCarroll and Crouch are not the kind of names Chelsea have gone for in the past.\u000a\u201cBut January is a tough one and [Alexis] Sanchez is a one-off. The majority of the time you\u2019re looking at making minor adjustments.\u000a\u201cIf it\u2019s a Crouch or Carroll, it\u2019s just a back-up but Dzeko is something different. He is a very good player, an all-round striker with all the attributes.\u000a\u201cIn terms of investing heavily, that will come in the summer. It\u2019s very easy to say that Crouch and Carroll are not Chelsea signings but it\u2019s not an indication of where Chelsea are going.\u000a\u201cIt is more a sign that the manager doesn\u2019t think they strengthened enough last summer.\u201d\u000aChelsea are currently third in the Premier League standings while also readying themselves for an FA Cup fourth round clash with Newcastle and a heavyweight last-16 encounter with Barcelona in the Champions League.\u000aThere is, therefore, still all to play for, with Lampard convinced that a testing season can end on a high.\u000aHe said: \u201cThis is when the experienced players are vital \u2013 there is nothing wrong with getting everyone together and reminding everyone to push.\u000a\u201cChelsea do need to get their act together. They have the spirit there. They have the players.\u000a\u201cWhen Chelsea get it right, as we saw last season, they can take on anybody. It is certainly not the time to give up.\u201d\u000aGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook\u000aAD: To get thousands of free final year project topics and materials sorted by subject to help with your research [click here]\u000aAD: Warning to Men: Three foods you must avoid, if you want stronger erection & last up to 28 minutes during sex [Click for info]\u000a

VThink Chivalry is dead? Then so are your chances of impressing your boss or your girl at dinner. These ten simple tips take you from the car to the exit sign, without losing your date, your job, or your cool. \u000aCongrats on your awesome new job. Even though you just started, you are about to get your first raise. Now your boss wants to take you out for dinner. No, you\u2019re not sleeping your way to the top, this is strictly business, with your boss and an important client. However, you need to look and act the part, and there are a few things you should know before you even sit down.\u000a For that matter, you\u2019re also planning to go out with your girlfriend\u2019s parents this week. They\u2019re taking you to some fancy place with metal forks and cloth napkins. You borrowed your roommate\u2019s jacket, but you\u2019re a little nervous you might do the wrong thing.\u000a Have no fear. All these questions and more will be answered in our exclusive, one-of-a-kind insider\u2019s guide:\u000aA Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Dinner Manners\u000aBy Jesse Stern\u000aYou are about to enter an exclusive inner circle. But before we get down to business, this guide applies to pretty much any situation where you\u2019re eating food in public. Dates, business lunches, dinners, meeting the parents, and so on. These ten simple tips take you from the car to the exit sign, without losing your date, your job, or your cool.\u000a Most dates appreciate chivalry. Most older women also enjoy it. But sometimes people get offended, particularly in corporate culture. When should you use it, when not? Here is a general rule that will help you wade through the treacherous waters of chivalry. It\u2019s called The Handsome Rule.\u000a If you\u2019re with a date, or with any female who might refer to you as \u201chandsome,\u201d do it. If you\u2019re with anyone, whom you might refer to as \u201chandsome,\u201d don\u2019t do it.\u000a1. The Car Door\u000aThe first step is the car door. When you\u2019re on a date, it\u2019s charming and gentlemanly to open the car door for her. It has an old-school, James Bond vibe to it (Sean Connery, not Daniel Craig).\u000aWhat about other times?\u000aHer: An excellent first example of the Handsome rule. Open the car door for her if she\u2019s your date, your girlfriend\u2019s mother, or any female who might refer to you as \u201chandsome\u201d. If she\u2019s your boss or your coworker, it\u2019s probably best to let her fend for herself, unless of course you want to flirt.\u000aTip: don\u2019t flirt with your boss or coworker.\u000aHim: Don\u2019t ever open the car door for a guy unless you\u2019re a limo driver, a valet wearing white gloves, or a rescue worker and his car is on fire.\u000a2. The Sidewalk\u000aIf she is wearing fancy clothes, or is at least old enough to have given birth to you, offer an arm. In the old days, when accompanying a woman, the man walked on the outside (street side), to prevent mud from splashing on her clothes. In modern times, the man walks on the outside to offer protection against would-be assailants lurking between parked cars. In even more modern times, and in dense urban areas, men sometimes walk on the inside, to protect against would-be attackers lurking in doorways. In general, when walking with a woman, you should walk on the outside \u2014 unless you are legitimately concerned about muggers lurking in doorways. \u000aThe sidewalk is a pretty harmless bit of chivalry. Even the most jaded, Doc-Marten-and-flannel-shirt-wearing feminist usually finds this act of courtesy quaint and charming. Most women notice and appreciate it, and you don\u2019t have to make a big deal of it. Just get in the habit.\u000aSwitching: You might sometimes have to switch sides to stay on the outside, such as when crossing streets. This is normal, as long as you don\u2019t make a big deal of it. Try to do it super cool, without her noticing. Also think of the situation you\u2019re in, and ease up if it draws attention.\u000a3. The Door\u000aHolding a door open for someone can make you appear suave, or it can make you look like a douchebag. In professional settings, it\u2019s considered polite to open the door for anyone, male or female, and let them through first. On a date, it\u2019s pure sex appeal. \u000aHer: On a date, open the door for her. This will be easiest if you\u2019re on the hinges side of the door. Otherwise, your arm gets in the way. If you can switch ninja-style, before getting to the door, do it.\u000aHim: It is so Alpha Male that he will be intimidated and unmanned by this simple act of kindness. The best way to handle this is to go through, then hold the door open, allowing him to follow. He will then nod submissively, and may mumble \u201cthanks.\u201d It\u2019s also okay to hold the door for a guy if he\u2019s your friend, and you happen to be on the hinges side of the door.\u000aSame trick with crowds. You are obviously not going to stand there for hours, but at least hold on long enough for the next person or two to get through without the door slamming in their face. Wait until someone \u201chandsome\u201d approaches, then let go.\u000a4. The Coat\u000aHer: On a date, especially if it\u2019s formal or dressy, take her coat. Stand behind her and help her take it off, then hang it up for her. This is a super smooth thing to do on a date. Use the Handsome Rule in other situations. In business, don\u2019t take anyone\u2019s coat, unless they are at your house.\u000aRemember, if you\u2019re in a situation causing you to dress up more than normal, your everyday manners need dressed up as well. Taking a woman\u2019s coat may seem awkward and unnatural but that\u2019s only because you\u2019re not in formal settings everyday. If your clothes are formal, your manners should be too.\u000aHim: Don\u2019t ever take a guy\u2019s coat. Awkward.\u000a5. The Chair\u000aDon\u2019t sit down yet, Romeo. Stand behind her chair and pull it out. When she sits down, help her push the chair in closer to the table. Then you can sit down. On a date, cool. Business, not cool.\u000aAn older female who might call you \u201chandsome\u201d will be surprised that you are so cultured. She will smile (in the same way that she might smile when looking at pictures of George Clooney), and make a comment about what a gentleman you are. Give her a flirtatious wink and get her phone number later. (If she\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s mom, best skip this step.)\u000aPhoto by Amanda\u000a6. The Napkin\u000aI have no idea why, but you should always put your napkin in your lap as soon as you sit down. Especially if it\u2019s a cloth napkin. Especially if you\u2019re trying to impress your boss or girlfriend\u2019s parents. Leave it in your lap until you\u2019re done eating.\u000aIf your napkin falls on the floor, don\u2019t pick it up \u2014 ask for another one. Same if you drop a fork, spoon, knife, bit of food, toy dinosaur, menu, or chocolate mint. No three-second rule here. \u000aHandsome or not, what lands on the floor \u2026 stays on the floor!\u000a7. The Food\u000aPeople have written entire books on polite eating etiquette. When you\u2019re ready to have dinner with the President, go buy one. Until then, here are a few tips to get you through the meal.\u000aWhich fork: If you have more than one fork, this usually means you have more than one \u201ccourse\u201d or plate of food. Just remember to start on the outside and work in. Use the outside fork and leave it on your plate when you\u2019re done.\u000aSave your knife. Small forks are for salad, big forks are for dinner. Tiny forks north of the plate are for seafood. Big spoons are for soup, and for some reason you\u2019re supposed to spoon the soup away from you. Tiny spoons are for coffee.\u000aWhile eating, just remember the stuff Grandma used to tell you:\u000aElbows off the table\u000aSit up straight\u000aCut your food into small bites\u000aChew with your mouth closed\u000aSwallow before talking\u000aTake your time eating\u000aAlso:\u000aDon\u2019t slurp or stir things, especially spaghetti. You should always twist your spaghetti onto your fork by placing the end of the fork on a spoon. Never twist right on the plate.\u000aBe aware of your companions\u2019 cultural and personal eating habits. If they are vegetarian, or if they don\u2019t eat pork, forgo the cutlet.\u000aDon\u2019t scrunch up your face and ask \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d, especially in ethnic restaurants.\u000aThere is also more subtle stuff. Like when you put your knife and fork down, put them on the plate, not touching the table. Or when you butter bread, put some butter on your plate, then use the butter from your plate to butter the bread. Let\u2019s not worry about that stuff for now. Just try not to drop anything in your lap.\u000a Nothing says \u201cBond, James Bond\u201d like a secret code. At really nice restaurants, there\u2019s a cool little code to tell the waiter when you\u2019re done eating. Put the knife and fork together on your plate at either 4 or 8 o-clock. If you\u2019re still eating, separate the knife and fork on your plate at 4 and 8 o-clock. No one will notice this, unless you\u2019re at a fancy restaurant, but if they do, they will recognize you as a man of distinction. \u000a8. The Booze\u000aBusiness: Order alcohol only if the person you\u2019re trying to impress is drinking. At lunch, limit yourself to one drink, no matter how much anyone else drinks. At dinner, have two.\u000aDate: Whoever is driving should have only one.\u000aSocial: Unless you\u2019re with buddies, treat it like business \u2014 drink only if the people you\u2019re with are drinking. If you are a recovering alcoholic, or with your AA sponsor, don\u2019t drink.\u000a Tip: These guidelines are for the US only. If you are visiting a different country, everyone in the room can drink you under the table \u2014 even small children \u2014 so just do your best to keep up. \u000a9. The Bill\u000aWhen it\u2019s time to go, ask for the check (if you\u2019re planning to pay). If someone else is paying, don\u2019t ask for, touch, look at, or think about the check. Don\u2019t even peek.\u000aIn a business setting, generally whoever invites pays for the meal. If you\u2019re having dinner with the boss, the boss will probably pay. Buddies or coworkers should probably expect to split the check.\u000aIf you\u2019re having dinner with the girlfriend\u2019s parents, here\u2019s what you do: when the check comes, get your wallet out and fumble for a credit card. The parents will then say, \u201coh no, we\u2019ll get this.\u201d Argue feebly. When they insist, put away your wallet. Offer to leave a tip. In the US, the tip is normally $1.50 for every $10 on the bill. Other countries vary on whether and how much to tip. If you\u2019re not sure, ask \u2014 preferably someone besides your waiter.\u000aOn a date, it\u2019s tricky. Most modern women want the freedom of going dutch on a date, with no further obligation. Some, however, expect to be treated like a queen. As a general rule, the fancier her clothes, the more likely she expects you to pay for dinner. If she orders the most expensive thing on the menu, she probably expects you to pay. In any case, bring enough that you can pay for the whole thing. Does this mean you will get anywhere with her later? That depends on you, superstar.\u000aWe\u2019ve all seen it. You\u2019re out having dinner with your buddies, and somebody gets up right before dessert. He says, \u201cI gotta run.\u201d There are lots of laughs, high fives, and see you laters. After he\u2019s gone, you realize the high fives were a smokescreen. He left without paying. Not cool. Equally lame is when someone puts in a couple of wrinkled Washingtons and a handful of pennies, while someone else pays double.\u000aBe cool when chipping in for the meal, and cover what you ate. Get in the habit of carrying cash around, especially if you know you\u2019re going out. There\u2019s nothing worse than when you have to ask to split a card\u2013you\u2019re an adult man now, come prepared to pay for what you ordered.\u000a10. The Exit Strategy\u000aOn a date, get her coat, help her with the sleeves, hold the door (hinges on your side), walk on the outside on the sidewalk, go back to the car, open it for her, wait for her to get in, close it, go around to your side, hop in, smile like an after-shave model, and you\u2019re ready to rock.\u000aTip of the Week: Can You Hear Me Now?\u000aMost of us get annoyed by people who talk on the phone in close public places. But for some reason, this doesn\u2019t seem to apply to us when we get a call or text. Talking or texting at restaurants, movies, weddings, funerals, etc., is extremely rude \u2014 yes, even when you do it. It\u2019s rude to the people around you, and it\u2019s rude to the people you\u2019re with. When you interrupt a conversation to take a call, you\u2019re basically saying \u201cmy phone is more important than this face-to-face conversation I\u2019m having with you\u201d.\u000aTurn off your ringer, even at a restaurant but especially at movies, weddings and funerals. If you absolutely must take a call, excuse yourself and leave the room. Whenever on the phone in public, use your \u201cinside voice,\u201d and avoid talking like an Irish Dockworker. (I have nothing against Irish Dockworkers. Some of my best friends are Irish Dockworkers. I\u2019m just saying.) On a date or business meal, let the people you\u2019re with know in advance that you are expecting a call. Keep it short, and get back to the face-to-face.\u000a

VOperatives of the Department of State Security Services have been accused of forcing a retired Customs Officer to confess to a crime he didn't commit. \u000aDSS\u000aA retired Assistant Comptroller of Customs, Mahmud Hassan has narrated before a Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday how operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) allegedly chained and threatened him with a gun in bid to force him to confess to a crime.\u000aHis lawyer, Yakubu Galadima, alleged that his client was forced to make a statement at gun point.\u000aHassan was arraigned along with four others before Justice Ayokunle Faji for allegedly importing arms and ammunition, including 661 pump action rifles, without license.\u000aDSS Head of Investigation, Mr. Wale Odu, while testifying on Tuesday, claimed that Hassan confessed to conspiring with others to use his company, Hassan Trading Limited, to import the arms.\u000aBut, Galadima objected to the tendering of Hassan\u2019s statement, saying it was not obtained voluntarily. The judge ordered a trial within trial to determine the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u000aTestifying in the trial within trial on Wednesday, Odu said neither he nor his colleagues forced Hassan to make a statement.\u000a\u201cI was directed to investigate the case and I interacted with the second defendant (Hassan). The interaction was always friendly. We did it under a very conducive atmosphere, in an air-conditioned and well-furnished room.\u000a\u201cWe served him good food. He ate thrice daily, very good and balanced diet. Every medical complaint he had, even headache, was taken care of by our doctors. There was no form of duress, coercion or pointing of gun at the defendant,\u201d he said.\u000aOdu said Hassan explained his and others\u2019 roles in the importation \u201cwithout any form of coercion.\u201d\u000a\u201cAfter the interaction, the second defendant volunteered to reduce our interaction to writing. He was cautioned. The interaction was video recorded,\u201d he added.\u000aWhile cross-examining Odu, Galadima claimed that DSS threatened his client.\u000a\u201cI put it to you that the second defendant was always in chains,\u201d the lawyer told Odu.\u000aThe witness replied: \u201cNo. Our interaction with the witness was always friendly. The issue of being in chain doesn\u2019t arise. Under my supervision, the defendant was never chained.\u201d\u000aGaladima further alleged: \u201cYou threatened to kill the second defendant during the interview.\u201d\u000aOdu also denied the allegation, saying it would be \u201cunprofessional\u201d for him or his men to threaten a suspect with a gun.\u000a\u201cOur investigation is scientific. There\u2019s a process. My interaction with him was without any threat,\u201d he said.\u000aHassan, Oscar Okafor, Donatus Achinulo, Mathew Okoye (at large) and Salihu Danjuma were arraigned on June 14 last year for illegally importing double barrel short guns, pump action rifles and single barrel shot guns (firearms) without authorisation.\u000a

VMarco Procopio \u000a I have a Medical Degree and I am a trained Psychiatrist. \u000a143w ago\u000a It is called linea nigra (latin for black line). It is present in the majority of pregnancies. It is because the placenta produces a hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone that stimulates cells called melanocytes to produce a hormone called melanin, which darkens the skin. The line will disappear gradually after the birth of the baby, over a period of weeks/months.

VFor every foreigner who wants to travel to the UK, including Nigerians and citizens of other commonwealth countries, there are processes you have to go through before you can be given a UK visa. You have to do a lot of work with documents gathering if you really want to visit this country. Let\u2019s figure out the full list of UK visa requirements for Nigerian citizens.\u000aTypes of UK visas for Nigerian citizens\u000aFrom the very beginning, let\u2019s figure out, what types of visas can Nigerian people get in general. Like in most countries, there are short and long-term UK visas. The group of short-term visas includes:\u000aMarriage visa\u000aParent of a Tier 4 child visa\u000aPermitted paid engagement visa\u000aShort-term study visa\u000aStandard visitor visa (This is the visa you will need to apply as a tourist)\u000aIn other cases, you have to get a long-term visa. It could be a diplomatic visa for government of other countries or it could be a student visa, which is issued for up to three years. There are 3 types of student visas:\u000aTier 4 (Child) student visa for students between 4 and 17 years old who want to study in UK schools.\u000aTier 4 (General) student visa for students over 16 years old who want to study in the UK.\u000aShort-term study visa for students who want to study in the UK for less than six months.\u000aAfter you figure out, what type of visa you\u2019re required for your trip goals, it\u2019s time to gather all the necessary documents.\u000aDocuments to apply for UK visa in Nigeria\u000aTo apply for UK visa in Nigeria, you have to collect all the documents, listed below:\u000aECOWAS travel passport.\u000aA latter colored photograph on a white background. It should be 45 mm x 35 mm wide.\u000aIf you are not a Nigerian citizen, you must have a document, which would give you permission to be in this country. Green card, residence permit, and other similar things should do the trick.\u000aInvitation letter.\u000aProof of your financial status.\u000aUK visa form (you can fill it online by visiting the UK official visa page).\u000aCopy of passport page, containing your data information.\u000aIf you are traveling with your spouse, you have to provide the original marriage certificate.\u000aIf you are traveling with your children, you should have originals of the birth certificates.\u000aLatter utility bills.\u000aInformation about flight and hotel bookings.\u000aFor those, whose main travel goal is business, there are some additional documents needed:\u000aFull details of the authorized company representative.\u000aPhysical address.\u000aCompany phone numbers.\u000aAfter you gather all the documents, you have to proceed through the application process.\u000aStages of UK visa application process in Nigeria\u000aThere are 4 steps, which you have to do to apply for UK visa:\u000aStep 1. Fill the online application form. It is not recommended to fill this form yourself. To get an additional consultation, you can visit Teleperformance UK application centers located in Lagos and Abuja. These companies are working with the UK government for immigration and visas. So they can make you sure that you will do everything right.\u000aStep 2. Pay the fee, required for your type of visa. This information, as well as the online form, could be found on official UK visa website. But you have to be careful because after you pay a needed fee, you can\u2019t get your money back, even if in the end your application would be rejected.\u000aStep 3. Book your appointment. After form filling and paying all fees, you will get GWF number, which would be used later. Also, you would be informed about the date of hearing and all required documents via e-mail. As well, you have to register an account on Teleperformance website, otherwise, your request would be denied. With the help of Teleperformance account, you can track the status of your application.\u000aStep 4. Once your date has been fixed, you have to visit UK visa center on the exact date and do not be late, because this could cause more delays and the re-booking of the meeting. You should have your passport, required documents and printed copies of the online visa application form and appointment confirmation with you.\u000aUsually, the procedure of application review takes about 6 days. This could take even longer if you have a crime history. Also, you can apply for the same day service, but in this case, the procedure would cost a lot more.\u000aDon\u2019t forget, that even if you do every stage correctly, your request could still be rejected. Let\u2019s take a look at the main reasons for the rejection.\u000aReasons for refusal\u000aWhen the application review process will be finished, you will receive a letter with the decision on your email. If everything is good, you can pack your bag and go for the new adventure. But if it\u2019s not, there might be something wrong with your documents. So, these are the major reasons for refusal to grant UK visa:\u000aProvision of fraudulent documentation.\u000aLack of funds.\u000aLack of convincing reason for your trip.\u000aLack of valid passport or travel document.\u000aThe discrepancy with the application requirements.\u000aIf the applicant went beyond the allotted time while his previous visit to the UK. \u000aIf the applicant faked his documents while his previous visit to the UK.\u000aIf the applicant received an order of deportation.\u000aIf the applicant was found guilty of a crime that will warrant jail time for four years or more.\u000aIf the applicant hides criminal background.\u000aEach of the above-mentioned reasons could be used against you if you want to apply for UK visa in Nigeria. But you have to remember, that refusal doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t try again. But, in this case, you have to pay your fees again, so before the next try, you have to be sure, that you have eliminated all the shortcomings, which became the reason for previous rejection. \u000aSource: Naija.ng\u000a

VIf you live in Florida, you\u2019re probably accustomed to seeing gators out and about. But it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you\u2019ve seen them wander onto roads or backyards \u2014 perhaps even your own. They\u2019re still quite frightening to encounter in such an up-close-and-personal way.\u000aAfter all, these prehistoric creatures can be quite dangerous to both animals and humans alike! With strong jaws, razor-sharp teeth, and lightning-quick reflexes, they are the perfect hunters.\u000aOne woman living in the Sunshine State knew she had a \u201cneighbor\u201d gator living in the pond close to her home, but she never thought he would come knocking \u2014 literally!\u000aWhen she thought she heard a knock on the back door while she was watching TV one day, she walked over to that part of the house to investigate. And there it was.\u000aThe terrifying gator was staring at her and her cat, staying perfectly still, and sitting dangerously close to the sliding door.\u000aThe brave cat can be heard meowing and attempting to stare down the gator, as if to protect her owner from such a fierce predator.\u000aBut the gator didn\u2019t stalk the woman and her cat for long. The shocked homeowner says that he sat in front of her back door for about five minutes before returning to the pond.\u000aThumbnail Photo: Facebook / Janet Spor Stepanik\u000a
