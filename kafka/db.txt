(Facebook)\nLondon: An Indian-origin teenager has become one of Britain's youngest millionaires after his online estate agency business got valued at 12 million pounds in just over a year.\n Akshay Ruparelia, at just 19 years of age, juggled his school work with negotiating property deals for his no-frills business that offers to sell properties for a fraction of the cost charged by established high street estate agents.\n This week \"doorsteps.co.uk\" became the 18th biggest estate agency in the UK just 16 months after the website went live.\n Ruparelia claims to have already sold 100 million pounds worth of properties since he set up his business.\n \"I got the website up and running and after a couple of weeks a man in Sussex asked me to sell his home and a separate chunk of land he owned beside it.\n \"I had to pay my sister's boyfriend 40 pounds to drive me to Sussex to take photographs of the house, as I hadn't passed my driving test and didn't have a car,\" he recalls.\n The north London-based schoolboy was able to sell the property and land within three weeks, which set the ball rolling.\n He started his company with 7,000 pounds, borrowed from relatives and now employs 12 people.\n In the initial stages of his business, he hired a call centre to answer calls coming in to his work while he was at school and would return the calls after his classes.\n His model is based on hiring an ever-expanding network of self-employed mothers across the UK, who show clients around the properties he has been asked to sell.\n The teenage tycoon believes his model is set to turn the property selling market away from agents in flashy suits.\n \"Quite rightly people trust mums. Every mum who works for me will be honest and tell the truth. It is important. For the majority of people selling their home is the biggest financial transaction of their lives,\" he told the 'Daily Mirror'.\n Ruparelia attributes the idea to set up a small business to reading the biography of no-frills airline Ryanair founder Michael O Leary.\n \"Mr O Leary began by selling flights for just 4.99 pounds. His point was that if you can offer customers something at a price they can't believe and you deliver what you say you will, you hook people in and your business will work,\" he said.\n The schoolboy is now well on his way to support his two deaf parents, who he says are very proud of him.\n His father, 57-year-old Kaushik, is a care worker and mother, 51-year-old Renuka, is a teaching assistant for deaf children and a support worker for deaf children with Camden Council in London.\n Ruparelia has got an offer to study economics and mathematics at Oxford University but has decided to put that on hold to grow his business.\n He began by paying himself 500 pounds a month from the profits, which he has increased to 1,000 pounds a month and is saving up to buy his first car. \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "a26602bf_in", "news_id": "52514502e42b797dfbd752a5d5511418_in", "title": "Indian-origin Teenager Becomes UK's Youngest Millionaire", "ts": 1508217145, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/indian-origin-teenager-akshay-ruparelia-becomes-uks-youngest-millionaire-1548485.html"}

The festival of lights is preceded with Dhanteras when people throng markets to buy gold items and utensils for daily utility. But have you ever wondered why? \nNew Delhi: This October has a festive fragrance to it with Diwali and Dhanteras lighting our homes. The festival of lights is preceded with Dhanteras when people throng markets to buy gold items and utensils for daily utility. But have you ever wondered why?\nToday, let's get to know why Dhanteras remains the much-awaited festival among Indians and also possibly the best one for purchasing gold. Dhanteras happens to fall on the first day of the five-day-long Diwali festivity. Interestingly, the festival also goes by the name 'Dhanatrayodashi' or 'Dhanvantari Trayodashi'. The word 'Dhan' means wealth and 'Trayodashi' means 13th day as per Hindu calendar. Dhanteras usually falls on a day or two before Lakshmi Puja during Diwali.\nIt is largely believed that on Dhanteras goddess Lakshmi visits the homes of her devotees and fulfils their wishes. It holds special significance for the business community due to the customary purchases of precious metals on this day. Also, Lord Kubera, the God of assets and wealth is also worshipped on this day.\nLegend\nThe legend has it that once a 16-year-old son of King Hima was in trouble as his horoscope predicted death by a snake-bite on the fourth day of his marriage. Therefore, on the very day, his newly-wed wife did not allow him to sleep. She laid out all her ornaments and lots of gold and silver coins in a heap at the entrance of the sleeping chamber and lit lamps all over the place.\nShe then started narrating him stories and sang songs to keep her husband awake. The next day, when Yama, the god of Death, arrived at the prince’s doorstep in the guise of a serpent, his eyes were blinded by the brilliance of the lamps and the jewellery. Yama could not enter the Prince's chamber, so he climbed on top of the heap of gold coins and sat there the entire night listening to the stories and songs.\nHowever, in the morning, he silently went away. Thus, the young prince was saved from the clutches of death by the cleverness of his new bride, and the day came to be celebrated as Dhanteras.\nThe following day came to be called Naraka Chaturdashi. Since this is the night before Diwali, it is also called 'Chhoti Diwali'. There is another legend which goes back in time when gods and devils churned the ocean for 'Amrit' (during Amrit Manthan), at that time Dhanvantari (Gods’ physician – emerged out of it carrying a jar of elixir on the auspicious day).\nBuying Gold and New Utensils\nIn India it is believed that if you buy gold, silver or new utensils on Dhanteras then it brings good luck to the family. Also, it is a customary practice to buy new clothes for the festivity where people like to dress up in their ethnic best and get ready to worship Maa Lakshmi.\nLakshmi Puja is performed in the evenings when Diyas of clay are lit to drive away the shadows of evil spirits. The entire night is filled with singing devotional bhajans in praise of the Goddess Lakshmi. Devotees sit with their families and pray to Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi on the day where prasad in the form of sweets or puris is offered to the divinity; later distributing it among each other. \n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "aa0b756c_in", "news_id": "36e9d7f9ba304a62ea6e5809b1d109ea_in", "title": "Dhanteras 2017: Why buying gold on this day is considered auspicious", "ts": 1507781211, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/spirituality/dhanteras-2017-why-buying-gold-on-this-day-is-considered-auspicious-2049461.html"}

73c952a1_in	{"content": "News18 breaks down the economic jargon and explains why everything related to economy and business is suddenly focused on fiscal stimulus.\nIn this file photo, a cashier stacks Indian currency notes inside a bank in Chandigarh, Punjab, on November 19, 2016. (Photo: Reuters/Ajay Verma)\nNew Delhi: You must have heard or read some version of the following in recent weeks: \"Narendra Modi government needs to increase spending\", “A fiscal stimulus is the need of the day\", \"The government needs to follow counter cyclical measures\", \"The government can overshoot its fiscal deficit target for the year because demand needs to be stoked” etc.\n News18 breaks down the economic jargon and explains why everything related to economy and business is suddenly focused on fiscal stimulus. \nWhat is a fiscal stimulus package?\n During a downturn governments can step in with a set of measures to reinvigorate the economy. Most often these involve increased spending by the government to increase employment and general demand in the economy, which acts as a signal for companies to increase production, which in turn will lead to more hiring and so on through the virtuous economic cycle.\nWhy does India need a fiscal stimulus?\n Picture the Indian economy as an airplane with four engines: Three of the four engines (exports, private investments and consumer demand) are sputtering and the last engine (government spending) is keeping the airplane afloat. Also, anecdotal evidence suggests that unemployment has increased. Hence, the need to provide support for the economy.\nBreaking down Fiscal Policy\n The government could lower taxes in order to put more money in consumers hands so that they spend more. However, since India has switched to the Goods and Services Tax the government may find it difficult to cut indirect tax, unless it reduces the rates on petroleum products. The government will have to wait till the next budget to announce a cut in Income Tax.\n The other option is to increase government spending – building more ports, highways, bridges etc – which stimulates construction activity and reduces unemployment.\nSo why are some people arguing against a fiscal stimulus?\n In order to increase spending the government has to borrow money, since its tax revenues cannot meet the shortfall. However, a government borrowing from the open market reduces the pool of money available for companies to borrow, and raises their interest costs. It is also argued that deficit spending by the government increases inflation, which in turn hurts the economy.\n Some economists argue that the benefits of a fiscal stimulus are overstated since the extra spending will come out of the government’s tax revenue, in other words, from the productive activities of the private sector, and so this is vigourously opposed by them.\nAre there instances in the past when India gave a fiscal stimulus?\n Yes. In the aftermath of the 2008-09 global economic crash the government cut the CENVAT rate by 4% and increased spending on infrastructure and exports. The NREGA also paid money into rural hands, thus ensuring that rural demand was not hit. These measures ensured that economic growth did not dip below 7%. \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "73c952a1_in", "news_id": "7645ca9fab98487f015b3f49229ced54_in", "title": "What is Fiscal Stimulus and Why Are Economists Talking About It?", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/business/what-is-fiscal-stimulus-and-why-are-economists-talking-about-it-1527519.html"}

(Reuters) \nIn a bid to smoothen the process of re-verification of mobile numbers using Aadhaar-based e-KYC, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has asked the operators to find new ways and methods including one-time password (OTP) based verification.

f1136a2a_in	{"content": "The JioPhone, just like Jio 4G, has stirred up a bit of a hornet's nest. So it seems. It's not every day you see a 'smart' feature phone with 4G VoLTE sold in the market at an 'effective' price of Rs 0, or more precisely for free. Countermeasures from rival companies were inevitable. One of first telecom companies to up the ante against RIL's JioPhone is Airtel.\nAirtel has joined hands with home-grown brand Karbonn to offer a full-scale 4G smartphone -- the Karbonn A40 Indian for Rs 1,399 -- \"effectively at the price of a feature phone.\" The partnership is part of Airtel's Mera Pehla 4G Smartphone initiative. The initiative will see the telecom network join hands with more OEMs in the days to come to \"create an open ecosystem of affordable 4G smartphones and bring them to market for virtually the price of a feature phone.\"\nBoth the JioPhone and the Airtel Karbonn A40 Indian are essentially contract-based phones in hindsight which means that you'll have to shell out money on a carrier plan in order to avail their benefits. There are differences, when you dig in, but all-in-all both RIL and Airtel want you to invest an amount close to Rs 7,000 over a period of three years to make the best out of their respective deals. In the end of it all, while Airtel is claiming that the Karbonn A40 Indian will cost buyers Rs 1,399 the JioPhone, according to RIL, will cost them Rs 0. Keeping all these permutations and combinations aside, here are a few key pointers that make Airtel's Karbonn A40 Indian hit the JioPhone out of the ball park:\nFirst and foremost, the JioPhone is exclusively a contract-based feature phone which means that it will be locked to a Jio SIM for all its primary requirements. Simply put, you'll have to have an activated Jio 4G SIM running at all times in order to use the JioPhone. Such contract-based phones aren't new in India, but, they came, they saw and they failed long time ago. It's been a long time that India has seen a full-fledged contract-based phone. But of course, the JioPhone changes all that. For better or for worse is yet to be seen. The Airtel Karbonn A40 Indian, on the other hand, isn't actually a contract-based smartphone in the literal sense, as you can use any SIM card you wish - even a Jio 4G SIM for that matter - with it. In fact, even if someone wants to buy the Karbonn A40 Indian without an Airtel SIM, it will be available for buying at as low as Rs 2,899. You'll have to splurge on an Airtel SIM - and an Airtel tariff plan - only if you wish to avail the Karbonn A40 Indian at an effective price of Rs 1,399. The Karbonn A40 Indian, therefore, offers greater flexibility than a JioPhone.\nThe second, but the most important bit, is that the Karbonn A40 Indian is a full-scale 4G VoLTE-capable smartphone. Without opting for any plan, you can go buy yourself Karbonn A40 Indian at a price as low as under Rs 3,000. For someone looking to make a switch from a feature phone to a smartphone, the Karbonn A40 Indian certainly makes a lot more sense as compared to a feature phone like the JioPhone. The 4G smartphone comes with a 4-inch display, a 1.3 Ghz processor with 1GB RAM and 8GB of internal storage which is expandable by up to 32GB via micro-SD card. The dual-SIM phone runs Android Nougat software and is backed by a 1,400mAh battery. It comes with a 2-megapixel camera on the rear and a 0.3-megapixel camera on the front. Connectivity options include: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. The JioPhone is a feature phone, but, it is smarter than other feature phones in the market right now. For one, it is 4G LTE and VoLTE-ready which means that it has the capability to become a user's full-fledged internet device, much like a smartphone. Jio, being a 4G-only network, requires such a phone, after all. Qualcomm and Spreadtrum have independently confirmed that RIL's 4G capable feature phone will have two versions. While one batch will be powered by a Snapdragon 205 SoC, a processor Qualcomm has made specifically for ultra-affordable 4G VoLTE phones, the other batch will come with an unspecified Spreadtrum-based processor on the inside. The software inside is a custom fork of Firefox OS -- that is KaiOS -- with features like voice search/virtual assistant built-in. The JioPhone has an all-plastic body with a T9 keypad on-board and support for as many as 22 Indian languages. The home button in the center will serve as a dedicated shortcut for firing up the voice assistant as well. It will come with a 2.4-inch QVGA colour screen and NFC support for secure mobile payments. The phone will also come with expandable memory. But, what's most important for the majority of potential buyers out there is the fact that they will be able to browse the Internet and make video calls using the JioPhone.\nAt the end of the day, the JioPhone is still a feature phone while the Karbonn A40 Indian is a smartphone for real. An actual smartphone is an actual smartphone after all. The only possible limitation, in comparison to the JioPhone, is that the Karbonn A40 Indian does not support NFC and therefore isn't meant for cashless mobile payments that require the functionality. The biggest drawback, in the case of the JioPhone in this increasingly connected world, is that the feature phone doesn't support WhatsApp and Facebook, for now. This could be a deal breaker for many.\nMoving on, RIL specifically notes that, in order to be eligible for a cash-back of Rs 1,500, users will have to return the phone to the telecom operator after three years. In the case of the Karbonn A40 Indian, however, the ownership of the smartphone is completely with the user and there is no need to return the device to Airtel/Karbonn at any point to claim the cash benefit.\nThe last bit - which is entirely subjective - is that the initial batch of JioPhones are being imported from China with RIL planning to make them in India towards the end of the year should there be great demand. The Karbonn A40 Indian, on the contrary, is a made in India smartphone right from the get-go.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "f1136a2a_in", "news_id": "59e487bd5b61090a2c80c93aa9697ab4_in", "title": "Airtel Karbonn A40 Indian hits JioPhone out of the ball park.

1689bed6_in	{"content": " WASHINGTON: India can help the US keep an eye on Pakistan as President Donald Trump has \"taken tougher approach to Islamabad harbouring terrorists\", US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said. \n Noting that Trump recently announced a new strategy for combating terrorism in Afghanistan and South Asia, Haley said one of the pillars of that strategy is the development of America's strategic partnership with India. \n \"America's overriding interest in Afghanistan and throughout South Asia are to eliminate terrorist safe havens that threaten us. And to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists, we will use all the elements of our national power economic diplomatic and military to pursue these goals,\" she said. \n Critically we will look to our economic and security partnerships with India, she added. \n In her address to an event organised by US India Friendship Council, Haley said Trump has taken a \"tougher approach to Pakistan harboring terrorists.\" \n \"Pakistan has been a partner to the US at times. We value and respect that. But, we cannot tolerate this government or any other government giving safe haven to terrorists who target Americans. This new approach will require understanding and restraint from both Pakistan and India,\" she said. \n The US, she said, is looking at India to help US more in Afghanistan particularly in economic and development assistance. \n India has already made important contributions to the stability of Afghanistan. \n \"We are really going to need India's help in Afghanistan. They are the good neighbours and partner that we have in the region,\" she said. \n \"So, having them help not only with infrastructure and the aide that they can give towards rebuilding Afghanistan, (They can) also help us to keep an eye on Pakistan,\" Haley said. \n \"That is going to be really important in making sure that we hold them accountable, because we are at a point where we kind of laid the ground work that we need to see better partnership from Pakistan. We can't continue to see them harboring the terrorists. We have to see something change. India is going to witnessing that. India is going to help us with that,\" Haley said in response to a question. \n The Trump administration is hoping to expand India's contribution in Afghanistan through a deep partnership, she said. \n The partnership between India and America is strong and getting stronger because it is rooted in a shared belief in hard work education family and achievement, she said. \n \"President Trump said when he hosted Prime Minister Modi on his visit to the US in June that, India has a true friend in the US and it is a friendship based on shared values,\" Haley said. \n \"Working at the UN really brings home how important it is for countries to share our commitment to democracy. Countries that honour and respect a voice of their people don't threaten peace and security. But, take a look at the countries that are causing most of the trouble in the world. And you will see countries that don't respect the will of their own people,\" she said. \n For instance, Haley said, Trump has just announced a new tougher approach to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. \n \"It would be catastrophic for the safety of Americans and the world if Iran became a nuclear power. But India is a nuclear power and nobody gives it a second thought. Why,\" she asked. \n \"Because India is a democracy that threatens no one,\" she said. \n The US and India have both felt the pain of terrorism and we share the commitment of defeating terrorists and the hateful ideology that motivates them, Haley said. \n Responding to a question, Haley said India is a responsible nuclear power. \n \"We want to show the world that yes there are countries that have nuclear weapon, but they are not supposed to act like North Korea. They are not supposed to manage themselves like Iran,\" she said. \n Haley also said there was a plan for her to travel to India by the end of this year, she said responding to another question. \n \"There was a plan, possibly I would go (to India) by the end of this year but there's another crisis that has come up that will send me somewhere else. But yes, I mean I would love to go back to India,\" she said. \n  \"It's amazing and special for me. I was fortunate to be there a few years ago, for the first time when I was two. And it was as magical as my parents say about it.

6efa02b8_in	{"content": "While most of the taxable articles moved under the GST regime, petroleum products are still governed by VAT system.\nQuestions are being asked if Finance Minister Arun Jaitlely-headed GST Council will pay heed to Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's suggestion on petroleum prices.\n\"The Petroleum products' inclusion in GST only way for rational fuel prices,\" tweeted Dharmendra Pradhan as the petroleum prices reached three-year high. Bringing petroleum products under the GST regime will make the fuels cheaper. \nIn Mumbai, petrol prices touched Rs 80 a litre while in Delhi, it is over Rs 70 per litre. If petrol is brought under GST, it may cost as little as Rs 38.10 in Delhi at 12 per cent GST rate.\nIt was August 2014, when petrol prices breached Rs 70 mark the last time. Back then the crude oil prices was around USD 98 per barrel. But, now the crude oil prices are hovering around USD 50 per barrel. \nWHY ARE PETROL, DIESEL SO COSTLY \nAccording to data released by the Indian Oil Corporation for the petrol price build up in Delhi, the fuel costs only Rs 26.65 at the refineries. Dealers get a litre of petrol at Rs 30.70. But, petrol is sold at Rs 70.39 a litre in Delhi. This means Rs 39.41 is charged as tax component and dealer's commission on every litre of petrol sold in the national capital.\nWhile most of the taxable articles moved under the GST regime, petroleum products are still governed by VAT system. Different states have different rates of VAT applicable on petroleum products.\nAs per the data available with the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), Delhi charges a VAT of 27 per cent on petrol while it is 47.64 per cent in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. This explains the difference of about Rs 9 in the petrol prices in the two cities.\nCENTRE'S SHARE IN HIGH PETROL PRICES\nCentre imposes excise duty on petrol and diesel. As per the PPAC data, excise duty on petrol has increased by 54 per cent since November 2014. An average increase of 46 per cent has been seen with regard to VAT on petrol while dealer's commission has been increased by as much as by 73 per cent.\nSimilarly, in the case of diesel, the excise duty has gone up by 154 per cent, VAT by 48 per cent and dealer's commission by 73 per cent. The excise duty on petrol and diesel has been increased on 12 occasions since 2014.\nThe combined effect of taxation on petroleum product by the Centre and the state governments is that the prices of petrol and diesel have gone back to 2014-level while the crude oil have become cheaper by little less than half.\nIt is not a surprise that during the same period revenue from petroleum products has increased from Rs 3.32 lakh crore in 2014-15 to Rs 5.24 lakh crore in 2016-17.\nWHAT IF PETROLEUM COMES UNDER GST\nUnder the GST, the petrol and diesel prices under the present circumstances will become substantially cheaper. The GST regime provides for taxation rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. Petrol and diesel can't be expected to be taxed below 12 per cent.\nAt 12 per cent GST, the petrol will be sold at Rs 38.1 in Delhi - almost Rs 32 cheaper than the current rate for one litre of the fuel. At 18 per cent, petrol will be 40.05 a litre in Delhi while at 28 per cent, it will cost Rs 43.44 per litre.\nIf the SUV compensation cess is imposed over and above 28 per cent GST on petrol, it will cost Rs 50.91 in Delhi - still about Rs 20 cheaper than the existing rate.\nAs for diesel, its current price in Delhi is Rs 58.72 per litre. At 12 per cent GST, diesel will sell at Rs 36.65 in the national capital. At 18 per cent GST, diesel will cost Rs 38.61.\nAt 28 per cent GST, diesel will cost Rs 48.88 in Delhi and if SUV cess is imposed, the customers will have to pay Rs 49.08 for a litre of the fuel - still Rs 9.64 cheaper than the existing rate.\nBut, bringing petroleum products under the GST involves politics. Under the GST Act, the decision to bring petroleum products under the new taxation regime can only be taken by the GST Council which has heavy representation from states, which are not ready to let go the hen laying golden eggs.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "6efa02b8_in", "news_id": "94104d8faec8cbf7c2c293eba49ab5a3_in", "title": "Petrol prices may come down from Rs 70 to Rs 38 under GST.

PM Modi said the Sardar Sarovar Dam project is dedicated to the people. (ANI image)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday inaugurated World’s second largest dam, the Sardar Sarovar Dam. He dedicated the hydro-electric-cum-irrigation project to the nation on his 67th birthday. The dam took six decades to become a reality. The dam that cost around Rs 65,000 crore will benefit millions in four states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.\nMadhya Pradesh will get the largest chunk from the electricity the hydro-electric project will generate. Maharashtra and Gujarat will also get electricity from the project, whereas Rajasthan will get water, Zee News reported. Here is the list of benefits.\n  The Sardar Sarovar Project will provide irrigation facilities to 18.45 lac ha. of land, covering 3112 villages of 73 talukas in 15 districts of Gujarat. It will also irrigate 2,46,000 ha. of land in the strategic desert districts of Barmer and Jallore in Rajasthan and 37,500 ha. in the tribal hilly tract of Maharashtra through a lift. A special allocation of 0.86 MAF of water has been made to provide drinking water to 131 urban centres and 9633 villages (53% of total 18144 villages of Gujarat) within and outside command in Gujarat for present population of 28 million and a prospective population of over 40 million by the year 2021. Water supply requirement of several industries will also be met. There are two power houses viz. River Bed Power House and Canal Head Power House with an installed capacity of 1200 MW and 250 MW respectively. The power would be shared by three states – Madhya Pradesh – 57%, Maharashtra – 27% and Gujarat 16%. It will also provide flood protection to riverine reaches measuring 30,000 ha. covering 210 villages and Bharuch city and a population of 4.0 lac in Gujarat.

At a time CJI Dipak Misra ponders whether to continue with the NIA probe ordered by his predecessor JS Khehar to verify if there was any \"ulterior or criminal\" motive in Kerala-based Muslim youth Shafin Jahan marrying a Hindu girl Akhila after she converted to Islam, pleas for NIA investigation into two more similar cases landed in the court on the eve of a crucial hearing. \nThe SC had said it wanted to ascertain if Hadiya was indeed trapped by a \"well-oiled racket that uses psychological measures to indoctrinate people and persuade them to join terror groups such as ISIS\" as alleged by her father and endorsed by the state HC, which quashed the marriage and gave the girl's custody to her father. \nA new petition has been filed by one Bindu from Kerala, who's daughter Nimisha converted to Islam to become Fathima, married a Christian who embraced Islam later and who allegedly lured her away to Afghanistan and recruited her into ISIS. The other is by Sumathi Arya, a 'victim' from Latur in Maharashtra, who was allegedly forced to convert to Islam and get indoctrinated to join and \"support the activities of SIMI, ISIS and radical preacher Zakir Naik\".\nPLEAS FILED THROUGH SC ADVOCATE AISHWARYA BHATI \nBoth of them in pleas filed through advocate Aishwarya Bhati urged that agencies such as NIA and IB be tasked \"at the earliest to investigate cases of suspected love jihad, identify culprits, draw out trends and address the issue quickly before any serious damage occurs\". \"We have information that 'jihadi romeos' are given two weeks to find a girl of another religion and six months to convert her to Islam.

On the side of Jahan, who argues that the HC had no power to annul the marriage between two adults, is the state government and Kerala police. The new petitions are also significant as they come a week after a bench headed by CJI Misra observed that primafacie, HC had no power to annul the marriage. \nHe also said Hadiya's father had no authority to keep an adult daughter under forced custody. The pleas come a day after the CPI(M)-led Kerala government said its probe did not find commission of any \"scheduled offence\" and opposed an NIA investigation.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "d49e7316_in", "news_id": "02dbf66182cb00621eec4daa25f3e19d_in", "title": "'Love Jihad': Two fresh cases reach SC, hearing resumes today", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/love-jihad-cases-supreme-court-hadiya-kerala-conversion-islam/1/1064424.html"}

In an interview with  The Hindu  , Kohli said that he decided to decline the offer because he himself doesn't consume aerated drinks. \n Kohli's deal with cola brand - Pepsi - ended earlier this year and even though the company was keen to renew the contract, he wasn't keen on endorsing something which doesn't fit the health bill. \nTwitter\n The Delhi lad had expressed earlier that he would not endorse a brand just for the sake of money. \n “If I myself won’t consume such things, I won’t urge others to consume it just because I’m getting money out of it,”  Kohli told CNN-News 18. \nAFP\n Fitness bug bit the Indian captain after the 2012 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. His poor form in the season acted as a reality check, after which he decided to change his lifestyle completely. \n His enhance fitness has allowed Kohli to become one of the finest batsmen of the current generation. \n Feature image: AFP \n", "domain": "scoopwhoop.com", "entry_id": "3f703305_in", "news_id": "a2f61bb75b620c528f482bd792a6d34a_in", "title": "Here’s Why Virat Kohli Decided To Dump Multi-Crore Deal With A Cola Company", "ts": 1505445872, "url": "https://www.scoopwhoop.com/amp/virat-kohli-decided-to-dump-multicrore-deal-with-a-cola-company-and-heres-why/"}

cccc771a_in	{"content": " Michael Clarke.(Photo: PTI)\nNew Delhi: Virat Kohli and Steve Smith are on even keel as far as leadership qualities are concerned, feels former Australia skipper Michael Clarke even though he rates the Indian captain as a slightly better ODI batsman.\nAsked who is a better batsman and leader among the two contemporary greats, Clarke observed: \"Virat is a better ODI batsman but just about that. Smith perhaps is better in longer format.\"\n\"In terms of captaincy, both are equal and they are improving. At the moment, Virat is on top as his team is winning. But again, irrespective of the number of runs you score, what matters is whether your team is winning matches or not,\" said Clarke, who is here as a TV expert for the upcoming five-match ODI series.\nHarbhajan Singh, during the last Test series, had stirred the hornet's nest by terming the Australian side as the weakest ever to tour India and even predicting a 4-0 whitewash. Australia eventually did much better to lose 1-2.\nClarke was asked the same question about whether this side, led by Smith, is the weakest to tour India, considering it did not even qualify for the Champions Trophy semi-final.\nClarke's sense of humour came to the fore as he came up with a cheeky response.\n\"I am silly but I am not that silly to give you a front-page headline for tomorrow's newspaper!\" he answered with a wry smile as everyone had a good laugh.\nOn a serious note, he said: \"Obviously, this is an opportunity for this Australian side to translate their potential into consistent performance. This team needs to back its talent as there's enough talent in the squad.\"\nThe Indian team has played an aggressive brand of cricket and Clarke did find certain similarities between the two sides led by Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli.\n \"I think there are similarities. Sourav Ganguly deserves a lot of credit for the environment he created. He never took a backseat.\nMS Dhoni, Anil Kumble and Kohli have all done it in their own ways. The current Indian team is led by an aggressive skipper who does not want to lose,\" Clarke said during a promotional event.\nClarke said premier fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, who are currently recuperating from injuries, would be missed by Australia.\nThe incentive, according to the former skipper, should be a 4-1 win which could put Australia on top of the ICC ODI rankings.\n\"A carrot right there for Smith and the boys because if they win 4-1 then they become the No.1 side again.\"\n\"The support staff has to work out the way they wish to play. Whether they want to play an aggressive brand of cricket or wish to hold back and play the full quota of overs.\n\"We still have some way to go before the 2019 World Cup, but honestly we have not won as much as we would like,\" Clarke replied when asked about the brand of cricket, he is expecting from the Aussies.\nMost of the Australian players are part of the Indian Premier League which makes it easier for them to adapt to the conditions.\n\"The experience of playing in India makes it all the more easier for the Aussies. India is like a second home for these guys as they have played in the IPL. They know the conditions and the opposition so there can't be any excuse,\" Clarke\n signed off.\n", "domain": "deccanchronicle.com", "entry_id": "cccc771a_in", "news_id": "1c6d465d0a48337296551406aee9a73a_in", "title": "Virat Kohli is a better ODI batsman, Steve Smith ahead in Tests: Michael Clarke", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/120917/virat-kohli-is-a-better-odi-batsman-steve-smith-ahead-in-tests-michael-clarke.html"}

Joti said there is \"no justification\" to have a prolonged period of imposition of model code of conduct as it could hamper development work. \n CEC Joti also added that the Gujarat government had told the Commission that it needed time to complete relief work before the model code is enforced. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "9ce34d4f_in", "news_id": "65807bbc514c89f448059d568541995b_in", "title": "'Jumlon ki baarish': Rahul Gandhi on today's massive BJP event in poll-bound Gujarat", "ts": 1508157316, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/india/jumlon-ki-baarish-rahul-gandhi-on-todays-massive-bjp-event-in-poll-bound-gujarat/articleshow/61097980.cms"}

Irani also challenged Gandhi for an open debate without a script. Tearing into his statements on dynasty politics, Smriti Irani said that Rahul Gandhi is taking his frustration out in the USA as his party could not get a mandate in the 2014 elections. “He is forgetting that India still has voters,” she said.\n“When Mr Gandhi said that dynasts rule in India, he forgot that right now, many are ruling without a political legacy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Kovind and Vice-President themselves have no political legacy. This proves that in India, democracy works on merit,” says Smriti Irani.\nEarlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi had addressed a students’ gathering at University of California, Berkeley,  and spoke about dynasty politics and online trolling. “Most of the country runs like this, so don’t go after me, Akhilesh Yadav is a dynast, Mr Stalin is a dynast, Mr Dhumal’s son is a dynast,” Rahul Gandhi said.\n“The fact that Mr. Gandhi chose to belittle the PM is not surprising in fact expected. After failing to connect with people of India Mr Gandhi chooses the platform of convenience for berating his political opponents,” she said, adding, “Fact that he (Rahul Gandhi) says that dynasts and dynasties are the very fulcrum of India in itself is an anomaly.”\nCalling him a failed dynast, Irani said that nobody in India agrees with Rahul Gandhi and the fact that Gandhi admitted that the Congress party became arrogant and lost elections under Sonia Gandhi is a “big political confession in itself”.\n“Passing remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not new for Rahul Gandhi. Narendra Modi comes from a poor family and has achieved this position with his hard work, commitment, and honesty. Our President Ram Nath Kovind achieved this position on his own. These personalities are an inspiration to us,” said Smriti Irani.\nLater in the day, a special briefing will be held by Deputy leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "d17dff0e_in", "news_id": "b525bdd77f7b5072862818290c13a93a_in", "title": "Smriti Irani Tears Into Rahul Gandhi’s UC Berkeley Address, Challenges Him For an Open Debate ‘Without Script’", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://www.india.com/news/india/smriti-irani-tears-into-rahul-gandhis-uc-berkeley-address-challenges-him-for-an-open-debate-without-script-2465333/"}

bb402ffc_in	{"content": "The two leading Asian powers whose bilateral interplay is among the most happening engagements on the world stage has a direct impact on the Asian giant and a near-superpower: China.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi (L) and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe. (Getty Images)\n The just-concluded twelfth India-Japan annual summit was a blunt message to China. This was Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe’s fourth consecutive meet and the former, in his own way, has conveyed to Beijing that New Delhi has allies, maybe not at the battlefront, but definitely in the international community.\n The September 14 summit in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, was laden with strategic agenda and all of it related to intensifying relations between Asia's two major democracies, economies.\n The two leading Asian powers whose bilateral interplay is among the most happening engagements on the world stage has a direct impact on the Asian giant and a near-superpower: China.\n Here are five major takeaways from the summit:\nDEFENCE: While the much-awaited deal on the purchase of ShinMaywa US-2 amphibious aircraft couldn’t be signed during this visit — it’s still a matter of when not if.\n This breakthrough defence deal is a sign of the importance that Japan attaches to India considering the track record that the east-Asian country has not exported any sensitive defence-related equipment to any foreign country in the last 70 years.\n The Japanese are by nature not defence material exporters either, a fact that was demonstrated last year when the multi-billion dollar deal with Australia for export of Soryu submarines fell through.\n The joint statement released after the Modi-Abe summit in Gandhinagar gave an indication of the upcoming breakthrough over the aircraft deal. “Japan’s readiness to provide its state-of-the-art US-2 amphibian aircraft was appreciated as symbolising the high degree of trust between the two countries. The two governments decided to continue their discussions in this regard.”\nSTRATEGIC: Joint exercises and burgeoning strategic ties between India and Japan, with other powers like the United States and Australia, form the bedrock of fast expanding strategic relations between the two Asian powers.\n Modi and Abe decided to take these strategic ties to an even higher trajectory. Consider the following clause from the joint statement: “The two Prime Ministers welcomed the recently held annual Defence Ministerial Dialogue and the first Defence Industry Forum in Tokyo on 5 September, which was addressed by the two Defence Ministers as well as the discussions covering other promising initiatives in defence industry cooperation. They recognised the importance of enhancing interactions between governments and defence industries of the two countries in order to encourage equipment collaboration including defence and dual-use technologies.”\nINDIA’S NORTHEAST: Japan holds the unique distinction of being the only foreign power which is welcomed with open arms by India for the development of India’s north-eastern states and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n It’s not without reason that the Indo-Japan joint statement underlines the need for developing “smart islands” and improving the connectivity in all aspects. This has an undisclosed reference to Andaman and Nicobar Islands and what India, Japan may be planning together, with an eye on China, in these strategically located landmasses. As for the Indo-Japan joint plans with regard to the India’s northeast, consider the following clause of the joint statement: “The two Prime Ministers welcomed the India-Japan cooperation on development of India’s North Eastern Region (NER) as a concrete symbol of developing synergies between India’s Act East policy and Japan’s Free and Open Indo Pacific Strategy. In this context, they noted with satisfaction the setting up of the India-Japan Act East Forum. They appreciated the cooperation between Japan and North Eastern Region of India, ranging from key infrastructure such as road connectivity, electricity, water supply and sewage, to social and environmental sustainability such as afforestation and community empowerment, as well as people-to-people exchanges including the ‘IRIS Program’ inviting youth from the NER to Japan.”\nBULLET TRAIN: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project was indubitably the biggest optic of the Modi-Abe summit. The two sides exchanged notes for 100 billion yen (900 million US dollars) as the first Official Development Assistance or ODA loan for the project.\n The Japanese have extended a soft loan for 50 years at an unbelievable interest rate of 0.1% for the $16 billion project. The terms of the loan also carry a grace period of 10 years for repayment, demonstrating how intrinsically close the Japanese have become in uplifting India’s infrastructure.\nTERRORISM: In a major brownie point to PM Modi, Shinzo Abe stood solidly with India on the issue of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The Japanese side, for the first time, referred to Pakistan-Based terror outfits in the joint statement. This should go a long way in aiding India’s attempts to isolate Pakistan in the international community. “PM Narendra Modi and PM (Shinzo) Abe look forward to convening (the) 5th Japan-India consultation on terrorism and to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including Al-Qaida, ISIS, JeM, LeT and their affiliates,” said the joint statement.\n This is the second in September when Pakistan has come under fire at an international summit for its sins of omission and commission on the terror issue. For the first time, the BRICS Summit held earlier this month agreed to a strongly worded BRICS Declaration slamming Pakistan without naming it, as it \"deplored\" terror attacks in member countries and the \"violence caused\" by Pakistan-based terror outfits. The part that should further aggravate Pakistan’s heartache is that it was hosted by its all-weather friend – China.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "bb402ffc_in", "news_id": "372e9eaf3d5b67ec5a8863d116585eb9_in", "title": "Aircraft Deal, Bullet Train Among Five Major Takeaways from Modi–Abe Meet", "ts": 1505445872, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/aircraft-deal-bullet-train-among-five-major-takeaways-from-pm-narendra-modi-shinzo-abes-india-japan-summit-1518549.html"}

TOI has learnt that the 38-year-old left-arm pacer has picked the T20I against New Zealand, to be played at the Ferozeshah Kotla in the Capital on November 1, to be his final international match for India. \n Nehra was brought into the T20 side for the ongoing three-match series against Australia after a gap of eight months since playing England earlier in the year. But captain Virat Kohli hasn't played him in the first two games. \n  It is learnt that Nehra had a word with the captain and the team management on Wednesday afternoon. \"He (Nehra) called the entire squad and said he is calling it quits from international cricket. That caught the entire team by surprise but he requested if he could play his last game at his home ground in Delhi,\" a source close to the development told TOI. \n There are theories that not making the playing XI in the first two games could have triggered the decision. But a top BCCI official said Nehra had already planned for this. \"The team was easing him into top-flight cricket. He has not played any cricket after getting injured in the last IPL. He said he would have retired after the third match against Australia in Hyderabad. Since India play their next T20 in Delhi, Nehra prefers to play that match,\" the official informed. \n Nehra has had an injury-plagued career which spanned 18 years. The frequent injuries forced him to retire from Test cricket 10 years ago. He has been part of two ODI World Cup campaigns - 2003 and 2011. He was ignored by the selectors despite taking 2/33 in against Pakistan in the 2011 World Cup semifinal. That happens to be his last ODI since he fractured a finger in that semifinal. \n The Delhi pacer was recalled ahead of the World T20 Championship in India in 2016 to add experience and variety to the attack. His performance since has been top notch. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "aa805fb0_in", "news_id": "647644766250eefbd027e98842b63a3c_in", "title": "Nehra to retire after New Zealand T20 at Kotla", "ts": 1507736984, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/ashish-nehra-to-retire-after-new-zealand-t20-at-kotla/articleshow/61037324.cms"}

65a762ca_in	{"content": "Samsung is gifting a free Galaxy Note 8, its flagship phone that costs Rs 67,900 in India, to people during flights. At least that is what the company did a few days ago in Spain when it handed out free Note 8 to all 200 passengers in a plane. It was part of Samsung's current promotion, which the company was doing in partnership with Iberia airlines in Spain and it still left the people who got the device all surprised, amused and -- in most instances -- extremely happy. They had an ear-to-ear grin as Samsung gave its latest and greatest phone to them for free.\nSo just why Samsung is offering an expensive phone like the Note 8 free to people? Well, it wants to build the trust with consumers, especially the people who fly, after that trust went up in smoke during the Note 7 debacle.\nThe Galaxy Note 7, due to its fire-prone battery, was deemed a hazard to air travel. In fact, airlines across the world had banned the Note 7. But Note 8 is safe and to prove the point, Samsung is giving away free Note 8 to people with a message that says, \"A year ago we asked you to turn it off, we welcome you today on board.\"\nWell, good for people who were on that Iberia flight between Madrid and A Coruna. But what about everyone else? Will some lucky people on some lucky flight in India too will end up with the free Galaxy Note 8 gift from Samsung?\nNow, it is unfair for everyone to expect a free Note 8 from Samsung. It is an expensive phones and Samsung surely can't afford to give away millions or even thousands of these phones, not especially after it had to scrap millions of Note 7 devices and write off several billion dollars from its balance sheet. But the company is serious about telling the world that the Note 8 is different from Note 7, that it is perfectly safe and that Samsung cares. The best way to say it, as the lit faces of the passengers on the Iberia flight showed, is to offer the free gift.\nIn India too the Note 7 was recalled. Basically, it didn't exactly reach people's hands. It was launched in India but before the shipping to consumers could start, reports of battery issues with it surfaced and then Samsung paused everything. Some shopkeepers though had got it. These units were later recalled. And just for precaution the flights regulator in India had banned the Note 7 from planes.\nIt is also important to note that Samsung giving away the Note 8 devices was done after the company kick-off a campaign with Iberia. For now, there is no such campaign going on with any Indian airline. But that also doesn't rule out that there won't be such a campaign. May be Samsung will do something similar to what it did with Iberia in India. May be next time you take a flight with Air India from Delhi to Mumbai, you will also get a free Galaxy Note 8. Samsung is known for its extravagant ways, in good way, so do keep your eyes open next time you are flying.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "65a762ca_in", "news_id": "c3cadf21cfb3f7480806131828831670_in", "title": "Samsung is gifting free Galaxy Note 8, next time you are in plane", "ts": 1508994841, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/samsung-is-gifting-free-galaxy-note-8-to-fliers-keep-eyes-open-next-time-you-are-in-plane/1/1075617.html"}
3a12dd8d_in	{"content": "(Picture Courtesy: Hockey India Twitter handle)\n NEW DELHI: The Indian hockey team continued their dominance in the Asia Cup 2017, recording their third consecutive victory in the tournament after getting the better of arch-rivals Pakistan 3-1 in their third and last Pool A match. With this victory, India finished the pool unbeaten with nine points. \n Pakistan, however, managed to progress to the 'Super 4s' stage with four points on the basis of a better goal difference. \nChinglensana Singh, Ramandeep Singh, and Harmanpreet Singh were the scorers for India. \n Both teams failed to break the deadlock in the first quarter with India creating chances repeatedly. Howevere, despite their attack, India were unable to break Pakistan's defence. India conceded the first penalty corner of the match in the last minute of the quarter but Pakistan couldn't make the most of it. \n Chinglensana opened India's account through a field goal in the 17th minute. He picked up Akashdeep Singh's brilliant pass from left flank and hit a thunderous shot that thudded into the goal. Pakistan earned their second penalty corner but this time Indian goalkeeper Suraj Karkera came up with a superb save to deny them the equaliser. India headed into the half-time 1-0 ahead. \n Pakistan made a ferocious run into India's box after being down to nine-men in the third quarter but new goalkeeper Akash Chikte pulled off a brilliant save to ensure India did not give away their lead. Ramandeep bettered India's advantage in the 43rd minute as he dived close to the goalline to connect a cross and deflecting it past the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 in India's favour. Two minutes later, Harmanpreet added a third for India when he successfully converted a penalty corner. \n Pakistan upped the ante in the last quarter with Ali Shan striking in the 48th minute to give his side a chance. That goal seemed to have pumped adrenaline into the side as they won a few more unsuccessful penalty corners. However, the pressure of trailing by two goals resulted in Pakistan losing steam again in the end, and India once again came in with a flurry of attack before the final whistle went off. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "3a12dd8d_in", "news_id": "8a50b4e52c3547cb9c70e1c191d89665_in", "title": "Asia Cup Hockey: India beat Pakistan 3-1 to top Pool A", "ts": 1508077070, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/asia-cup-hockey-india-beat-pakistan-3-1-to-top-pool-a/articleshow/61091265.cms"}

In terms of video, the latest promo from OnePlus is sharper and tries to impress upon viewers how brand is trying to portray itself as a company that makes funky, cool products for young consumers. Whereas the last year's video was more laidback -- and cheesy to be honest, showing a guy who arranges virtual meeting with his mom and his girl friend's family, this time the video personifies Diwali as the most ravishing festival who works hard to fulfill everyone's dreams and wishes but is eventually bogged down by all the madness surrounding the festival. In a way, she reflects the lives and challenges of a modern youth who is expected to multi-task and consistently deliver on everyone's expectations. In this case, Diwali lacks a partner who can help her retain the title of the 'Star Performer' and help her through multi-tasking and making the festival memorable for everyone. OnePlus 5 comes to her rescue as the perfect partner for Diwali which brightens her up. \nThe idea is simple. OnePlus wants to appeal to young, tech enthusiasts and the brand has always experimented with newer ways to reach out to them. Sure, the promo highlights all that is great about the OnePlus 5 such as its speed, hardware, camera and, you guessed it right, the Dash Charging technology that remains quite unique to the OnePlus phones. \nAccording to a recent report by market research firm IDC, OnePlus was among the top 3 companies in India in the premium phone category in Q2, 2017. IDC defines the premium category as the market that has phones with selling price of around Rs 25,000 or more. \nAlthough we don't know much about the fun part, whether the OnePlus is the \"perfect partner\" or not, we do know that it is a very good phone. Here is what we wrote when we reviewed it: \n\"The OnePlus 5 is a phone for anyone who wants a fast, capable and versatile phone with clean software and some unique features without spending Rs 50,000 on a Google Pixel. It's an unbeatable value for money phone.\"\nSince its arrival in India in 2014, OnePlus has done well. Its first phone OnePlus 1 was a big hit. The OnePlus 2 and the OnePlus X  didn't see the same degree of success but with the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, the company regained its mojo. In fact, the OnePlus 3T and the OnePlus 3 are so successful that they have catapulted OnePlus into the top brands in the market. \nRecently, a survey by Cyber Media Research found that OnePlus was a brand trusted by 100 per cent consumers. \"Prabhu Ram, Head - Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, noted, \"As per the latest CMR MICI Survey findings, one interesting trend that stands out is that while Apple and Samsung dominate, a brand like OnePlus is securing a healthy mindshare amongst Indian smartphone consumers.\" CMR further noted that the OnePlus was ranked first with customers regarding it as the \"highest recommended brand.\"\nThis buzz around the brand, and the connect with consumers, is possibly the reason that is also driving OnePlus to move into newer territories. in a way, its Diwali is not only aimed at its existing consumers, but also probably at those who are yet to come under its fold. After years of being only an online-player, the company has this year started its offline operations. It initially opened a few exclusive stores -- there is one in Bangalore as well as one in Noida among other cities. Apart from the brick and mortar shops, the OnePlus smartphones are also available at the official online OnePlus store and exclusively on Amazon. \n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "907e80c_in", "news_id": "4f8f91899a1c1048f8d57740d0b8ed30_in", "title": "OnePlus at it yet again, uses Diwali promo to put OnePlus 5 in spotlight", "ts": 1507563458, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/oneplus-at-it-yet-again-uses-diwali-promo-to-put-oneplus-5-in-spotlight/1/1061188.html"}

Chinese railways had completed feasibility study for the project a year ago. \n An internal brief of the Mobility Directorate on the status of nine high-speed projects of the railways, accessed by PTI, shows that the Chennai-Bangalore-Mysore corridor, a 492 km stretch, lies in limbo because the Chinese railways has failed to respond to the ministry's communiques. \n \"The Chinese company submitted the final report in November 2016 and after that the Chinese team has suggested for a face to face interaction. No date has been fixed from their side,\" said the note prepared by the Mobility Directorate. \n On the reason for the delay, the brief states -- \"lack of response\" from Chinese railways. \n The brief also states that the feasibility study by the China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co Ltd (CREEC) was submitted to the Railway Board in November 2016 and after that the Chinese company had sought meetings with officials of the Board. \n However, officials say that the Board has been unable to get in touch with officials of CREEC despite repeated communications sent to them via mails in the last six months. \n \"We have even tried to get in touch with them through their embassy here, but we are yet to hear from them,\" said an official. \n The ministry officials said that it was \nthe standoff between the two countries in Bhutan's Doklam area between June 16 and August 28 this year that seems to have derailed the project. \n \"The study began in 2014 and they submitted the report in 2016. The entire cost was borne by them. In fact they have shown so much interest in collaborating with us for other projects as well, so we think that it was the standoff that must have raised doubts,\" said a senior rail official. \n An email to the Chinese embassy by the PTI on the issue did not elicit any response. \n  Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam since June 16 after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese army. Bhutan and China have a dispute over Doklam. \n The brief, prepared by the department in charge of all the high speed corridors, also states that except the Chinese roadblock, work on the eight other projects was on track. \n China had in fact not only pitched for \nthe Mumbai-Ahemdabad high speed network, which was finally bagged by Japan, but also for the bullet project in the Mumbai-Delhi sector, which is yet to be finalised. \n China is also training railway engineers in heavy hauling and it is with Chinese collaboration that India is setting up its \n The Chennai-Bangalore-Mysore corridor is one of nine such high speed corridors being developed by the ministry.

The Mi Mix 2 mobile will be Flipkart exclusive based on tweets by the e-commerce website. Mi Mix 2 is the new flagship for the Indian market from Xiaomi, which is the number two smartphone vendor in the market. Given this is a flagship phone, Mi Mix 2’s price in India could be on the higher side, closer to Rs 30,000 depending on the variant that is launched. Xiaomi will have a live stream for the event on its website as well.\nMi Mix 2 sports an edge-to-edge display which is 5.99-inches in size. However, unlike traditional phones, Mi Mix 2 does not have a front camera on the top, but has instead moved the 5 MP sensor to the bottom. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 was launched in China in three variants: 6GB RAM + 64 GB storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage, and finally one with 6GB RAM + 256GB on board storage.

For the unaware, the Reliance JioPhone was announced at the Reliance Industries AGM meeting in July 2017 with an effective price of Rs. 1,500.\nA PTI report cites that the delivery of Reliance JioPhone will begin from rural areas and small towns before it reaches urban areas. “The Chairman (Mukesh Ambani) had said that the JioPhone will bridge the digital divide between rural and urban India. Therefore, delivery of Reliance JioPhone will start this Sunday in rural areas and small towns,” highlights the report. PTI sourced this information from a retail channel partner.\nIn addition, the channel partner also revealed to the publication that the deliveries of the first six million Reliance JioPhone will be completed in 10-15 days. “The delivery of the first lot of 6 million will be completed in 10-15 days,” revealed the report. However, the report didn’t reveal when the company will start the second round of pre-booking for the Reliance JioPhone. However, Reliance Jio is yet to respond to this report, but the Mukesh Ambani-led company earlier this month confirmed that the deliveries of Reliance JioPhone will begin during Navratri period.\nYou can track the order status of your Reliance JioPhone via both online and offline channels. Reliance Jio is making it easy for users by adding the delivery tracking option online. To check the status of your Reliance JioPhone online, you should download the MyJio application from Google Play Store or Apple App store.\nAfter downloading the application, login with the same Jio number which you used to book the Reliance JioPhone. After logging in, you can find an option called ‘Track order,’ where you need to enter the details which you gave while pre-booking the Reliance JioPhone. After entering correct details, you can see the status of your Reliance JioPhone.\nAnother way of checking the order status is by dialling the Jio customer care number- 18008908900. That said, you have to make the call from the Jio number which you used to pre-book the Reliance JioPhone. After calling the number, just follow the on-screen instructions. Reliance Jio will send the delivery details of the Reliance JioPhone via an SMS after disconnecting the call.\nIf you want to check the delivery date of your Reliance JioPhone offline, head over to the store where you pre-booked the device and inquire about the delivery of the Reliance JioPhone.\nFinally, the Reliance JioPhone is said to be shipping to the first batch of pre-bookers. As said earlier, the Reliance JioPhone is effectively priced at Rs. 0, but as a security measure, Jio is collecting Rs. 1,500, which will be completely refundable after three years.\nHave you pre-booked the Reliance JioPhone?

b5a1f171_in	{"content": "If Kohli scores 36 runs today, the skipper will become the first Indian and eighth overall to complete 7000 runs in T20Is. \nNew Delhi: The Virat Kohli-led Indian outfit has been brilliant so far in the ongoing limited-overs' series against Australia. They have won the five-match ODI series 4-1, then beat the Aussies in the first T20I match in Ranchi. On Tuesday, they will hope to continue to dominate the Aussies in their second T20I match in Guwahati.\nHere are five talking points ahead of the match:\n1. India's outstanding T20I record against Australia\nIndia has an outstanding record against Australia in the shortest format of the game. Now the target is to improve it further with two matches remaining in the series. India are undefeated in their last seven T20Is against the Aussies.\n2. Guwahati gets a new cricket stadium\nThe second T20I match between India and Australia will be played in a brand new stadium. Flanked by hills, the Barsapara stadium, can probably challenge HPCA Dharamsala stadium's scenic beauty. The foundation stone of the stadium was laid by the then Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi in June 2004. Today, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will officially open it. It will become the 49th venue to host an International game and the 18th to host a T20I match in India.\n3. Rohit Sharma's T20I woes\nRegarded as one of the greatest modern-day opening batsmen in ODIs, Rohit Sharma, however, has an indifferent record in the T20Is, especially in India. Considering his fluency and class, the 30-year-old should be equally prolific in both the formats. But, that's not the case. He has an average of 21.86 in India.\n4. Importance of David Warner\nDavid Warner will be leading the Aussies for the seventh time in International cricket. The 30-year-old had won all the five matches (3 ODIs and 2 T20Is) he captained Australia before this series. He tasted first defeat as Australia captain in Ranchi. The stand-in skipper is positive though, and promised 'Aussie brand of cricket' in Guwahati to keep the three-match series alive.\n5. But the focus is clearly on Virat Kohli\nIndia captain, no doubt, is the man of the hour. But his batting performance has been an area of concern for the team. The 28-year-old will be eager to score big. And he has got plenty of incentives to do just that. Ne needs one boundary to become the third player, after Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mohammad Shahzad, to hit 200 fours in T20Is. If he scores 36 runs today, the skipper will become the first Indian and eighth overall to complete 7000 runs in T20Is.\n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "b5a1f171_in", "news_id": "ac97c71cb39d4680575161c8e7af8e1f_in", "title": "India vs Australia: Five talking points ahead of 2nd T20I", "ts": 1507617574, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/cricket/india-vs-australia-five-talking-points-ahead-of-2nd-t20i-2049042.html"}

(Image: Screenshot from YouTube)\nA Samsung Galaxy Duos smartphone recently exploded and burst into flames in a man’s shirt pocket, according to reports. The incident, which took place in Indonesia on September 30, was captured on CCTV camera. Samsung has admitted it was a Galaxy Duos smartphone that caught fire. The South Korean major, however, is not at fault in this case given that the battery used in the phone was not an authorised one.\nThe incident was reported by Channel News Asia last week, according to a report on CNET. In the CCTV footage, which has gone viral on the internet, the man is seen putting the phone inside in his shirt pocket. In the next couple of seconds, the phone bursts into bright blue flames and the man falls to the ground as he tries to take his shirt off. The CCTV footage shows a bystander helping the man who manages to take off the shirt in time.\nAccording to the Channel News Asia report, the incident took place in Hotel Ciputra Semarang and the man has been identified as hotel staff Yulianto.\nThe Daily Mail has quoted Yulianto as saying, “There was a strong sensation of heat and I felt something start to shake. Before I knew what was happening there was fire and I panicked. I took off my shirt as quickly as I could.”\nThe phone is not visible in the video, but Samsung confirmed it to be a Galaxy Duos phone. In an email to CNET, Samsung’s representatives said the battery used in the device was not manufactured by them. The statement to CNET adds, “We sincerely wish for our customer’s swift recovery, and strongly recommend all our consumers to use Samsung’s genuine or approved batteries that have been specifically designed for use in Samsung products.”\nSamsung Galaxy Duos was initially launched in 2013 and this is a very old model from the company. For Samsung, the most serious issue with phones exploding and catching fire was around the Galaxy Note 7, which was eventually pulled out of production. However, in this particular case, the company has been quick to respond and point out the real issue.\nIn India too, there have been reports of phones catching fire. Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 reportedly caught fire in two separate incidents in the country. In one case, the company had claimed a faulty charger was used that caused the fire. When it comes to battery and old smartphones, most companies will insist that customers use authorised genuine chargers. Also unauthorised repairs, battery change can cause the device to malfunction and, as we’ve seen in some recent cases, catch fire.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "6a1acf18_in", "news_id": "ce40a1031331614a9dd5088e246b6d41_in", "title": "Watch Video: Samsung Galaxy Duos explodes in man’s pocket", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/samsung-galaxy-duos-explodes-in-mans-pocket-caught-on-cctv-camera-video-4881419/"}

A former girlfriend of the commander of the Pakistan-based terror outfit is said to have helped security forces nail him.\n\"I want him dead,\" said a Kashmiri young woman in her early 20s as she walked into a senior Jammu and Kashmir Police officer's office one fine day last year. She wanted Jaish-e-Muhammad's operational commander Khalid killed. \n\"I will lead you to his tracks, you do the rest (in killing him),\" she told the police officer. \nAfter a brief encounter, Khalid was killed  by the security forces today in north Kashmir. The woman was Khalid's girlfriend with several midnight trysts. \nWHY SHE WANTED KHALID DEAD? \nA year ago, the woman discovered that she was pregnant. She revealed this with great joy expecting Khalid to be as excited as she. But, his answer led to heartbreak. Khalid told her that he wanted nothing to do with either her or the child in the womb. \nScorned, she left with a cousin to Jalandhar in Punjab, where the unborn child was clandestinely aborted. \nShe came back enraged and determined to eliminate the man, who she believed, used her and led to her humiliation and death of her unborn child.\nWOMAN ON MISSION\nThe woman's resolve for revenge made sure that Khalid's days were counted. There were several close calls with the near-kill escape of the terrorist with a long run of eight years.\nKhalid had been the mastermind behind Jaish-e-Muhammad's deadly fidayeen attacks over the years. He had been sending in terrorist from North to South Kashmir. \nKhalid kept the pot boiling for Pakistan in Kashmir Valley. He was behind a dozen attacks in North Kashmir mostly in Sopore, Baramulla, Handwara and Kupwara.\nKhalid though retained a lover-boy image, and even at the time of his death had reportedly had three-four girlfriends. \nTIP-OFFS AND FINAL ENCOUNTER\nSome time back, the woman gave concrete information about Khalid's presence at a particular location. However, the police party reached the spot and began cordon operation only after he had left. On other occasions, he dropped in unexpectedly.\nThis time too, the Jammu and Kashmir police got information from sources close to the woman. A covert team waited for Khalid's entry in Sopore. \nKhalid had come to meet an important contact. He fired indiscriminately but Special Operations Group (SOG) retaliated quickly injuring him. The firing lasted only four minutes. \nKhalid managed to reach a residence, close to a government school in Ladoora. Cordoned and cornered, the Jaish-e-Muhammad chief in Kashmir was neutralised by the SOG, 3 battalions of CRPF (179, 177, 92) and 32 Rashtriya Rifles (RR).\nWith Khalid's killing, a reign of terror came to an end in Jammu and Kashmir.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "a3d1a37f_in", "news_id": "88051299a338e67c27f7cd8a64d60535_in", "title": "Love, Sex, Dhokha: Story behind killing of a Jaish-e-Mohammad commander", "ts": 1507555340, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/love-sex-dhoka-jaish-e-muhammad-khalid-kashmir/1/1064623.html"}

(Source: File)\n“I didn’t think of becoming India coach. BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary and Dr Sridhar (GM Cricket Operations) came to me. They requested me. I took my time. I spoke to Virat Kohli. Voh bhi yahi keh rahe they, tab jaake I applied. (He also said the same, only then I applied).” Virender Sehwag, who lost the India coaching job to Ravi Shastri, has broken his two-month silence to throw light on the events that transpired in the run-up to the most coveted sporting job in the country. In an interview with India TV, Sehwag revealed he had applied for India-coach job in May only after speaking to India captain Kohli, who urged him to do so, and after he was initially approached by the BCCI officials.\nWhen asked why despite being friends with the cricket advisory committee, comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, he didn’t get the job, Sehwag said with a smile: “Meri setting nahi thi na! (I didn’t have a lobbying power)”. Sehwag clarified that he didn’t think that Shastri had that “setting”: I won’t say that (he had). They had to choose the best candidate among 10 applicants. Ravi Shastri was the best. And he got the chance to coach.”\nSehwag also clarified that he would never have applied for the job had he known Shastri would also show interest. Sehwag said he had even asked Shastri why he hadn’t applied for the role during Champions Trophy in England. “When we were commenting in England, I asked him, why aren’t you applying and he told me, “ek baar galti kar chuka hoon, dobara nahi karoonga.” (I had made mistake once, won’t repeat it twice). It was a controversial sequence of events that culminated in Shastri bagging the job in July.\nFirst Anil Kumble resigned after a rift with Kohli, then as reported first by The Indian Express in May, the BCCI officials approached Sehwag but when it seemed he was the frontrunner, Shastri entered the pitch, and eventually ran away with the job. It was reported that Sehwag didn’t get the job because he wanted to bring his own set of support staff and that didn’t sit well with Kohli who wanted the likes of Sanjay Bangar, as batting coach, and Bharat Arun as bowling coach. On Friday, Sehwag said that it’s common practice that a coach would have a support staff of his preference.\n“Every coach desires to bring in his own support staff. Ek ya do changes zaroor karta hai support staff mey. Jo mere issab sey kaam kare, main jo baate karoon, voh implement ho. (who would work according to my style, and implement the things I want). If I had become coach, one or two changes would definitely have been there.” It was reported then that Ganguly wanted Sehwag as the coach but it fell through after consultations with Kohli. “Did he tell you that (Ganguly was backing him)? All that was just news — true, false, no one knows. I was friends with all of them (in the panel). Ganguly, Tendulkar, and I do commentary with Laxman – bhrata bulate hain (we call each other brother). But that decision (to appoint a coach) can’t be based on friendship. Who they felt as best candidate, they picked him.”\nSehwag said that he tried to patch things between Kohli and Kumble, before he applied for the role. “Pareshani thi (I was troubled) with the way Kumble exit happened. Even when I was in England for commentary (for Champions Trophy), I tried to speak to both people. Dono sey baat karke, yadi dono reh jaaye, un dono ki ban jaaye – kumble and kohli ki then acha ho. (if both could stay, if things could work out well between them, it would have been for the best.”)\nSehwag also backed Kumble as coach, saying that he was the best out there. “Perhaps circumstances weren’t right for him to stay. The biggest thing – what we call baddapan (magnanimity) that Kumble resigned himself. Lekin (whole procees) galat tha (whole process was wrong). Perhaps, time kharaab tha aur unko jaana pada.Warna unsey behter and kabil coach toh koi bhi nahi tha. (There was no one better or able than him as coach).\nSehwag also shared that he wasn’t hurt or upset with the decision to appoint Shastri as he respected the decision of the legendary cricketers in the panel. “Why would I get hurt? Who were the people who were selecting — Tendulkar, Ganguly, Laxman. So, there is no question of being sad, disappointed, or upset.” On July 10, in a press conference where it was expected that name of new coach would be announced, Ganguly had instead said that he would consult Kohli before making that decision. “We feel as the advisory committee that he’s the captain, which is the most important thing in cricket,” Ganguly had said then. “Maybe that’s why Ganguly wanted to speak to Kohli,” Sehwag said. “When Kumble became coach first time, that time no one was spoken to. Sirf announce kiya. It’s better when you appointing coach, you speak to captain and senior players.”\nThe format of the India TV interview also allowed audience to question Sehwag, and when a fan asked him whether he got angry at a player during his playing days so much so that he felt like slapping him? (Kabhi aisa hua hai ki, aapko bahut gussa aaya ho kisi player pey and usko do lagane ka dil kara ho?!). Sehwag smiled, before saying he did feel angry at Kohli on one occasion.\n“Once, I did get angry at Kohli, during the Perth Test in 2012. While fielding at the boundary, he showed the (middle) finger to the crowd. Match referee fined him. I got angry because in that whole series, he was the only player who was scoring runs for us and khuda-na-khaasta ban ho jaata, our batting would have collapsed. That’s why I got angry at him. Aisi harkatey mat karo… tum toh ban ho jaoge, and team ka nuksaan hoga. (Don’t do such antics, not only would you get banned but the team would be in trouble.),” he added.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "46c747d8_in", "news_id": "82eefe6858b86b953cfc7c3e738ffb5b_in", "title": "Virender Sehwag on missing India coach job: Meri setting nahi thi", "ts": 1505534822, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virender-sehwag-on-missing-india-coach-job-meri-setting-nahi-thi-4845654/"}

One of the most popular tourist draws in the country, India is often identified as the ‘land of the Taj’. ((Burhaan Kinu/HT PHOTO))\nUpdated: Oct 17, 2017 16:28 IST\n By Umesh Raghuvanshi, Lucknow, Hindustan Times\nUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday the Taj Mahal was an important tourist draw and it was immaterial who built it, in an apparent move to stem a controversy over the 17th-century marble monument to love.\n“It does not matter who built it and for what reason. It was built by the blood and sweat of Indian labourers ... It is very important for us, especially from the tourism perspective. It is our priority to provide facilities and safety to tourists,” the chief minister said in Kushinagar.\nAdityanath also announced his plan to visit the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri and other important monuments in Agra, a day after Bharatiya Janata Party’s Sangeet Som kicked up a storm over the mausoleum. \n“The CM will visit the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort on October 26 to review tourism schemes in Agra. The CM will also take stock of the work being carried out in Agra,” an official spokesperson said.\nThis will be the first visit of Adityanath to the Taj Mahal after taking over as the chief minister on March 19.\n Adityanath’s remark is being seen as an attempt by the state government to put to rest the controversy after BJP’s Sardhana legislator Som said the Taj Mahal was “built by traitors”. The statement drew widespread criticism. \nThe BJP too appeared to disown Som’s remarks and called his comments on the Unesco World Heritage Site, his “individual view”.\nThe Taj Mahal draws crores of rupees in annual revenue but has received a barrage of negative comments in recent months from top BJP leaders, including Adityanath – who in June said the ivory-white marble mausoleum didn’t represent “Indian culture”.\nAdityanath presided over a meeting to review the development projects in Agra on May 7 and also inspected the Yamuna but did not visit the Taj Mahal or areas close to the monument.\n On July 11, the Adityanath government did not mention the Taj Mahal in “Hamari Sanskritik Virasat” (Our Cultural Heritage), a part of the annual budget presented in the state assembly by the minister for finance Rajesh Agarwal. \nLast month, the state government omitted the reference to the Taj Mahal in a booklet published on the completion of six months of the Adityanath government. The move drew sharp criticism, prompting state tourism minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi to remark that the Taj Mahal was of great importance to the state government as well as the nation.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "9e503646_in", "news_id": "52fa2499eec732191bbfa654926cd839_in", "title": "Taj Mahal was built by blood and sweat of Indian labourers: CM Adityanath", "ts": 1508256534, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-was-built-by-blood-and-sweat-of-indian-labourers-cm-adityanath-says-taj-mahal-is-important/story-oCO4XrUYdW43RUu8NnI3CL.html"}

This is not about America giving dictation. We've described our strategy, we've described a very important role for Pakistan, who we see as a very important country in the region, but it's up to them whether or not they want to work with us on this strategy. And if they don't, as the Secretary said, we'll adjust accordingly,\" Wells said.\nDuring his just concluded visit to Pakistan, Tillerson stressed the importance of Pakistan \"moving quickly\" to demonstrate good faith and efforts to use its influence to create the conditions that will get the Taliban to the negotiating table.\n\"These are things that are seen and felt and measurable, and so we look forward over the next weeks and months to see the practical steps that Pakistan takes out of its own self- interest and ensuring that its own country is not destabilised by some of the actions of the groups that have been able to use its territory,\" she said.\n\"I can't give you an explicit timetable, but we're moving very quickly ourselves on our own strategy and in reinforcing on the military side our ability to demonstrate to the Taliban that they cannot win this war. We are going to make equally rapid progress on the diplomatic side or have equally-high expectations on the diplomatic side of responsiveness,\" she said.\nWells asserted that the Taliban leadership and the Haqqani Network still retain an ability to plan, to recuperate, and to reside with their families in Pakistan.\nThe Quetta and Peshawar leadership councils of the Taliban have their names for a reason, she noted.\n\"What we saw in 2014 was we saw Pakistan make a strategic decision to defeat the terrorist groups that were targeting the government of Pakistan. And with great loss of life, great courage, great vision about what needed to be done, Pakistan has fought that battle and now has regained control and sovereignty over the FATA territories,\" she said.\n\"We'd like to see the same strategic commitment brought against other militant groups, whether that are operating or have used Pakistan's territory, whether they are directed against India or directed against Afghanistan,\" she added.\nTillerson, during his meetings with Pakistani leadership, had an extremely candid conversation with the Prime Minister and the civilian and military leadership team, she said.\nThe Secretary underscored that the strategy is an opportunity; since Pakistan, with the exception of Afghanistan, has the most to benefit from a stable and peaceful country next door.\nHe noted that at several critical junctures over the last 70 years, the US has worked very closely with Pakistan, and the Coleman hostage is an example of what they can do when together.\n\"But under the strategy, we've laid out some very specific expectations of how Pakistan can help create the conditions that will help bring the Taliban to the table.And I think the longstanding relationships with the militant and terrorist organizations, our concern is that they threaten Pakistan's stability.\nYou see already the spillover of the sectarianism that has been building in Pakistan over the last several decades,\" she said.\nAccording to Wells, over the last four years Pakistani officials and the Taliban both thought the US was withdrawing.\n\"They were hedging against a chaotic departure. They were hedging against an uncertain security environment,\" she said.\n\"What the South Asia strategy gives them, is certainty that we're there, we're not going to let the Taliban win, that we're prepared to invest the resources that will be, at a minimum, a stalemate but a stalemate increasingly in the government's favor,\" she said. \n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "55d6f40e_in", "news_id": "cc664ff8db0614e1191fd70a47cc77f7_in", "title": "Fight against terrorism or we'll act soon, US threatens Pakistan", "ts": 1509334750, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/india/fight-against-terrorism-or-well-act-soon-us-threatens-pakistan-2052476.html"}

Besides the North Korea crisis, the polls also come at a time when the country is facing a sluggish economy which needs a boost.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "86063a6c_in", "news_id": "367a4818322f7165e5af88202c9b0883_in", "title": "Japan PM Shinzo Abe Announces Snap Polls Next Month Amid North Korea Crisis", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://www.india.com/news/world/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-announces-snap-polls-next-month-amid-north-korea-crisis-2496434/"}
1e7d044a_in	{"content": "The Tatkal service of Indian Railways has always been a convenient way of getting train tickets in the last minute. But the rules can be confusing. So here is everything you need to know about booking Tatkal tickets.\nPlanning a vacation soon? Or are you thinking of traveling back home for the holidays? Well, trains are the best way to get there, but with a 90-day booking window it is not at all uncommon to find train tickets booked a month or two before the intended journey. Thankfully, Indian Railways has a Tatkal service to book tickets at the last minute. We’ve covered the basic steps of booking Tatkal tickets online, but here is a more detailed look at the rules and timings of the scheme. \nSince its introduction in 1997, the Tatkal service has gone through some changes. For instance, the window for booking Tatkal tickets has fallen to just a day before the date of the journey. But the rush of booking tickets remains the same. Tatkal tickets get sold out within minutes of the window opening even to this day. Bookings for all AC class tickets open up at 10 am, while non-AC class tickets go up an hour later at 11 am. Here are some other rules of the Tatkal scheme.\n1. No concessions are allowed in ticket booking, and no refund is granted when cancelling confirmed tickets.\n2. You cannot get a refund if your waiting-list or RAC Tatkal ticket gets confirmed at any time up to the preparation of the final passenger chart.\n3. You can cancel your waiting-list or RAC Tatkal ticket for a refund at any time up to 30 minutes before your scheduled departure.\n4. In case you want to claim a refund for a train that is cancelled or more than three hours late, you need to file a Ticket Deposit Receipt (TDR) with the reason stated.\n5. If you have booked tickets for two or more passengers and not everyone has been confirmed, you can cancel everyone’s tickets, including the confirmed ones, for a refund up to 30 minutes before the departure.\n6. With ePayLater or Pay-on-Delivery, you can book your Tatkal tickets without paying money right then. Pay-on-Delivery lets you pay for the ticket once you get it, and ePayLater gives you a 14-day window.\n7. A word of caution; the ePayLater option requires you to register first. So complete the registration process before the Tatkal window opens. It can save you time, and time is crucial in getting your tickets booked. \nYou can book your Tatkal tickets on the IRCTC website, and the ePayLater system that was earlier reserved for non-Tatkal tickets is also available for the Tatkal scheme now. With this system, you can pay for your ticket up to 14 days after you book it.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "1e7d044a_in", "news_id": "ffd21e900374bf4b69cc246b19975184_in", "title": "Booking Tatkal Tickets: Rules and Timings for Booking Tatkal Tickets Online", "ts": 1507543307, "url": "http://www.india.com/travel/articles/tatkal-ticket-booking-2017-rules-and-timings-for-booking-tatkal-tickets-online/"}
1eb114ed_in	{"content": "Sometimes, a series of events points to a major upheaval.\nThis is exactly what is happening in Gujarat politics, leaving the ruling BJP bewildered and speechless.\nLess than 48 hours after the BJP celebrated two of Hardik Patel's key aides joining the fold, a number of young Patidar leaders have snapped ties with the BJP amid allegations of bribery.\nThen, OBC leader Alpesh Thakore joined Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in a massive show of strength on Monday afternoon.\nOn Saturday evening, BJP leaders were smiling from ear to ear as they were joined by Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leaders Varun Patel and Reshma Patel—believed to be close to Patel—before the media.\nHowever, Alpesh Thakore, the convenor of OBC Ekta Manch and president of Thakore Sena, announced he was joining the Congress after a meeting with party bigwigs Ahmed Patel and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi.\nOn Sunday evening, the BJP was in for a rude shock. Narendra Patel, PAAS convenor from north Gujarat, dropped a bombshell just hours after he joined the BJP: Alleging that the ruling party attempted to bribe him. Patel displayed wads of notes which were allegedly offered to him by BJP.\nTo see something like this in Narendra Modi’s Gujarat, and that too against the BJP, was stunning.\nNarendra alleged that Patidar leader Varun Patel, who joined the BJP on Saturday evening, took him to meet Gujarat BJP president Jitubhai Vaghani and other leaders on Sunday. He claims they gave him Rs 10 lakh as part of Rs 1 crore deal and said that Rs 90 lakh would be given to him on Monday.\nLast month, Narendra lodged a police complaint against Hardik and three supporters in Patan in north Gujarat, but withdrew it later.\nOn Monday, another young Patel face quit the BJP. Nikhil Sawani joined the BJP a fortnight ago after the BJP gave some assurances to the PAAS on reservations for the Patel community.\nSawani said he realised that the BJP was taking the community for a ride and could not stay with the party. \"I watched this from close quarters. The BJP is treating Patidars as a vote bank and what they had promised was a mere lollipop,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Patidar leader Atul Patel alleged that the BJP had offered him a bribe and claimed that he had this on tape.\nThakore, son of Congress veteran Khodaji Thakore of north Gujarat, controlled the crowd as if it was a classroom, silencing them and getting them to cheer wildly on cue.\nAmid conflicting media reports, confusion prevailed over whether or not Hardik met Rahul. However, Hardik, speaking to Firstpost, clarified that he didn't meet Rahul because he was tied up with his rallies and added that he was sure he would meet Rahul when he visited next time.\nHardik also mocked allegations that he was a Congress agent.\n“My fight is for the cause of the Patidars not for political ambitions, I am not joining the Congress party. My fight is against the BJP. I will work for the defeat of the ruling party which has only humiliated and insulted the Patidars. Our youngsters were killed and the police was unleashed on us. I can never support such a party.”\n“Those who were sold out and breached the trust of the community to join the BJP for personal ambitions and huge money are calling me a Congress agent? I don’t give a damn, I don’t bother who calls me what. I am what I am.”\n“I don’t need their certificate. My movement, my fight will continue as long as I have the backing of my people,” Hardik added.\nHardik's rallies across Gujarat are drawing large crowds, even as angry Patidars are burning the effigies of Varun and Reshma to protest them joining the BJP.\nHardik knows well that it is his independence from the Congress that gives him a strong political and moral credence to his movement among Patidars, which has been a loyal BJP vote bank for decades.\nDalit leader Jignesh Mevani, speaking to Firstpost, said: “I am not joining the Congress party. However, I am determined to defeat the BJP, not only in Gujarat in December 2017 but also in the 2019 general election. Dalits can never forget the atrocities and the insults meted out by the BJP.\"\n", "domain": "firstpost.com", "entry_id": "1eb114ed_in", "news_id": "3865be2b3075143a0e2e13c55836ee11_in", "title": "Congress and Patidar leaders deliver twin blows to BJP in Gujarat", "ts": 1508765855, "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/politics/gujarat-assembly-election-2017-congress-and-young-patidar-leaders-deliver-twin-blows-leave-bjp-dazed-and-confused-4167831.html"}

The politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) gave its nod to the recommendation of the West Bengal State Secretariat, seeking Banerjee's expulsion for breach of party discipline.\nA statement released by politburo member and party's West Bengal State Committee secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said that despite being warned and even suspended for his acts, the MP had failed to mend his ways and continued to tarnish the image of the party. \"Repeated efforts allowing him to correct himself failed. He continued tarnishing the image of the party\", the statement said.\nOn Wednesday, CPI(M) Bengal State Secretariat had recommended Banerjee's expulsion and a final decision was pending before the party's central leadership.

A three-member inquiry committee, headed by the party's Lok Sabha MP Mohd Salim, was also constituted to investigate the matter.\nRITUBRATA SPOKE OUT AGAINST CPM TOP BRASS\nWith disciplinary action imminent, Banerjee had spoken out against the party's central leadership, including former party general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo members Brinda Karat and Md Salim. \"Someone had to bell the cat. And I decided to bell it\", Banerjee had tweeted on Wednesday. \"Party is mine, party is yours, party doesn't belong to one,\" the MP lashed out on social media.\nThe 38-year-old parliamentarian had accused Karat of stonewalling re-nomination of party general secretary Sitaram Yechury to the Rajya Sabha for a third consecutive term. Accusing politburo member Md Salim and his son for spearheading a social media campaign against him, the rebel MP said that Salim had been inducted into the politburo purely under the Muslim quota.\nBanerjee is the latest in a growing list of high-profile leaders like former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, former Bengal minister Rezzak Mollah and Prasenjit Bose to have been expelled by the CPM in recent years.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "d5f2ec8c_in", "news_id": "a025299f2eb6160e72702344ba5a76c9_in", "title": "CPM Rajya Sabha MP Ritabrata Banerjee expelled from party", "ts": 1505490043, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cpm-rajya-sabha-mp-ritabrata-banerjee-expelled-anti-party-activities-yechury/1/1048654.html"}

I initially thought demonetisation move was going to curb black money and that people should bear with the problems during that transition.”\n The actor said many of his friends who understand economics criticised his stance. “I consoled myself, saying that while the plan was good, there may have been some problems with implementation,” he said.\n Haasan said that when more and more people voiced their anger, he had his doubts. “The sign of a good leader is to accept his/her mistake. Gandhi accepted his mistake and leaders today can also accept mistakes. If the PM accepts his mistake in this case, then I will salute him.”\n Haasan was among celebrities who had supported the demonetization scheme. \"Salute Mr Modi. This move has to be celebrated across political party lines. Most importantly by earnest taxpayers,” the actor had tweeted in November last year.\n This U-turn comes at a time when Haasan is all set to enter politics.

Haasan had met his fans in Chennai to chalk out a strategy and give it a final shape before his birthday.\n Talking about his high-profile meeting with Arvind Kejriwal, which many thought might be a sign of his aligning with the AAP, the ‘Hey Ram’ actor had said, “I did not go to Kejriwal, he came to me.

(Reuters Images)\nNew Delhi: The Indian cricket team are on the verge of creating history in the third match of the five-match series against Australia at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore on Saturday.\n A win for Virat Kohli's troops in this clash will be their ninth successive victory in the 50-over format of the game, which will be their longest winning streak in ODIs. \n Currently, team India find themselves on an 8-match win-streak — a feat that they have accomplished on four separate occasions previously (1985: Inclusive of the victory in the Benson & Hedges World Championship of Cricket ; 2003: Encapsulating their run to the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup ; 2006: Inclusive of a 4-match win streak over Pakistan, alongside victories over England ; 2013: Inclusive of a series victories over Zimbabwe (5-match).\n Also, an added incentive for the hosts is that they are on a 3-match win-streak against Australia, their joint-longest against this team. They won their last match of the 2016 bilateral 5-match ODI series at Sydney in addition to the two matches that they won in this series.\n India have managed three back-to-back victories on the trot against Australia (1994/95: In the Austral-Asia Cup, Singer World Series & New Zealand Centenary Tournament ; 1996 & 1998: Titan Cup and two matches of the Pepsi Triangular Series in Sharjah ; 2016 & 2017 : One in Australia and two in India). Thus, if they win, it will be India’s longest win-streak against Australia.\n Part records suggest that India will be confident of clinching a win in Indore and creating history as the hosts have never lost an ODI playing at this venue (Played: 4, Won: 4). While as for the visitors, they will be playing their first match at this venue and are unfamiliar with the conditions.   \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "8337372e_in", "news_id": "f813bfb098104fc735e71e90f3f3bb65_in", "title": "India vs Australia 2017: History Beckons Virat Kohli & Co Against Australia in Third ODI", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/history-beckons-virat-kohli-co-against-australia-in-third-odi-1526259.html"}

baa0476d_in	{"content": "नई दिल्ली, जेएनएन। भारत और न्यूजीलैंड के बीच दूसरा वनडे मैच देखने के उत्सुक खेल प्रेमियों के लिए बुरी खबर है। इस खबर को पढ़ने के बाद पुणे में होने वाले इस मैच को लेकर खेल प्रेमियों का रोमांच लगभग खत्म हो सकता है। इसकी वजह है पुणे की पिच। पुणे में फिर से पिच फिक्सिंग का जिन्न सामने आया है। \nपुणे में पिच तैयार करने वाले स्थानीय क्यूरेटर पांडुरंग सालगांवकर ने एक टीवी चैनल के स्टिंग में पिच के तमाम राज सामने रख दिए हैं। इंडिया टुडे के एक स्टिंग में दावा किया गया है कि सालगांवकार पैसे लेकर पिच का मिजाज बदलने को भी तैयार हो गए। \nएंटी करप्शन हेड देंगे रिपोर्ट \nइस मामले में बीसीसीआइ के कार्यवाहक अध्यक्ष सीके खन्ना ने बीसीसीआइ की एंटी करप्शन यूनिट के प्रमुख नीरज कुमार को खत लिखकर इस मामले पर नजर रखने को कहा है। वह इस मामले पर रिपोर्ट भी देंगे। इस मामले के खुलासे के बाद बीसीसीआइ के न्यूट्रल क्यूरेटर ने पुण की पिच की जांच की है और इसे खेलने के लिए ठीक करार दिया है। सीके खन्ना ने भरोसा जताया है कि मैच तय समय पर ही होगा। \nआरोपी क्यूरेटर हुए बर्खास्त\nइस मामले के खुलासे के बाद बीसीसीआइ के संयुक्त सचिव अमिताभ चौधरी ने कहा था कि मैच रद भी किया जा सकता है, हालांकि ऐसा हुआ नहीं। उन्होंने कहा कि इस मामले में लापरवाही बरतने वाले को बख्शा नहीं जाएगा। फिलहाल क्यूरेटर सालगांवकर को बर्खास्त कर दिया गया है। सीओए प्रमुख विनोद राय ने यह जानकारी दी। पहले उन्हें सस्पेंड किया गया था। राय ने कहा है कि इस मामले में विस्तृत रिपोर्ट मांगी गई है।\nPune pitch curator has been dismissed and his membership terminated: CoA Chief Vinod Rai\n— ANI (@ANI) October 25, 2017 \n खुल गए पिच के सारे राज \nस्टिंग के जरिए पता तला है कि इस मैच में पहली पारी में 337-340 रनों का स्कोर बनेगा और दूसरी पारी में खेलने वाली टीम इसे आसानी से चेज भी कर लेगी। यानी पिच का मिजाज, टॉस आने पर क्या करना चाहिए और मैच का नतीजा यानी लगभग सभी कुछ पहले से तय हो गया है। ऐसे में मैच में कोई रोमांच नहीं बचा रह गया है। \nस्टिंग में पांडुरंग से पूछा गया कि क्या पिच में कुछ बदलाव हो सकते हैं तो इस पर पांडुरंग ने जवाब दिया कि यह काम मुश्किल तो है, लेकिन वह केवल पांच मिनट में पिच को बदल सकते हैं। उन्होंने पिच पर कील वाले जूते पहनकर जाने की भी इजाजत दी, जिसे पहनकर खिलाड़ियों को भी पिच पर चलने नहीं दिया जाता है। \nपिच दिखाने को हुए तैयार\nयही नहीं, स्टिंग के दौरान पांडुरंग रिपोर्टर्स को पिच दिखाने के लिए भी तैयार हो गए। जबकि आइसीसी के नियमों के मुताबिक मैच से पहले पिच पर कप्तान और कोच से पहले कोई नहीं जा सकता और मैच से ठीक पहले टॉस के समय ही पिच को दोनों टीमों के कप्तान अच्छे तरीके से देखते हैं। इसलिए, टॉस होने के बाद ही टीमों में बदलाव की घोषणा की जाती है।\n'पैसे लेने को भी हुए तैयार'\nस्टिंग में दावा किया गया है कि पांडुरंग पैसों के लिए पिच बदलने को राजी भी हो गए थे। आपकी जानकारी के लिए बता दें कि क्यूरेटर पांडुरंग सलगांवकर खुद क्रिकेटर रहे हैं। वह अपने जमाने में तेज गेंदबाज रह चुके हैं। स्टिंग में कहा गया कि पिच के मिजाज की जानकारी बुकी को दी जाएगी, लेकिन पांडुरंग पर इसका कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ा। पैसों की बात करने पर पांडुरंग का कहना था कि पहले मैच देख लें, डील बाद में हो जाएगी। पैसे मैच खत्म होने के बाद दे देना। \nपहले भी निशाने पर रहे हैं पांडुरंग\nऐसा पहली बार नहीं है कि सालगांवकर निशाने पर आए हों। इससे पहले, भारत और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच इसी साल की शुरुआत में पुणे में हुए टेस्ट मैच में आइसीसी ने इसे काफी खराब पिच कहा था। भारतीय कप्तान विराट कोहली और ऑस्ट्रेलियाई टीम की ओर से भी इस पिच को लेकर शिकायत की गई थी। तब ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने भारत को 105 और 107 रनों पर आउट कर 333 रनों की बड़ी जीत हासिल की थी। यह मैच तीन दिन से पहले खत्म हो गया था। तब भी पांडुरंग ही पिच क्यूरेटर थे और इस मैच को लंदन से देखने भारत आए तत्कालीन बीसीसीआइ सचिव अजय शिर्के ने कहा था कि पिच फिक्सिंग की जांच सीबीआइ को करनी चाहिए। \nशिर्के ने कहा था, पागल है क्या पांडुरंग\nशिर्के ने कहा था कि यह पिच हमेशा से तेज गेंदबाजों के लिए मददगार रही है, लेकिन मैच के दौरान पिच में गड्ढे पड़ते देखे गए थे। उन्होंने पांडुरंग पर सवाल खड़े करते हुए कहा था कि क्या उसने पिच तैयार करते समय शराब पी ली थी? क्या वह पागल हो गया है? हालांकि, लगता नहीं है कि शिर्के की नाराजगी या भारत की इस बदनामी के बावजूद इस दिशा में कुछ किया गया हो। \nपढ़िए, स्टिंग की मुख्य बातचीत\nरिपोर्टर: X और Y दो लोग हमारे संपर्क में हैं। X के दो प्लेयर हैं। वो चाह रहे हैं, थोड़ा पिच में बाउंस हो जाए। उनको मदद मिल जाएगी, कल वाले मैच में?\nपांडुरंग: मिल जाएगा...!\nरिपोर्टर: मिल जाएगा?

कल को मैच है ही इंडिया-न्यूजीलैंड... आगे भी यहां कोई मैच होता है... जिस मैच को आप देखते हैं...\nपांडुरंग: ओके, हो जाएगा।\nरिपोर्टर: हम सिर्फ इतना चाहते हैं कि आप जो भी पिच इन्फर्मेशन है वो आप हमसे शेयर करें..\nपांडुरंग: ओके।\nरिपोर्टर: उस पर हम लोग जो भी बेटिंग करेंगे, जो भी बेनीफिट होगा, उसे हम लोग शेयर करेंगे।\nपांडुरंग: हां. ठीक है।\nरिपोर्टर: डन सर... बाकी कल हम लोग एक बार बात करेंगे।\n(अगली फुटेज में)\nरिपोर्टर: सर, आधे घंटे में पिच का नेचर भी चेंज हो सकता है?\nपांडुरंग: आधे घंटे में, 5 मिनट में चेंज हो सकता है। यह हमेशा मुश्किल और खतरनाक काम होता है।\nरिपोर्टर: ... तो ये 5 मिनट में कैसे नेचर चेंज हो जाएगा पिच का?\nपांडुरंग (पेपर पर दिखाते हुए): अरे, अभी देखो न ये विकेट है... ऐसे खप्ली एक निकाल दिया तो...\nरिपोर्टर: क्या निकाल दिया?\nपांडुरंग: खप्ली निकाल दिया।\nरिपोर्टर: घास?\nपांडुरंग: नहीं... खप्ली यानि थोड़ा गड्ढा (डैमेज) कर दिया...\nरिपोर्टर: मिट्टी जो है उसका... वो निकाल दिया...\nपांडुरंग: मिट्टी निकाल दिया तो क्या करोगे आप बोलो... कोई आकर गलती से, नहीं यह बोतल का पानी गिर गया... तो उससे भी पिच का नेचर चेंज हो जाएगा\nरिपोर्टर: उससे पिच का नेचर चेंज हो जाएगा?\nपांडुरंग: अरे... अभी जो कोई आया... आप आए और बूट रखा... उसमें ऐसा करके घुमाया, तो क्या हो गया... पिच तो डैमेज हो गया...।\n", "domain": "m.jagran.com", "entry_id": "baa0476d_in", "news_id": "4e6c1e428e2abcc918d9cc0e0d431684_in", "title": "जानें क्या रहेगा भारत vs न्यूजीलैंड मैच का नतीजा, 'पिच फिक्सिंग' से हुआ खुलासा", "ts": 1509072060, "url": "http://m.jagran.com/cricket/headlines-india-vs-new-zealand-2nd-odi-to-be-played-in-pune-alleged-to-be-fixed-in-a-sting-operation-16913476.html?src=p1"}

510c6467_in	{"content": "OnePlus is reportedly working on the successor of the 2017 flagship phone aka the OnePlus 5T. It is on Tuesday that a media invite was leaked which stated that OnePlus will be launching the OnePlus 5T on Nov 5. Soon after the report of OnePlus 5T launch started spreading like wild-fire, the company told GSMArena that the press invite is fake.\nOnePlus said that the press invite circulating on the internet about the OnePlus 5T is \"not a genuine invite\". This confirms that OnePlus 5T is not launching on November 5. Probably, the company will announce the device later in the year, atleast that's what is rumoured. However, OnePlus hasn't confirmed the coming or the OnePlus 5T as of yet.\nThe smartphone, which is to succeed the OnePlus 5, has been subjected to several leaks and rumours lately. Going by the rumoured specs, the upcoming OnePlus 5T is expected to come with narrow bezels on the sides and the top. Some rumours suggest that the device may sport an edge-to-edge display much like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Note 8.\nOnePlus 5T is tipped be an expensive phone. Atleast will be priced a few notches higher than the OnePlus 5 which comes with a price tag of Rs 32,999. That's about the pricing. Going by the specs, the OnePlus 5T is expected to come with Qualcomm's latest processor - Snapdragon 835. The same processor powers the OnePlus 5 as well. Furthermore, the OnePlus 5T is said to run on the latest Android Nougat software. Chances are that it may also come with Android 8 Oreo. This is because, OnePlus' last year's flagship phones - OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T beta testers are already getting the Oreo update.\nIn the imaging department, OnePlus 5T, as rumoured may come with dual rear camera set up like the OnePlus 5. The back camera will include one 20-megapixel sensor, while the second one will be 16-megapixel sensor. While on the front, the phone is expected to sport a 16-megapixel camera.\nOnePlus 5T is tipped to come in two variants. One with the 6GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage, while the second one will be a top-end version of the phone with 8 gigs of RAM and 128GB of inbuilt storage. The same variants were launched for the OnePlus 5, but then, in India only the 6GB RAM model was launched and is available.\nThese specs details, as of now should be taken with a pinch of salt as OnePlus is yet to confirm the coming of the OnePlus 5T. Some reports circulating on the web claim that OnePlus may skip the OnePlus 5T and launch the OnePlus 6 instead next year. However, nothing is known for certainty about the OnePlus 6, neither about the OnePlus 5T. \n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "510c6467_in", "news_id": "4e98d1c02aac111f5f4efc26b394fb35_in", "title": "OnePlus 5T will launch but not on Nov 5, invite is fake", "ts": 1508305859, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/oneplus-5t-will-launch-but-not-on-nov-5-invite-is-fake/1/1070876.html"}

Express photo by Praveen Khanna\nThe Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a circular outlining strict safety guidlines for schools affiliated to the board. Besides directing schools to install CCTV cameras on the premises, the Board has also asked them to carry out police verification of staff and control entry of outsiders.\nThe directives come in the wake of increasing safety concerns in schools after the recent murder of a seven-year-old boy at Ryan International School in Gurugram, and the alleged rape of a five-year-old girl in a Delhi school.\nIn the circular, CBSE clearly states that “the onus for safety and security of children in school campus shall solely lie upon the school authorities. It is a fundamental right of a child to engage and study in an environment where he/she feels safe and is free from any form of physical or emotional abuse or harassment”.\nHere are the CBSE’s guidelines for its schools\n1) The schools have to get the security /safety audit done on their premises and personnel from their respective local police station and follow the security related advice. This may be complied and reported online on CBSE website – cbse.nic.in within two months of receipt of this circular.\n 2) At all the vulnerable points, the school authority has to install CCTV cameras and ensure they are functional at all times.\n 3) They must get the police verification and psychometric evaluation done for all the staff employed. Such verification and evaluation for non-teaching staff like bus drivers, conductors, peon and other support staff may be done very carefully and in a detailed manner.\n 4) The supporting staff should be employed only from authorised agencies and proper records are maintained.\n 5) To constitute a parent-teacher-students committee to address the safety needs of the students and to take regular feedback from parents in this regard.\n 6) The access to school building by outsiders should be controlled and visitors monitored.\n 7) To provide training and development for staff to address their responsibilities to protect children from any form of abuse.\n 7) The school shall constitute separate committees for redressal of public/staff/parents/students grievances, Internal Complaints committee on sexual harassment and committees under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offence) Act, 2012 and details of the these committees along with contact details shall be displayed prominently on school notice board and conspicuously on the school website for information of all stakeholders.\nOn Wednesday, Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal asked Deputy Chief Minister and the Education Minister Manish Sisodia to make security measures suggested by police and other stakeholders compulsory for recognition of schools in the city.\nThe LG also directed the Delhi Police to waive verification charges for private schools in order to incentivise the process.\nHe had also suggested that the security measures suggested by the police and other stakeholders like DCPCR, CBSE to be considered for inclusion as a set of binding requirements for grant and continuation of recognition of schools under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules.\nNorth Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), the mayor said, “All school principals have been directed to ensure that staff members reach 15 minutes before the scheduled opening time and leave the premises 15 minutes after the students have left.

But, public can decipher the truth. Previously, rumours had to be spread by word of mouth, now Whatsapp helps those who wish to spread rumours, that is the difference.” \nPM Narendra Modi (Source: Express Photo/Renuka Puri)\nThe ruling BJP is looking at an audio clip of a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vadodara-based party worker Gopal Gohil on the day of Diwali as a morale booster for its cadre ahead of the Assembly elections. The party hopes that the telephonic conversation will help address the “negative sentiment” which is creeping in among the party workers due to the anti-BJP campaign launched by the Opposition.\nIn an audio clip of the conversation, Modi reminds Gohil of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s “maut ka saudagar (merchant of death)” jibe at him in the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Assembly polls, and assures the party worker that “public can decipher the truth”. The October 19 telephonic call, which has since gone viral, used the audio bridge conference technology, enabling around 20,000 BJP workers to listen to the conversation at once.\nThe clip has Modi calling up Gohil, a stationery store owner in Vadodara, who in the course of conversation asks the PM: “In the wake of incidents in Gujarat in the recent times and the anti-BJP campaign by the Congress, what can be done to bring the party workers out of the resulting negative mindset?” Modi’s three-minute reply to Gohil is a pep talk where he says, “Look brother, ever since the Jan Sangh was born and we became part of it, we have been destined to be abused. We have been hurled with abuses, and (yet) reached where we are. So, you should not worry about it.”\nGohil conscientiously agrees with the PM, who goes on to say, “Tame mane kaho, ek bhi chutni joi che.. jhoothana nathi chaalya hoy…Maut no saudagar… ena thi mota- hatyara, lohi thi khardayela haath, su su na kehvayu… pan janta satya no ranko samajhti hoy che… pehla afvaao kaano kaan felavi padti thi… havey Whatsapp madad kare afvaa felavava maa… (You tell me, has there been any election when lies were not spread? They called me maut ka saudagar (merchant of death)… even worse… they called me a murderer and someone whose hands are stained with blood. But, public can decipher the truth. Previously, rumours had to be spread by word of mouth, now Whatsapp helps those who wish to spread rumours, that is the difference.)\nOn Wednesday, Modi, acknowledging the “conversation”, had tweeted, “Have always known Gopalbhai as a wonderful person and now the nation too knows him :).” When contacted, Gohil, 47, told The Indian Express he had met Modi once during the Sadbhavna rally in Gandhinagar in 2011 when he was chief minister, and “had shaken hands with him”. Gohil said: “I and my family have been blessed to be chosen for this conversation with Modiji. I know, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us. I was told to stay connected to the conference, but I had not expected that my number would be randomly selected for this conversation. I am thrilled.”\nGohil said his question stemmed from what he has been observing around him. He said, “I wanted to ask Modiji what he thinks about this anti-BJP campaign and the Patidar issues that are maligning the image of the party and the leadership. It is affecting the morale of the workers and therefore, I wanted him to show us a path, which he did. This conversation has given a fresh boost to our commitment to the party. It has turned me into a celebrity as many party colleagues have been calling to congratulate me.”\nAccording to BJP leaders, the conversation is part of a new exercise by the party to re-group its workers, who are falling into a “negativity” due to an intense campaign by the opposition in Gujarat. In coming days, the PM will directly address the party workers through a video conference, allaying concerns of the cadre, they said.\nThe telephonic conversation begins with Gohil and Modi exchanging greetings for Diwali, after which, he poses the question to the Prime Minister. Modi goes on to tell Gohil, and around 20,000 party workers listening to the conversation that they must “not waste their time” worrying about the anti-BJP campaign, gossip, and lies spread by others, and instead, they should “concentrate on spreading the word of truth”. Modi says, “We have given our blood and sweat for welfare of the people. The BJP has been in power for so long that these people have no credibility to make allegations against us. We are on a strong wicket. We must only take our good work to people.”\nA senior party functionary said, “Over the last few weeks, we have observed during our internal meetings that party workers are questioning the strength of the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls. The blitz of public rallies by opposition parties as well as fringe caste leaders, and the response that their rallies are getting have caused a bit of negativity to seep into the cadre. This situation was further aggravated when an internal report received by the party from ground agencies indicated an anti-incumbency. So, the high command decided that Modiji will reach out to the party workers to instil confidence in them once again.”\nThe leader added that the party was confident of a grand victory in December. “This is just a passing phase. We have no doubt that our performance will be splendid in the polls.” As part of the exercise, Modi will continue to make “phone calls” to party leaders at various levels of hierarchy. Vadodara BJP general secretary Keyur Rokadia said that the party will make use of the audio bridge conference technology, enabling the PM to connect with thousands of party workers through a single phone call.\nThose connected to the conference call can hear Modi’s conversation with one worker, who is “randomly selected”, as in case of Gohil. Rokadia said, “The party has database of 25,000 phone numbers at various levels — state, district, city, ward and booth. Modiji spoke with eight people on that day, including two district-level leaders, two ward members and three booth-level workers. This exercise will continue in the days to come through the audio bridge technology.”\nRokadia, who was connected to one of the phone conferences on October 19, added, “He (Modi) gave an encouraging talk to the listeners and then a random number was chosen to ask a question…” Rokadia denied that the questions asked by the party workers had been vetted. Rokadia said, “The aim of the exercise is to allow party workers to ask questions from Modiji directly. These are questions that the party workers are facing. They want to ask Narendrabhai the questions. In the coming days, there will also be video bridge sessions with party workers through the Narendra Modi App.”\nVideo of the day\nRoad Route For Coal: Choked Lungs, Homes & Trees\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "ac0d9690_in", "news_id": "e6b8a517f308db7fbd07a7bd6a971e83_in", "title": "PM Modi talks ‘maut ka saudagar’ with BJP worker, party banks on his phone calls", "ts": 1509334750, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/elections/gujarat-assembly-elections-2017/in-pm-narendra-modi-pep-talk-to-party-man-bjp-sees-cadre-morale-booster-4908319/"}

Now with Bharat 2 Ultra smartphone, Micromax is clearly aiming at the segment of Indian population who still cannot afford to switch from a feature phone to a smartphone.

I think, one of the greatest success of demonetisation was that the prime minister and the team -- obviously the RBI was involved, the finance minister was involved - kept it a closely guarded secret,\" he said. \n \"Otherwise in a process where a decision is taken, alternate currency is printed, thousands of people involved in the printing do not know why they are doing it, the currency is collected, tabulated and sent to the currency chest and one has to be ready with the alternate currency the moment it is demonetised and still we were able to keep it a closely guarded secret,\" he said. \n Emphasising that the implementation of demonetisation was a \"success\", Jaitley said, \"There were no single public unrest in its immediate aftermath\". \n \"This was the largest ever currency replacement exercise. There was inconvenience. Television reporters went and provoked people outside the banks, but still people said that though they were feeling the pinch of it, it was a good move and they support it,\" the minister said. \n Demonetisation had a lot of popular support, Jaitley said, adding that as a result of its implementation the government managed a large part of the cash currency. \n \"Digital transactions have doubled. A large number of people have joined the tax net,\" he said. \n Jaitley said consistent steps had been taken to formalise and expand the more formal economy. \n \"And wanting to formalise that economy, one after the other steps are taken against shadow economy,\" he said. \n \"Some of these steps, the demonetisation, the GST because the GST could lead to de-stocking of existing stocks can have for a quarter or so a transient impact on manufacturing,\" he said. \n Referring to the series of economic reforms that India has undertaken since 1991, Jaitley said the Indian model now seems to be emerging. \n Jaitley said there was a consensus on reforms in India. He said the government had convinced the people that domestic investment was grossly inadequate. \n \"What you require is an additionality of evidence. And therefore, you have to create an environment in India where people find India a friendly place to invest in,\" he said as he described the key hurdles in the process. \n \"India has opened up in sectors where there was a scope for opening up. And not in a single case the government faced a protest,\" he said. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "d1cd0814_in", "news_id": "6506464f2c2e0137b81303db85b4d07b_in", "title": "Arun Jaitley says transparency over note ban would have been instrument of fraud", "ts": 1507718632, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/arun-jaitley-says-transparency-over-note-ban-would-have-been-instrument-of-fraud/articleshow/61034434.cms"}

(Source: File)\nCricket’s biggest draw, the India-Pakistan bilateral series, is not expected to be part of ICC’s recently launched Test championship that is set to start after the 2019 World Cup. With no clarity on the Indian government giving the BCCI the go ahead to play with its neighbours, the ICC, it is learnt, is not expected to slot any India-Pakistan Test series in the Future Tours Programme (FTP) draft that it is working on. The BCCI had explained their stand vis-à-vis playing Pakistan in the ICC meeting in Auckland earlier this month.\nThe format of the Test championship has nine teams playing six series over the two-year period — three each home and away — with each series having a minimum of two Tests and a maximum of five.\nThe top two teams will contest a play-off final to determine the Test champions in England in June 2021. In case, India and Pakistan do make it to the final, the chance of the two arch rival playing the title contest are high since that would be seen as an ICC event. Over the years, India has continued to play Pakistan in ICC events despite the bilateral impasse. “As per the Test championship draft, it says, a Test team has to play with six Test playing nations in four year cycle. So India can play with Australia, England, South Africa, West Indies, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Test championship cycle. It leaves no window for us with Pakistan. The board can’t do anything other than requesting Indian government. The day government gives clearance we are ready to play. At the moment India will not play Pakistan in Test championship,” a top BCCI official told The Indian Express.\nIt is learnt that PCB wanted India to play 24 games in this cycle but the BCCI declined stating the issue is not in their hands. The board has also ruled out series at neutral venues with Pakistan. At the same time they have agreed to play against Pakistan in any of the ICC tournaments. However, the Indian board is looking at the new Test championship as the model of Big Three where India, England and Australia would decide whom to play in their cricketing calendar. It remains to be seen how this plays out in reality. The ICC also approved the trial of four-day Tests if both sides agree but all Test championship matches will be five-day contests.\nVideo of the day\nFinding Patrick Patterson: The Menacing West Indian Bowler Who Disappeared 25 Years Ago\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "85b50f5a_in", "news_id": "01b4226b76434edcd764ada736f8ed45_in", "title": "India vs Pakistan bilateral series unlikely in ICC Test Championship", "ts": 1508748729, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-pakistan-bilateral-series-unlikely-in-icc-test-championship-4901931/"}
7c0ce632_in	{"content": "The BJP's first duo, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, face one of their toughest electoral battles as they seek to protect their home turf from a resurgent opposition.\nWill BJP be able to protect their home turf?\nOn October 16, members of a spiritual movement called Divine Life Mission gathered for a satsang in Eral village. The venue was the haveli of Harvardhan Singh Chauhan, the erstwhile Thakur of the village. After the satsang, the conversation drifted towards politics. The village is in central Gujarat, a BJP bastion, so Chauhan didn't expect any surprises when he asked the knot of 15 villagers, including farmers, about the likely result of the coming assembly election. The ambivalent reply shocked him. \"Let's see what's in store this time,\" a member of the group said.\nWhen Chauhan insisted the BJP's formidable election machinery and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would see them through, one of the farmers shot back: \"But he's not going to lead the Gujarat government.\" The rest of the group nodded their heads in silence. \"It is this silence that is worrying for the BJP,\" Chauhan says.\nIt is a worry that is reflected in Prime Minister Modi's frequent trips to Gujarat - eight in the past five months. Like an indulgent parent making up for his absence, Modi has been on a gifting spree. He has announced or inaugurated projects worth over Rs 20,000 crore, not counting the Rs 1.1 lakh crore Ahmedabad - Mumbai high speed rail, the foundation stone for which was laid on September 14. It didn't stop there: there was the Sardar Sarovar dam project dedicated to the nation and also the inauguration of the first phase of the Rs 615 crore roll-on, roll-off ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej.\nTo call Gujarat the mother of all battles for both the BJP and the Congress would not be a misnomer. Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah face their biggest test over the next few weeks all the way up to the two-phase elections finally scheduled for December 9 and 14. Anti-incumbency will play a part; after all, the BJP has been in power in the state for 22 years (since 1995). And now there is the discontent over the Centre's twin economic moves - demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nOn the face of it, things still look good for the BJP. An india today-Axis My India Opinion Poll conducted between September 25 and October 15 in all 182 constituencies of the state shows the BJP bagging 115 - 125 seats. This is in the same range as the party's performance in the 2007 and 2012 assembly elections. The Congress is projected to win 57 - 65 seats; in 2012, it had bagged 60 seats.\nBut on the ground, the mood is less upbeat. The BJP is battling more than just anti-incumbency or Modi's absence from state politics. A new opposition front led by three caste leaders -- Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakore and Jignesh Mevani -- is giving state BJP leaders sleepless nights. Sixty-five per cent of the state's 43.2 million electorate is under the age of 35, and this troika from the Patidar, OBC Kshatriya and Dalit communities has not just captured the imagination of the youth, but has also thrown in its lot with the Congress. The Congress itself has been resurgent with vice-president Rahul Gandhi leading the charge and landing a volley of punches on the ruling party.\nRahul Gandhi has seen impressive crowds at his rallies in central Gujarat and Saurashtra. And he has successfully tapped into the popular disenchantment with the government's big bang reforms, such as GST. The BJP strategy has been to carpet-bomb the electorate with development rhetoric, the now familiar narrative of the state's transformation over the past 22 years. Except, this rhetoric will be lost on the nearly five million first-time voters born after 1995 who have no memory of a time when the Congress ruled the state.\nFor the Congress, a fourth consecutive loss in Gujarat will only add to its declining fortunes. Winning, however, could reinvigorate the party ahead of the multiple state elections due in 2018 and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. And this is where the party has put the BJP on the defensive by playing up the bogey of tanashahi (autocratic rule), propping up caste equations, even playing the soft Hindutva card. While the BJP has a 48 per cent vote share and the Congress 38 per cent, the three new leaders in the mix could play a crucial role in swing seats. There has been a difference of 10 - 11 per cent between the votes polled by the BJP and the Congress in the past three assembly polls since 2002. A six per cent swing in the Congress's favour could upset the BJP applecart.\n\"Clearly, the BJP isn't getting the state on a platter this time,\" says Ketan Trivedi, political analyst with Gujarati magazine Chitralekha. \"This time, it looks like it has its back to the wall.\" How rapidly the electoral landscape is changing was evident from the developments over two days after Diwali. On October 20, the start of the Gujarati New Year, the Congress offered tickets to the three young Turks - Patidar agitation leader Hardik Patel, emerging Dalit icon Jignesh Mevani and OBC leader Alpesh Thakore. Only Thakore, a social worker from the powerful OBC Kshatriya caste that forms over 26 per cent of the electorate in Gujarat, accepted. Thakore had become a hero in his community by running an anti-liquor reform movement under the banner of the Gujarat Thakore Sena. The change of heart came after a meeting with Rahul Gandhi in Delhi.\nThe opposition has played the strategem of being the underdogs pitted against the BJP's moneybags. Leaders of Hardik's Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) have alleged that they have received offers from Rs 1-10 crore to join the BJP, allegations that seem credible in the light of the party's attempt to entice Congress MLAs during Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha election in August. Hardik has lost no time rubbing it in. \"We are a social movement. We can't pay like the BJP. Our fight is for justice, for reservation for the Patel community and against the political arrogance of the BJP,\" he says.\nTHE BJP's MODI STRATEGY\nThere is still a month-and-a-half to go for the polls and the BJP's star campaigner Narendra Modi has just hit the campaign trail. The party believes the Modi effect will get it past the post. The initial reports have enthused them. Modi's roadshow in Vadodara on October 22 and his Gujarat Gaurav Sammelan in Ahmedabad drew an enthusiastic response.\nIndeed, most analysts believe that although the BJP faces a stiff challenge, it is unlikely to lose. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is dismissive of the Congress: \"Before every election, it tries to whip up anti-BJP sentiment and then bites the dust.\" The BJP and Amit Shah's 150-seat target is based on sound logic, he explains, trotting out some numbers. The party led in 165 of the 182 assembly segments in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and it swept all 26 seats. \"It was the impact of Narendrabhai as PM candidate,\" he says. \"And today, he is PM, an unblemished PM who has given India's cleanest government in years.\" Apart from Modi, the party is banking on Shah's strategy, the party's organisational strength, the gaurav yatras led by state BJP president Jitu Vaghani and deputy CM Nitin Patel that covered 5,000 km with the slogan, 'Hun chhun vikas, hun chhun Gujarat (I am Development, I am Gujarat)', to work their magic.\nThe party's booth management structure is its biggest strength and an area where the Congress is at its weakest. A network of vistaraks (party expanders) handle each of the 48,000 booths in the state. The BJP has another ace up its sleeve. It is reportedly planning to offer a ticket to former Gujarat encounter cop DG Vanzara. The retired deputy inspector general of police, the main accused in a series of alleged extra-judicial 'encounter' killings, was in jail for seven years till 2015. Vanzara's entry could be a game changer, for it will bring the nationalism vs anti-nationalism debate centrestage. Vanzara is well respected among Gujarat's Hindu electorate who see him as a 'patriot' jailed for a \"nationalist cause\". \"Vanzara can draw as much crowds as Hardik once he steps out as a political leader,\" says a BJP leader.\nBJP state spokesperson Bharat Pandya dismisses any threat from the new troika. \"These three are as apart in their objectives as chalk and cheese. It's an alliance based on just one thing -- hatred for the BJP -- and so it will never succeed,\" he says. However, rising prices and the problems caused by the GST are troubling the BJP in many pockets, with the party not doing enough to remove the doubts of the small businessmen. The party has also not been able to fully arrest the drift it witnessed soon after Modi left Gujarat. It had manifested itself in the mismanaged handling of the 2015 pro-Patel reservation agitation and then the BJP's defeat in the district and taluka panchayat polls at the Congress's hands. However, the party has won all the seven big and small polls held since 2015. The party's biggest challenge is how to tackle \"crowd magnets\" Hardik and Alpesh. Hardik has caught the imagination of the Patel youth by playing on their sentiments and invoking the 10 Patel youths who died during the violent 2015 agitations.\nMuch will also depend on ticket distribution. To win, the BJP will have to drop at least a third of its 120 MLAs, particularly the Patel MLAs targeted by Hardik. Though Patels are only between 12 and 15 per cent of the electorate, 44 BJP MLAs are from the community. There are 10 Patel ministers in Rupani's cabinet. One strategy for the BJP is to depend on the OBC Kshatriyas and other backward community sections in constituencies where Patels are under Hardik's influence. There, the BJP has to give tickets to non-Patels.\nVeteran political analyst Vidyut Thakar lays out three factors which favour the BJP despite the adverse political atmosphere: \"PM Modi, the BJP's unmatched election machinery and a committed 25 per cent votebase. The BJP could get 125 seats.\" Shah says \"the work our government has done on providing water, 24-hour power and in law and order cannot be erased from public memory. We are on a very strong wicket. If the Congress plays its caste card, it will see itself sinking in quicksand\".\nRESURGENT CONGRESS\nOn October 9, Rahul Gandhi delivered a moving speech to a crowd of intellectuals, businessmen and professionals in Vadodara. It drew quite a favourable response. The Nehru-Gandhi scion spoke out against the BJP's highhandedness, manifested in slogans like 'Congress mukt Bharat'. \"Everyone has a right to be in politics,\" he said. \"Why should anyone think of erasing others from politics? We in the Congress never think in such negative terms.\"\nSignificantly, Rahul Gandhi's public meetings during his visit to central Gujarat in the second week of October drew good crowds, sometimes drawing huge ones like in Borsad, Petlad and Phagvel. The Phagvel rally was particularly noteworthy. The pilgrim centre is surrounded by the assembly seats of three of the 14 Congress MLAs who left the party at the BJP's bidding in July-Shankersinh Vaghela, Ram Singh Parmar and Man Singh Chauhan. The last two have since joined the saffron party. The turnout could be an indicator of the public mood, perhaps showing that the public disapproved of the politics of defection played by the BJP.\nIn the 2007 and 2012 elections, the Congress party lacked a strong state leader to counter the Modi aura. Five years later, it still lacks one, but it sees a glimmer of hope of victory in a series of events - the absence of PM Modi from the state and the growing discontent with the BJP.\nFor the first time, the party is also unabashedly playing the soft Hindutva card. The Congress has not raised the issue of injustice to Muslims by Modi and the BJP. Rahul has also visited a series of temples on his last two trips, starting with Dwarka and a trek up to the hilltop Chotila shrine. State Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki has even demanded a countrywide ban on cow slaughter. The message is clear - the Congress is no more a party just for minorities. The challenge, however, is to convince the voters.\nThe Congress has also played up the tanashahi charge against the BJP. Hardik Patel was jailed in 2015 for 'waging war against the state' and banished from Gujarat. Bharatsinh Solanki describes the case of a businessman and party ticket contender from Vadodara who, after being threatened, skipped a meeting with Rahul Gandhi. \"Such high-handedness is only going to strengthen the resolve of the people to throw the BJP out,\" he says. \"The arrogance of being in power for 22 years is clearly showing,\" says senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil, who played a pivotal role in Ahmed Patel's surprise Rajya Sabha victory. \"The state government is insensitive and high-handed. The BJP is in no position to form the government this time.\"\nIn the six months since the Congress launched its Gujarat campaign, it has focused its strategy purely on winning the elections. In September, the party decided a candidate's winnability would be the prime criterion for a ticket even if it meant lateral entry of outsiders - a straight lift from the BJP playbook. In May, former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot was made general secretary in-charge of Gujarat. Disgruntled veteran Shankersinh Vaghela's veiled threats of rejoining the BJP were ignored (he finally left the party).\nOffering seats to Hardik, Jignesh and Alpesh was part of its strategy of forming a grand alliance against the BJP. The challenge for the party is to accommodate Alpesh and Hardik on the same platform-the former's OBC Kshatriya bloc is opposed to the Patels in the villages.\nA combination of agrarian stress and the Hardik-led popular movement may dent the BJP's Patel votebank that swept it to power in 1995. The Congress has discarded its 1980s strategy of wooing Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi and Muslims, the so-called 'KHAM' formula, and also resisted projecting Bharatsinh Solanki as a CM candidate as his father Madhavsinh Solanki was the architect of the formula, which it believes alienated the party from the Patidars.\nModi has made the BJP a more inclusive party, making inroads into most communities, including the Muslims (the party got 22 per cent of their vote in 2012). The Congress is trying to capitalise on the Patel-BJP rift by wooing community leaders. It has deployed Siddharthbhai Patel, son of ex-CM Chimanbhai Patel, to do the spadework.\nWith Alpesh formally joining the Congress, the party will be banking on the over 26 per cent OBC Kshatriya votes in the state. The Congress also hopes to gain the support of the state's 7 per cent Dalit population. In the 13 constituencies reserved for Dalits, the BJP performed better than the Congress in the last three polls. But the Una incident of last year, where seven Dalits were flogged for skinning a dead cow, could change all that. Interestingly, Una has been a Congress seat for the past 15 years. A CSDS survey says the party increased its vote share among Scheduled Tribes from 56 per cent in 2007 to 65 per cent in 2012.\nThe Congress campaign in Gujarat also received a major boost in May with Kannada actor Divya Spandana, popularly known as Ramya, being made head of the social media team. The team racked up some impressive successes against the BJP-a 'Vikas Gone Crazy' campaign lampooning the vikas plank provoked ripostes from PM Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley. It even had the saffron party crafting a new 'I am Vikas, I am Gujarat' counter-campaign.\nThe party has empowered local leaders to help with ticket distribution. Siddharthbhai is chairman of the campaign committee and Madhusudan Mistry heads the manifesto committee. Shaktisinh Gohil is chairman of the election media committee. It has even borrowed Amit Shah's tactics to mobilise booth volunteers to help get dedicated voters.\nThe real challenge for the Congress is to woo the urban voter. In a state like Gujarat, with 42 per cent urban population, the BJP has a stranglehold on 110 urban and semi-urban seats. Issues like water, electricity, and the struggles of farmers or tribals don't exist in the cities. In 2012, the BJP managed a near-clean sweep, winning 42 of the 46 seats in Surat, Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.\nOne urban strategy is to catch student/ youth voters who can play key roles in this election. The Congress has been campaigning in colleges and professional institutes and holding ward-level meetings in urban and semi-urban assembly seats. The plan is to corner the Rupani government and PM Modi on issues like campus violence, high cost of private education and the deteriorating standards of government institutes.\nThis is all part of a multi-pronged strategy. The party's election manifesto has promised 16 hours of power supply instead of the eight hours now to the agriculture sector and also a loan waiver to the farmers. Says Bharatsinh, \"There is unrest in all sections of society because of the BJP's tanashahi and mismanagement. They talk about GDP, we talk about happiness index which is what is needed.\" No wonder then, the Congress slogan is: 'Congress aave chhe, navsarjan laave chhe (Congress is coming, and coming with a new order)' and 'Khush rahe Gujarat (Let Gujarat be happy)'.\nBut as in the BJP, much will depend on ticket distribution. In past elections, there have been allegations of tickets being sold. But this time, with two no-nonsense, clean men at the helm in Solanki and Gohil, this is no longer a possibility. While distributing tickets, keeping the caste factor in mind will be a challenge as the Patels, whom it is now wooing, have traditionally kept away from the party. With Hardik's alleged 'understanding' with the Congress, it might give more tickets to Patels this time on the promise that he will help them win. But herein lies the catch: doing this could scare away traditional voters, like the OBC Kshatriyas. Says Thakar: \"The big challenge in the Congress strategy is wooing both Patels and Thakores, who are opposed to each other.\"\nThen there is the problem of oneupmanship. The departure of Vaghela has helped the Congress as it has brought some sanity and a break from the constant infighting when he was present. But one-upmanship remains. It is said of the Gujarat Congress that there are more leaders in the party than workers. The PCC has one executive president in Bharat Solanki and four other working presidents. It also has 47 secretaries, 24 general secretaries and 17 vice-presidents.\nTHE SPOILERS\nA whole host of new political leaders and one old stalwart have upended the traditional straight fight between the Congress and the BJP. There is Vaghela, of course, who left the Congress in July and then hijacked 13 more party MLAs and voted against the Congress in the subsequent Rajya Sabha polls. Vaghela's newly-floated Janvikalp Party is believed to have the BJP's tacit support and will field candidates in all 182 constituencies. It could cut into the Congress's OBC Kshatriya votes.\nBut while the Congress has only one spoiler to look out for, the BJP has three. It fears the troika of Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakore more than it does the Congress. But it also gives the party an opportunity, however feeble, to play victim, projecting their coming together as an unprincipled alliance. In previous elections, PM Modi would project himself as the victim of anti-Hindutva forces. The meteoric rise of the trio has coincided with Modi's departure from Gujarat. BJP leaders say such figures could not have risen if Modi had been in the state. Both Hardik, 23, and Alpesh, 42, are from Viramgam, a historic town 60 km west of Ahmedabad famous since early medieval Solanki-era lake. Interestingly, both know each other well. Alpesh's father Khodaji Thakore had left the BJP along with his leader Shankersinh Vaghela and joined the Congress in 1995. In 2014, after the success of his anti-liquor campaign with the Gujarat Thakore Sena, Alpesh formed the OSS (OBC-SC-ST) Ekta Manch to take up the problems of farmers and unemployed youth, before joining the Congress last week. His campaign had forced the Gujarat government to strengthen the state's anti-liquor laws in 2016.\nThe Congress, however, won't be able to take advantage of Alpesh if it doesn't handle its ticket distribution skillfully. Analysts feel that Hardik may be a more formidable political factor than Alpesh because although he is from a smaller community, he has a committed following among the youngsters in his community. In fact, Hardik has divided the Patidars along age lines - the older Patels feel the community has progressed under the BJP. The youth are with Hardik.\nHardik has enjoyed a fairy tale ascent. It all started when his sister faced problems in getting admission in Ahmedabad despite having good marks. He then took a vow that he would win OBC reservation status for the Patel community. After his first rally in Visnagar in north Gujarat in July 2015, he soon floated PAAS, his own independent organisation.\nPatel owes his rise to the unprovoked beating of PAAS members by police after a mega rally in August 2015. In the subsequent violence, 10 Patel boys and a couple of policemen were killed. Charged with waging war against the nation, he was externed from Gujarat and imprisoned for nine months. Meanwhile, the state announced 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward classes (EBC), a decision which was challenged in court in the light of the Supreme Court cap of 49 per cent reservation. Hardik remained adamant resulting in the exit of Anandiben Patel as CM, following the BJP's losses in the district and taluka panchayat polls in 2015. Last month, the government withdrew the police cases against PAAS members. Hardik continues to draw huge crowds of Patel youth giving the jitters to BJP leaders and has apparently drawn up a plan to defeat the party's Patel MLAs in the coming elections.\nJignesh Mevani, 34, a lawyer-cum-Dalit activist from a village near Mehsana in north Gujarat, could be the peripheral player among the trio, even though he is very articulate. This is because Dalits are only 7.5 per cent of the population in Gujarat and a significant number of them are already with the Congress. His strength, however, lies in his ability to raise an anti-BJP coalition. Mevani's connect with the Dalit Samaj after the Una incident is intense as he had toured the Dalit areas across the state after the incident, even taking out a statewide Dalit asmita (pride) rally where 20,000 Dalits vowed to leave their traditional profession of skinning dead animals. A new political leader was born. Worryingly for the BJP, these spoilers could be the game changers in Gujarat.\n(with Kaushik Deka)\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "7c0ce632_in", "news_id": "0aa470cb1496846d6b3eb30a51d76fec_in", "title": "Battle for Gujarat: Will Modi-Shah be able to protect their home turf?", "ts": 1509334750, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gujarat-elections-narendra-modi-amit-shah-bjp-rahul-gandhi/1/1075598.html"}

e0efa0f4_in	{"content": "The results of Monday's snap election are in and according to reports, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's Left Democratic Party (along with its junior coalition partner, the Komeito) is believed to have secured at least 312 seats in the House of Representatives. This is of significance because it means that Abe's alliance now holds a two-thirds majority in both houses of Japan's bicameral legislature, known as the National Diet. The ruling coalition already has a two-thirds majority in the House of Councillors, the less powerful upper house.\nHaving a so-called 'supermajority' (two-thirds) in both Houses gives them virtually a free hand to push even divisive policies and legislation. Abe, it must be noted, pointed out soon after his massive victory that he would not use his 'supermajority' to push through constitutional changes through Parliament. The note of caution seems appropriate considering the whirlwind few months the prime minister has had.\nShinzo Abe, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, answers a question from a reporter during a TV interview. AP\nWith the win, Abe has bounced back from the summer, when his support ratings plunged to 30 percent after accusations of government favoritism to people connected to him. For the first time since he took office nearly five years ago, he appeared vulnerable as both party leader and prime minister.\nThe ruling coalition's victory, though, reflects as much the lack of viable alternatives as support for Abe, a fact that he seemed to acknowledge in post-election comments. Voter turnout stood at just 54 percent, as typhoon rains lashed much of the country.\nNevertheless, now that the ruling coalition has secured its foothold for the near future, there are a few things to consider.\nFirst, Japan and the region will see a continuation of policy from Tokyo. As Abe told NHK, \"I think the results reflected the voters' preference for a solid political foundation and their expectations for us to push polices forward and achieve results.\" Domestic implications aside, what this means is that Japan's position on China is likely to be unchanged.\nA look at South Korea — the other US treaty ally in the region that faces somewhat similar issues — after the impeachment of Park Geun-hye is instructive. President Moon Jae-in appears to be changing Seoul's equations with Washington and Beijing. As South China Morning Post points out, \"Park was more pro-US in her diplomacy, but had forged a good working relationship with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Moon vowed to pursue a more independent foreign policy and to redefine Seoul’s relations with both powers, suggesting he was likely to take a more accommodating position towards China and keep distance from Washington.\"\nBy claiming the majority, it is expected that Abe will stick to his China policy.\nSecond and on a similar note, even as South Korea has wavered in its approach to North Korea with Moon's 'dual-track' policy of seeking Pyongyang's denuclearisation coupled with a call for dialogue, the majority in the General Election will allow Abe to stick to his guns.\nThird, there's the prickly issue of seeking an amendment to the Constitution, particularly Article IX that reads:\nAspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognised.\nEver since Abe came to power in December 2012, he has been at the forefront of an effort to get Japan to move away from its pacifist interpretation of the Constitution. However, making any amendment to the Constitution is a tricky business in Japan. The first step is to secure a two-thirds majority in both Houses of the Diet and the second entails putting the motion up for a public referendum. With China's expansionism in the South China Sea and North Korea's belligerence in the region, it is imperative that Japan be able to defend itself. And even though Abe has stated he will not use the majority to push through constitutional amendments, this resolve will likely hold only for a brief while.\nWhether or not the people of Japan give Abe the support he needs to fix Article IX remains to be seen.\nFor India, Abe's consolidation of power augurs well, because New Delhi can work with him on a variety of levels. From trade to infrastructure and strategy to defence, Abe — chief guest at India's 65th Republic Day parade — has so far been a reliable partner to India.\nIn July, Japan finally provided all the approvals needed to set the India-Japan nuclear deal in motion. Abe was also in India recently to lay the foundation stone for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train — a first for India. Further, Abe envisions a security diamond comprising Japan, Australia, the US and India to secure the seas of the Asia-Pacific region. These are interesting facts when viewed in isolation. Put together, they paint the picture of a leader who wants to work with India.\nThe good news for India is that this will continue. And with the mandate Abe has won, his resolve to push his plans through is likely to increase, even if it doesn't happen immediately.\n", "domain": "firstpost.com", "entry_id": "e0efa0f4_in", "news_id": "47544409a70e4a824b8f3aac404fd652_in", "title": "Shinzo Abe wins Japan snap polls: LDP's major victory augurs well for region and India", "ts": 1508765855, "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/world/watch-shinzo-abe-wins-japan-snap-polls-ldps-thumping-victory-will-strengthen-pms-resolve-in-region-4166471.html"}

1af6949_in	{"content": "The situation was similar, if not worse, in the neighbouring regions of Delhi such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad \nNew Delhi: A quiet and promising evening gave way to thick haze and noise as Delhi celebrated Diwali tonight, dashing the hopes of cracker-free festivities, following a Supreme Court ban on the sale of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR).\nThe online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the city glowed red, indicating a 'very poor' air quality as the volume of ultra fine particulates PM2.5 and PM10, which enter the respiratory system and manage to reach the bloodstream, sharply rose from around 7 pm.\nReal time pollution data appeared alarming. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) RK Puram monitoring station recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 878 and 1,179 micrograms per cubic metre at around 11 pm.\nThe pollutants had violated the corresponding 24-hour safe limits of 60 and 100 respectively by up to 10 times.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers, residents across the national capital felt the beginning was promising with neighbourhoods reporting much lesser noise and smoke till about 6 pm, compared to the previous years.\nBut as the festivities picked up, the faint echo of crackers started growing louder.\nAccording to the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 154 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre respectively at around 11 pm.\nIt has forecast that the pollution levels will peak between 11 pm and 3 am.\nThe situation was similar, if not worse, in the neighbouring regions of Delhi such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad, where crackers were burst as usual, raising question marks on the efficacy of the administration in enforcing the apex court's ban.\nHowever, the SAFAR has also predicted a relatively cleaner post-Diwali air due to favourable meteorological conditions, which are helping prevent the smoke-filled air from the agricultural belt of \nHaryana and Punjab from entering the national capital.\nA 'very poor' air quality index (AQI) essentially means that people may suffer from respiratory illnesses on a prolonged exposure to such air. If the air quality dips further, the AQI will turn 'severe', which may trouble even those with sound health conditions and seriously affect those with ailments.\nThe Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) is empowered to enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR.\nMeasures under the GRAP's 'very poor' and 'severe' categories, which include a ban on diesel generator sets, came into effect on October 17 and they will remain in force till March 15.\n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "1af6949_in", "news_id": "1c86c4e4b21c5d468c44b1021a230ee3_in", "title": "On Diwali, cracker ban goes up in smoke, but air quality better", "ts": 1508471268, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/india/cracker-ban-goes-up-in-smoke-on-diwali-night-in-delhi-2051019.html?src=fb"}

That seems to be the mantra as carriers are substantially lowering the average spot airfare of tickets on Diwali eve.\n  Flight tickets from Mumbai continues to buck the trend owing to capacity constraints which limit the number of flights that can be operated from the airport. (Reuters) \nPay less for flights on Diwali eve. That seems to be the mantra as carriers are substantially lowering the average spot airfare of tickets on Diwali eve, usually the highest in a calendar year, that are booked a week before departure. Thanks to increased capacity by airlines on some of the routes and a slowdown in certain sectors of the economy, a lower priceline around the festival of lights seems the new normal.\nHowever, flight tickets from Mumbai, the most congested airport in the country, continues to buck the trend owing to capacity constraints which limit the number of flights that can be operated from the airport.\nAccording to data from travel portal Yatra, airfares in the Delhi-Mumbai route shrank by 38% to `3,412 compared to the day before Diwali last year. Ditto on the Hyderabad-Delhi route, which fell by 32% to Rs 4,481, while on the Delhi-Kolkata route, the decrease was comparatively lower, 6% to `5,759. Spot fares on another popular route, Delhi-Bengaluru, have managed to remain flat at Rs 5,611.\nCapacity constraints in Mumbai have led to a substantial rise in ticket prices to most of the metro cities since airlines can now operate a limited number of flights. Average ticket prices on the day before Diwali increased by a whopping 76% to Rs 15,802 compared to the same day last year. On the Mumbai-Bengaluru route, too, spot airfares have increased by 104% to Rs 8,045 compared with just Rs 3,946.\nAccording to a senior Air India executive, prices on some of the routes have come down this year, especially the ones in which capacity has been added. This is, of course, with the exception of Mumbai.\nIndiGo, the country’s largest carrier by market share, also announced a three-day discount — from October 11 to October 13 — on certain sectors, including the metro routes.\nTravel will have to be commenced within 15 days of booking the ticket. The discounts also include destinations like Jaipur, Amritsar and Srinagar, which are popular tourist destinations. Vistara — a full-service carrier — also announced similar discounts on flight tickets for travel around the Diwali period.\nAccording to a survey conducted by Yatra, last-minute fares are on the lower side on popular routes compared to previous years due to increased capacity, but higher on others where there has been no significant increase in capacity. This also encourages the ongoing trend of advance booking since airlines have announced a series of discounts.\n“The last-minute fares for Diwali are on the lower side when compared to the previous year due to increased capacity on popular routes. However, on routes where there has been no significant increase in capacity, we have seen high fares. Additionally, as per our recent festive survey, we observed that 73% of travellers were looking for a quick getaway during Diwali. A similar trend is also reflected in our bookings during the season so far across various lines of businesses,” said Sharad Dhall, COO, Yatra.com.\n", "domain": "financialexpress.com", "entry_id": "b4858088_in", "news_id": "c909f1b1fe11930d1a71d8e013586e1a_in", "title": "Diwali airfare sale 2017: From SpiceJet, Air India to Indigo, airlines offer big discounts", "ts": 1507953523, "url": "http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/diwali-airfare-sale-2017-from-spicejet-air-india-to-indigo-airlines-offer-big-discounts/893936/"}
ed79cdf8_in	{"content": "When tensions rose between the two sides, the Chinese had built up their presence to a size that exceeded a division opposite Sikkim. The Indian Army had also matched the build-up but did not feel the need to get troops close to the border due to the shorter distance\nImages captured by an Indian UAV of Chinese and Bhutanese army personnel on May 24.\nContrary to public perception that the border standoff between India and China at Doklam involved a small number of troops, the Chinese had posted more than 12,000 soldiers, 150 tanks and artillery guns opposite Sikkim at Phari Dzong in Chumbi Valley during the 73-day standoff, a new book has revealed.\nThe book, Securing India The Modi Way: Pathankot, Surgical Strikes and More (Bloomsbury), written by Nitin A Gokhale, also contains Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images of the site, which show that the standoff had actually started in the third week of May — it was made public by the Chinese on June 26.\nApart from a blow-by-blow account of the standoff, the book includes extensive quotes from National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, military chiefs and other senior Indian officials on Modi government’s approach to security issues. A chapter of the book, which will be released by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu in Delhi on Friday, was exclusively accessed by The Indian Express.\nThe book reveals that when tensions rose between the two sides, the Chinese had built up their presence to a size that exceeded a division opposite Sikkim. The Indian Army had also matched the build-up but did not feel the need to get troops close to the border due to the shorter distance, it says.\nAt the faceoff site, the book says, the Chinese used loud-hailers, or portable loudspeakers, to issue threats that referred to a repeat of the 1962 war. The Chinese also started construction of temporary defences along the Sikkim border in the form of stone-and-mud emplacements and undertook blasting to improve road infrastructure in their territory.\nThe UAV images in the book show the cheek-by-jowl stationing of soldiers and visible signs of the Chinese presence at Dolam plateau in third week of May. On May 21, the local Chinese commander informed his Indian counterpart that they were going to undertake “infrastructure activities in the area”, says the book. The Indian officer, aware of earlier instances of the Chinese repairing and starting annual maintenance of the existing road, noted the input but did not feel alarmed, it says.\nSikkim Impasse Explained: What Is The India-China-Bhutan Border Standoff?\nThe Chinese returned on May 24 in what was their first patrol of this summer to the area, says the book. They came up to the parking area, which marks the end of the existing road from Yatung to Doklam Plateau via Sinchela, and interacted with personnel of the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) as Indian Army troops watched from their post at Doka La, 200 metres away.\nAn Indian Army UAV captured the encounter between the two sides, which ended quickly with the Chinese and Bhutanese soldiers returning to their posts. The book says that the next encounter between the two sides took place on June 5, when another Chinese patrol came to the parking area. This time, the Chinese soldiers jostled with Bhutanese soldiers and forcibly “escorted” them to the RBA posts after threatening them, it says.\nThe Indians later learnt from their Bhutanese counterparts that the Chinese had warned the RBA to not interfere with the road construction they were about to undertake, the book says. The Indian officer on the ground duly reported the matter up the chain. And, according to the book, the Army Headquarters in Delhi decided to deal with the situation as it evolved but increased the vigil on ground. Then, at 7.30 am on June 16, a PLA light vehicle and nine heavy vehicles, including road construction equipment, reached the parking area.\nAn interaction between Indian and Chinese personnel took place at Contact Point from 7.50 to 10.10 am, says the book. Between 12.51 and 1.31 pm, a patrol of eight Bhutanese soldiers, which had come from Chela Post on the Jampheri Ridge, interacted with the Chinese in the parking area. The Chinese accompanied the Bhutanese patrol along the alignment of an under-construction track up to Jampheri Ridge, which was meant to be an extension of the existing road from Yatung to Dolam Plateau. The Chinese had taken four years to construct this road starting 1999.\nAt 1.50 pm, the book says, Indian troops delivered a message through a loud-hailer from Doka La to stop construction but the Chinese did not pay heed. According to the book, a temporary construction camp was also established by the Chinese in the parking area. The next morning, JCBs commenced construction work following which the Indian troops interacted twice with the Chinese, repeatedly asking them to stop but in vain.\nThe Chinese commenced work again on the morning of June 18, south of the parking area, says the book. The Indian officers on location carried out four interactions with the Chinese, and asked them to stop the construction activity. The matter was reported up the military hierarchy, the book reveals, and orders were issued from Delhi to stop the Chinese. At 7.52 am, the book says, a “human chain’ was formed by Indian troops to effectively block the Chinese. In response, by noon, another human chain was formed by 150 PLA troops opposite the Indian formation — this was effectively overwhelmed by more Indian troops.\nTwo days later, the highest Military Commander-Level flag meeting between two Major Generals was held at Nathu La with both sides stating their stance. The book says cordial interactions subsequently took place at Doka La on a daily basis between the Commanding Officers of both sides. A thaw started taking place from August 14 as diplomatic activity picked up pace, eventually leading to a disengagement on August 28. On September 7, as first reported by The Indian Express, both sides moved away by 150 metres from the faceoff site as the first major step in the disengagement.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "ed79cdf8_in", "news_id": "be2c06d694640c114f8e1e78c19654fa_in", "title": "Doklam faceoff: China deployed more, standoff began earlier", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/doklam-issue-india-china-deployed-more-standoff-began-earlier-4859674/"}

India showed sublime skills in their clinical demolition of the Malaysian side and will look to carry on the winning form.\nThough India are on top of the table with four points from one draw and one win, Malaysia are close second with three points from their win against Pakistan, while Korea have two points from two draws and Pakistan are at No.4 with one point. Yet, the pool is open for any of these teams to make the final. \n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "411d592_in", "news_id": "c7bb1ecdd399e31178abe9e28c9d2474_in", "title": "India hammer Pakistan 4-0, enter Hockey Asia Cup 2017 final", "ts": 1508601457, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/other-sports/live-score-and-updates-of-india-vs-pakistan-asia-cup-super-4s-hockey-2051271.html?utm_source=izooto&utm_medium=push_notification&utm_campaign=browser_push&utm_content=&utm_term="}

Reacting to the Mersal row, Gandhi said cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language. His comments come a day after the Tamil Nadu BJP unit objected to Tamil superstar Vijay’s Diwali release, Mersal, for “criticising” the Centre’s flagship schemes, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Digital India.\n“Mr. Modi, Cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language.

But the criticism should be based on facts.”\n“I asked many of my friends in Singapore about Vijay’s claims in the movie. They all said that there is a medical premium imposed on people and that medical treatment is not free. Also, getting medical facilities is very difficult for Singapore’s people. So, it is a lie that they are trying to spread through the movie,” Raja added.\nEarlier today, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had mocked the party as well for targeting Vijay’s film, saying there will soon be a law to ensure only documentaries “praising” the government’s policies can be released. “BJP demands deletion of dialogues in ‘Mersal’. Imagine the consequences if ‘Parasakthi’ was released today,” the former finance minister had tweeted. “Notice to film makers: Law is coming, you can only make documentaries praising government’s policies.”\nIn the film, popular comic actor Vadivelu in one scene shows a thief in Singapore his wallet and thanks “Digital India” for it being empty. In another scene, Vijay says that Singapore offers its citizens free healthcare while the GST rate is 7 per cent, but in India, GST is 28 per cent but residents do not receive the same facility.\nVideo of the day\nExpresso EP1: Is Arjun Rampal A Victim Of His Circumstances?\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "2be7639e_in", "news_id": "7cac4d7beddecb9c5539e7610c2e2a91_in", "title": "Mersal row: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi, says do not ‘demon-etise’ Tamil pride", "ts": 1508578913, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/tamil-nadu-mersal-narendra-modi-rahul-gandhi-actor-vijay-gst/?utm_source=izooto&utm_medium=push_notification&utm_campaign=browser_push&utm_content=&utm_term="}

The 508 km high-speed rail link to Mumbai is seen as a centrepiece piece of PM Modi's efforts to demonstrate India's capability to build high-tech projects. The project, quite like the Delhi Metro, is also symbolic of New Delhi and Tokyo's close ties to combat China's growing regional influence. \nHere is your 10-point cheat-sheet to this story:\nThe foundation stone-laying ceremony at the Sabarmati railway station is PM Abe first official engagement since he landed to a grand reception last afternoon. The two leaders have been together in informal settings since then and will hold summit meetings after this function.\nThe project will cost Rs. 1.10 lakh crore. Japan will fund 81 per cent of the entire project, nearly Rs. 88,000 crores, in soft loans at an interest rate of 0.1%. The loan will have to be repaid over 50 years.\nA joint venture between the Indian Railways and the Japanese firm Shinkansen Technology, the Japanese side estimates the first bullet train will roll out only by 2023.\nNew Railways Minister Piyush Goyal says PM Modi wants the train to start a year ahead of schedule - on 15 August 2022 - when India completes 75 years of independence.\nThe new train will race between PM Modi's home state Gujarat and Mumbai, the financial capital carrying 750 passengers. It can make 70 Ahmedabad-Mumbai trips in a day.\nIt is expected to run on an average speed of 250 km per hour, with a top speed of around 320 km per hour - more than double the top speed of the fastest train in India.\nThe travel time will be reduced from eight hours to a little over three hours if it stops at all the 12 stations and around two hours if it stops at only four.\nOf the 508-km stretch, 92 per cent of the route will be elevated, six per cent through a tunnel and the rest on the ground. The high speed train will pass through the country's longest tunnel of 21 km, of which seven km will be under sea.\nBut the Maharashtra government is still iffy on where the bullet train will end in Mumbai. The state government this week agreed to spare 9,000 sq metres plot for the station at Bandra-Kurla Complex on the condition that the railways assess suitability of an alternative site.\nA greater stretch of this link, 351 km, will run through Gujarat and 156 km through Maharashtra.\n", "domain": "m.ndtv.com", "entry_id": "f16db0fa_in", "news_id": "484b389e320ab84fd2bd9122b0f35e0e_in", "title": "Bullet Train Project Begins Today, Cost 1.1 Lakh Crores: 10-Point Guide", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/bullet-train-project-begins-today-cost-1-1-lakh-crores-your-10-point-guide-1750053?pfrom=home-lateststories"}

37fe5f75_in	{"content": "At least two state finance ministers said a number of items like steel products such as rods used for construction are in the top bracket and do not belong there. (Representative image)\n NEW DELHI: The GST Council may reduce the number of products in the highest slab, following a series of complaints by state finance ministers, who have argued that several common-use products face a 28% levy, causing hardship to people. \n At least two state finance ministers told TOI that a number of items like bath fittings, cement, steel products such as rods used for construction are in the top bracket and do not belong there. \"The idea was to classify the goods and services into merit and non-merit goods with the non-metrit goods in the top bracket. But we have gone beyond that,\" said a state finance minister, who has usually sided with the Centre on most issues. \n The minister said the \"block\" was too big and needed to be reduced. On Saturday, CBEC officials had also said that there were far too many items in the top slab. \n The second state FM said the issue is expected to be discussed at the next meeting of the Council scheduled in Guwahati, given the concerns expressed by several states. \n \"In the medium-term the aim is to move to fewer slabs,\" the minister said. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had last week reiterated the plan to move to fewer slabs in the future. \n Some of the state government officials also believe that the 28% levy was also resulting in sellers evading taxes as it is quite common for shopkeepers to advise buyers to pay in cash, where no invoice is issued. \n The talk of reducing the number of products in the top bracket follows finalisation of a concept paper at last Friday's GST Council meeting. \n It was decided that a formula for review, including the need for reduction in slabs, the tax credits available and revenue impact will have to be discussed by the Council in detail before a decision is taken, said a source. \n Separately, the government has also announced the establishment of a panel of state FMs, which will review the tax structure for different categories of restaurants for a possible reduction or rationalisation. \n Restaurants currently face a levy of 12% to 28%, depending on whether they are mere eateries or restaurants in five-star hotels. \n In addition, the panel has three other terms of reference, including possible exemption for sales revenue from exempted goods in calculating the overall turnover of an entity, a decision that is fraught with the risk of massive leakage from the government treasury. \n The committee will see if the composition scheme can be extended to outward supply of goods. The scheme allows traders (1%), manufacturers (2%) and eateries (5%) with turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore to pay GST at a flat rate with a lower compliance burden. \n In deciding GST rates, the government had opted for a principle of equivalence, where the combined incidence of VAT and excise, or service tax, was factored in. \n The Centre's focus was on ensuring that there was no rise in the burden on common-use items, especially those which are part of consumer price index, while protecting its revenue. Several items such as stationary were put in the top bracket, decisions that have already been tweaked. \n", "domain": "timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "37fe5f75_in", "news_id": "9935085b06a49279c72a3858d13c64ac_in", "title": "'Common-use products in highest GST category': Govt may reduce items in 28% slab", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/common-use-products-in-highest-gst-category-govt-may-reduce-items-in-28-slab/articleshow/60998760.cms?utm_source=toiiphoneapp&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=show"}

The foundation stone for the first bullet train project, connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad will be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday i.e. September 14, 2017, in Ahmedabad. “The commencement of work on the country’s first High-Speed Rail (Bullet train) project will begin on September 14 in Ahmedabad,” Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, Sanjeev Sinha, former Tata executive working in Tokyo was appointed as the . The bullet train is aimed to connect Ahmedabad and Mumbai at an estimated cost of Rs 1,10,000 crore.On the Ahmedabad-Mumbai route, total 12 stations have been proposed that include Mumbai, Thane, Virar, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad, and Sabarmati.\nInteresting facts about Ahmedabad-Mumbai Bullet Train Project:\nThe long-awaited Bullet Train project will start from Ahmedabad and will cover 508 kilometers via Sabarmati, Surat, and Vadodara to reach Mumbai. The 508 kms include Maharashtra(156 KMs), Gujarat(351 KMs) and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli (2 KMs).\nThe high-speed train will also pass through the country’s biggest tunnel of 21 km, of which seven km will be under the sea (Thane Creek)\nThe 508-km Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail Project will entail an estimated cost of Rs 1,10,000 crore.\nOut of the Rs 1,10,000 crore, Japan is giving a loan of Rs 88,000 crore and the interest on this loan is minimal, i.e. 0.1 per cent. This loan is to be repaid to Japan in 50 years. Loan repayment period of 50 years with 15 years grace.”\nThe operating speed of the bullet train will be 320 kilometers per hour and maximum speed will be 350 kilometers per hour. If the bullet train will stop at all 12 stations, then it will cover the distance in two hours and fifty-eight minutes.\nThe bullet train will cover the distance of 508 km in two hours and seven minutes if it stops at four stations namely Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, and Mumbai. In a day, the high-speed train will make 70 Ahmedabad-Mumbai sorties.\nA total of 24 high-speed trains will be imported from Japan and the rest of the rakes will be manufactured in India\nAbout 825 hectares of land would be acquired for the high-speed rail\nOf the 508-km stretch, 92 per cent of the route will be elevated; six per cent in the tunnel and the rest two per cent will be on the ground.\nThe 508 km stretch will have 468 km of elevated track, 27 km inside the tunnel and the remaining 13 km on the ground.\nThe new Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project is being developed by a consortium of 6 Japanese companies under the aegis of Japan Railways Group. The funding for this project comes as the part of a low-interest loan extended to India by Japan. An interest rate of 0.1% over a 50-year term and repayment moratorium for the first 15 years, the funding from Japan for the High-Speed Rail, called Shinkansen in Japan, is almost like a grant based on standard financial valuation calculations.\nWith the Indian Railways adopting most modern technologies, the bullet train was an endeavor to bring economic growth and prosperity in the country, he said. Piyush Goyal said that the high-speed rail was envisioned by PM Modi to take Indian Railways towards most modern technologies like developed countries.

He further added that a dedicated High-Speed Rail Training Institute is being developed at Vadodara which will be functional by the end of 2020. The facilities at this institute will be utilized to train about 4,000 staff in next three years, who will then be utilized for operation and maintenance ensuring that this work is through skilled people in India rather than foreign dependent.

(TOI Photo)\n KOCHI: In what could be a shocking blow to former Indian pacer S Sreesanth, a division bench of the Kerala high court on Tuesday upheld the appeal made by the BCCI against the earlier single bench verdict that lifted the life ban on the bowler in August this year. \n The division bench of Chief Justice Navniti Prasad Singh ruled that the court cannot conduct a judicial review on the life ban imposed by the BCCI and hence upheld the appeal. \n The court heard the appeal petition for the past two days and delivered its verdict, which has now for the time being ended his hopes of not just playing for Kerala Ranji side in its upcoming matches but also to take part in practise sessions at any place that comes under the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or any state cricket association. \n Speaking to the media, Kerala Cricket Association secretary Jayesh George said the KCA was supporting Sreesanth ever since the ban was lifted. \n \"We had made arrangements for him to undergo a full fitness test so as to make him match fit. Now with this verdict, we will now have to respect it,\" said George. \n Now the only option before Sreesanth is to approach the apex court and, according to sources close to the bowler, he is likely to go in appeal against this verdict. \n In 2015, the now 34-year-old pacer along with two other players got exonerated by the Delhi court in the case registered by Delhi Police which invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), but the BCCI Disciplinary Committee headed by the present Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley slapped a life ban on Sreesanth. \n Following this, he approached the Kerala HC, which on August 7 lifted the life ban. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "3bda4807_in", "news_id": "9bec82d3f020a65eae2e313efdbe2e3d_in", "title": "Kerala HC upholds BCCI appeal, Sreesanth life ban to stay", "ts": 1508254128, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/news/kerala-hc-upholds-bcci-appeal-sreesanth-life-ban-to-stay/articleshow/61119502.cms"}

It also underscores the present government’s stated objective of ensuring greater social security,” Iyer said.\nThe gratuity ceiling for government employees was raised to Rs 20 lakh earlier as part of the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations, the government’s statement said.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "51efea31_in", "news_id": "9ba12a7b48323118263ecb4e90b7d29b_in", "title": "Cabinet clears 1% DA hike; good news for 49 lakh staffers, 61 lakh pensioners", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-1-hike-in-da-for-employees-and-pensioners/story-31NX4D7KlbMNr8teqvHG1O.html"}

For last fiscal, it was around 47 per cent.\nWagonR was launched in 1999 and has been among the top five best selling cars since then, according to a senior official from Maruti Suzuki.\nThe best selling model of the company -- Alto crossed the feat of 2 million sales in 2012 and was launched in 2000.

Though, the model has been successful across the country, cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore and Ahmedabad have contributed the most towards its total sales, the official said.\nCommenting on the development, R S Kalsi, Senior Executive Director, Marketing and Sales, Maruti Suzuki said,”Since its inception, WagonR has been ahead of its peers owing to its unique ‘Tall Boy Design,’ which was a first for the compact car segment in India. Its comfort seating, spacious interiors, superior fuel efficiency, practicality and pleasure of driving have made it a popular choice.”\nMaruti Suzuki has systematically upgraded the brand periodically to keep it relevant, he said, adding customers are now days aspirational and expects enhanced quality of design, features and technologies which it has been adequately addressed by the company, he said.\nWagonR has topped the sales chart for over 18 years now and even after such level of competition in the small car space, WagonR continues to be the preferred choice of the practical car buyer, Kalsi added.\nAmong the news features added to the WagonR model, auto gear shift trims account for over 16 per cent of the sales while CNG accounts for over 20 per cent of the sales. It was the first car with a tall boy design and first one to be offered as a dual fuel model in one car -- petrol and LPG.

Rules, regulations and the legal position is quite clear,\" Khanna was quoted as saying by TOI.\nEarlier in the day, the 34-year-old hinted at the possibility of turning up for another country, saying \"BCCI has imposed the ban, not ICC\".\nIn an interview to Asianet News, the 34-year-old hinted that since BCCI has banned him from playing in India, he has the freedom to play cricket for any other country. During the interview, he also claimed that the Indian cricket board is a \"private firm\".\n\"BCCI has imposed the ban, not ICC. If not India, I can play for any other country, because am 34 now and I can only play for maximum six more years. As a person who loves cricket, I want to play cricket. And not only that, BCCI is a private firm; it is only us who say that this is the Indian team, but you know BCCI is a private body after all.\n\"So, if I play for any other country, it probably may be the same. Yes, representing Kerala in Ranji Trophy is different. I had hoped to win Ranji Trophy, Irani for Kerala, but the decision rests upon the BCCI,\" Sreesanth said.\nIn August, a single bench of the court had quashed the BCCI's ban on Sreesanth. It observed that “no material or evidence before the disciplinary committee to conclude that Sreesanth was guilty of a violation of the anti-corruption code formulated by the BCCI”.\nBut, while restoring the ban earlier this week, the division bench said the court cannot conduct a reappraisal of the evidence that BCCI's disciplinary committee relied on. It also said that it's only conducting a judicial review and is not sitting as an appellate authority over BCCI's decision.\nHe was banned for life following allegations of spot-fixing during an Indian Premier League match in 2013.\nThe right-arm fast-medium bowler played 27 Tests, 53 ODIs and 10 T20Is for India, taking 87, 75 and 7 wickets respectively.\nHe last played for India in a Test match against England at The Oval in August 2011.\n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "36822e6e_in", "news_id": "f1e9166cf1310e791db50c430d3964ca_in", "title": "S Sreesanth cannot play for any other country: BCCI", "ts": 1508601457, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/cricket/s-sreesanth-cannot-play-for-any-other-country-bcci-2051164.html"}

Jokes aside, editorial head Kunal Dua and games editor Rishi Alwani join host Pranay Parab to talk about Nokia 8, which offers reliable performance overall. We discuss whether you should buy it over the OnePlus 5 or the iPhone 7. This episode starts with a discussion around the Bothie feature of Nokia 8, which lets you shoot videos using both front and rear cameras at the same time. We talk about how useful that feature is, if at all, and whether we see ourselves using it for journalistic purposes.\nThe talk around Nokia 8 moves to the smartphone's build quality, which is where we have a debate around its design. While the Nokia 8's bezels may make it look old and boring, we discuss whether that's something people should care about or focus instead on how well the phone works. The panelists on this podcast have differing opinions on this subject. Then we move on to topics such as the Nokia 8's fingerprint sensor and whether its lack of waterproofing is a big deal.\nFinally we talk about the competition. There are several competitors for the Nokia 8, such as Xiaomi Mi MIX 2, OnePlus 5, Google Pixel, and of course the iPhone 7. We talk about the positives of each phone and which one people should be buying. Since Nokia 8 comes with a promise of fast Android updates, the choice is not straightforward as it may seem. This is where the headphone jack comes into the discussion and we discuss whether it is a factor in buying decisions at the Rs. 30,000 and above price point.\nThat's all for this week's episode of Orbital, which you can subscribe to via Apple Podcasts or RSS, or just hit the play button below.\n", "domain": "m.gadgets.ndtv.com", "entry_id": "20c6cc9b_in", "news_id": "ff658e384f77609f2190694c63139c42_in", "title": "Nokia 8, OnePlus 5, or iPhone 7: Which One Should You Buy?", "ts": 1508419241, "url": "http://m.gadgets.ndtv.com/podcasts/features/nokia-8-iphone-7-or-oneplus-5-which-one-should-you-buy-1764662?pfrom=home"}

Let’s find out.\nThe 4G VoLTE-enabled Micromax Bharat 1 takes on the Reliance JioPhone.(HT Photo)\nIndian smartphone maker Micromax launched on Tuesday a smart feature phone, Bharat 1. Competing with Reliance Jio’s JioPhone, the Bharat 1 is priced aggressively at Rs 2,200 and, thanks to a tie-up with the state-run telecom operator BSNL, comes with unlimited data and calling through a Rs 97-monthly plan.\nThe philosophy behind the Bharat 1 feature phone is similar to Jio’s – offering affordable mobile data to entry-level consumers, especially in rural and remote areas of the country. While Reliance Jio has increased its coverage over months, BSNL has a big presence in India’s remote areas.\nMicromax’s Bharat 1 matches the Reliance JioPhone in several aspects, providing affordable high-speed mobile data, unlimited voice calling and access to multimedia content. Here’s a look at Bharat 1’s features, specifications and tariff plans and how it compares with the Reliance JioPhone.\nPrice\nThe Bharat 1 will go on sale via retail stores on October 20 for Rs 2,200 whereas the Reliance JioPhone is available with a security deposit of Rs 1,500 (refundable after three years). Reliance Jio is expected to resume pre-booking for the JioPhone after Diwali, once it has delivered the 6 million units it booked in August. Micromax hasn’t revealed how many units of the phone will be available.\nDesign\nThe Reliance JioPhone and Bharat 1 look similar. The two phones come in candy bar form factor — standard design for feature phones. The two also have an alpha numeric keyboard and a four-way navigation trackpad at the center. One major difference is the trackpad on JioPhone can be used to activate voice commands, a feature missing on the Bharat 1. Remaining design elements such as removable back panel, placement of USB port and 3.5mm audio jack and torch are very much the same.\n UI The homescreen on the Bharat 1 prominently displays four key features – contacts, camera, phone and message. On navigating right, you will notice all the sections displayed in a square-ish boxes, similar to what you may have seen on older Lumia phones. The JioPhone has also fairly standard interface with Android-like feel to the UI. The app icons are showcased in circular boxes and have smaller default text than the Bharat 1. \nA preview of the interface on the Bharat 1 4G VoLTE feature phone. (HT Photo)\nWhat’s common is that both the UIs are fairly simple to use and allows users to get started with the features swiftly. While it may not be appealing to smartphone users, the UI seems has been designed keeping first-time or not-so-tech-savvy phone users in mind — certainly not a negative for these two phones.\nSpecifications\nThe Bharat 1 comes with a 2.4-inch QVGA screen. It is powered by a Qualcomm 205 processor coupled with 512MB of RAM. The smart feature phone comes with a 2-megapixel rear camera and a VGA selfie camera. The device has 4GB of built-in storage (expandable via a microSD card).\nIt is powered by a 2,000mAh battery. Connectivity options include dual-SIM, 4G, VoLTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi hotspot.\nThe Bharat 1 comes with a removable back panel. (HT Photo)\n The Reliance JioPhone comes with a 2.4-inch QWVGA screen. It runs on KAI operating system and is powered by a 1.2GHz dual-core processor by Speadtrum. It features 512MB of RAM and Mali-400 clocked at 512MHz. It has 4GB of built-in storage, expandable up to 128GB via a microSD card. \nThe JioPhone sports a 2-megapixel rear camera and a 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. Connectivity options on the phone include single SIM, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and microUSB. It is powered by a 2,000mAh battery.\nDifference\nThe Reliance JioPhone is a single SIM phone whereas the Bharat 1 is a dual-SIM phone. The Micromax phone has a bigger battery as compared to Jio’s and also has Wi-Fi hotspot feature, which is missing on the JioPhone.\nData plans, features and more\nWhile Reliance JioPhone comes bundled with Jio apps like MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioChat, JioMusic, JioXpressNews, the Bharat 1 also has dedicated applications for access to Live TV, music, movies and videos streaming. Both the phones support browsing on mobile data and lack support for apps like WhatsApp and Facebook.\nThe Reliance JioPhone also supports a screen mirroring-like feature via JioPhone TV cable. (HT Photo)\nBSNL is offering a Rs 97 monthly plan under which the operator is offering unlimited voice calling and mobile data usage. Reliance Jio is offering a Rs 153 monthly data plan under which it is offering 500MB daily data and unlimited voice calling. It is worth noting that JioPhone customers need to recharge Rs 4,500 during the three-year timeframe.\nWe are yet to hear from BSNL about its terms and conditions, and fair usage policy for the Bharat 1. Micromax claims the effective cost of ownership for the Bharat 1 after two years is much cheaper than JiPhone’s. According to Micromax, Bharat 1 users with BSNL data plan would have paid Rs 4,528 after two years whereas JioPhone users would pay Rs 5,172 in the same time period.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "be8df811_in", "news_id": "55c16ccd73baa7d57743b0c5ac9b90a5_in", "title": "Reliance JioPhone vs Micromax Bharat 1: Price, specs, tariff plans compared", "ts": 1508305859, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/tech/reliance-jiophone-vs-micromax-bharat-1-price-specs-tariff-plans-compared/story-soo6PPD9sBkgdopkciA5xN.html"}

The government can extend the detention only after the approval from the judicial review board. \n Lahore police had made strict security measures around the Lahore High Court building where Saeed and others were presented before the board. \n The board, after hearing the law officer, issued notices to Advocate General Punjab and foreign and interior secretaries to appear before it on October 19 to tell as to why the government wants extension to Saeed's house arrest. \n On last Saturday, the Punjab home department had withdrawn its request from federal board to seek the extension to detention of Saeed and others under \"anti-terrorism act\". \n Explaining as to why the government withdrew its application seeking extension to detention of Saeed and others, the Punjab government said since it has extended the detention of Saeed and four others for October 24 under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance 1960, it does not require to have their house arrest extended under the anti-terrorism law. \n On January 31, Saeed and four others were detained by the Punjab government for 90 days under preventative detention under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. However, the last two extensions were made on the 'public safety law'. \n The Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD) has already been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States in June 2014.

7d351d86_in	{"content": "Preparations at the restaurant where PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart will have dinner on Wednesday. (Express Photo: Javed Raja)\nExactly three years ago, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had flown down to Kyoto, one of Japan’s historic cities, and welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in what was his first bilateral visit outside India’s immediate neighbourhood within four months of assuming office.\nNow, Modi will be returning the favour and welcoming Abe in poll-bound Gujarat on Wednesday. He is likely to go to the airport to receive him — a departure from protocol he has made only for a handful of leaders, including US President Barack Obama.\nSources said Modi would then take Abe on a “massive roadshow” — from the airport to Sabarmati Ashram, possibly in an “open-top limousine” — with people cheering for them. There are plans of having schoolchildren lined up on the route, along with tableaux of 28 states.\nThe road from the airport to the city has been dotted with hoardings with photos of Abe and Modi, as well as cutouts, declaring “a strong synergy for peace and prosperity”, “welcome to the only home of Asiatic lions”, “New India, bright future”, and of course, “Welcome to India, welcome to Gujarat” — in Japanese Hiragana script.\nAfter touring Sabarmati Ashram, the two leaders will meet again and visit a 16th-century mosque — Sidi Sayyaid ki Jaali. Then they will engage in “dinner diplomacy” at one of Ahmedabad’s top-rated restaurants serving authentic local cuisine — similar to what Abe had done for Modi at Kyoto’s state guest house in 2014.\nAfter dinner, the two leaders are planning to go for a walk on a more than 100-year-old bridge, the Ellis bridge on the Sabarmati, which has been decorated with colourful fairy lights. “The roadshow, airport reception, dinner at a roof-top restaurant, and post-dinner walk — they will all send out pictures of warmth between the two leaders. Optics apart, it will give the two leaders ample time to engage with each other for almost eight hours on the first day of the visit,” a top source involved in the arrangements told The Indian Express.\nIn a massive operation to broadcast the images, about 100 cameras — 40 for the roadshow alone — along with more than 300 personnel have been deputed by Doordarshan to capture every moment between the two leaders over two days. Both sides have carefully chosen “photo opportunities” that are different from those in 2014 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Ahmedabad. “We wanted different locations so that there are no similarities, since the relationships with both countries are at completely different levels,” the source said.\nJust weeks ago, India and China resolved a 10-week-long border standoff at Doklam. Japan was the only major country to publicly articulate its unequivocal support to India during the border crisis.\nIndia and Japan are likely to beef up strategic partnership in the neighbourhood in terms of joint development of projects, sources told The Indian Express. This comes with an eye on China’s attempt to increase its strategic footprint in the region, which has both Tokyo and Delhi worried. Abe’s visit is likely to witness a more pronounced articulation of countering the Chinese sphere of influence.\nDarshana M Baruah, research analyst at Carnegie India who has worked on the subject, said, “Neither India nor Japan are shy of the strategic connotation in their expanding partnership which signifies great comfort and trust in the relationship. China’s expansion… has caused much concern and discomfort in Delhi… Japan on the other hand has a policy on ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’ with India at its centre.” The India-Japan partnership is getting “stronger and bolder” and at the crux of this relationship is the drive to boost connectivity, she added.\nOn Thursday, the two leaders will have bilateral talks at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar. Before that they will address a public meeting after the ground-breaking ceremony for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "7d351d86_in", "news_id": "cc7b6b8036f6d1329cc9c770248d5a6e_in", "title": "Shinzo Abe visit: Airport reception, roadshow, and dinner at roof-top restaurant", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/roads-decked-up-100-cameras-in-place-for-shinzo-abe-visit-today-4840914/"}

Samo rice can also be eaten with pudhina chutney as it detoxifies the body very well.\nHere are seven health tips to help you detox and lose weight during the Navratris. (Source: File Photo)\nDo you cheat on every diet you talk yourself into? If so, Navratri can be the ideal opportunity for you to lose weight and detox. Navratri fasting is believed to bring divine blessing and no way can anyone plan to cheat on that. Here are some things you can eat to lose weight during Navratri which dietician Apoorva Saini of Santoshiarogyam Diet E Clinic swears by.\n1) Protein and fibre are major requirements: They greatly help in weight loss. Pomegranate has lots of fiber, which can really help you if you chew the pomegranate seeds. You can add curd to the seeds if you want. Also, if your fiber intake is more, it can lead to dehydration, so make sure you drink 2-3 litres of water to make up for it.\n2) Limit the consumption of fried food: Fried and oil-soaked foods are a favourite during this time. If you want to detox, limiting the intake of fried puris, pakodas and potato chips is very important. Especially for high-cholesterol patients, fat intake should be less. If you have to eat the kuttu pakodis, you can stuff them with paneer and veggies and fry them in olive oil.\n3) Infused water will help you detox: You can have mint water, cucumber water or fruit-infused water instead of your plain water. To make infused water, soak 100g of fruit in 300ml water overnight. Shakes also help a great deal in detoxifying. But Saini advises going with curd-based shakes, instead of milk-based. “Mix some strawberries with curd and blend them in the mixer. You can add sugar if needed,” she says. This shake can be taken mid-morning.\n4) Mix vegetables with Sabudana khichdi: Most people prefer to eat Sabudana khichdi (Buckwheat khichdi) and kuttu at this time. To up the ante of your detox routine, you can have Sabudana khichdi with veggies, kuttu ke ate ki kadhi, dosa made of kuttu with some curd. Samo rice can also be eaten with pudina (mint) chutney as it helps detoxify the body.\n5) Dry fruits are most beneficial at this time: Almonds, walnuts, dates, anjeer (figs) give a lot of energy. Three figs in the morning will keep you charged through the day; 4-5 dates with 1-2 almonds a day are enough to make up for your iron deficiency that you may get while fasting. Cashews should be avoided if you have high cholesterol. Kishmish (raisin) intake should be accompanied by lots of water as kishmish promotes urination, which could cause dehydration.\n6) Green leafy vegetables makeup for all nutrient deficiencies: Green leafy vegetables in the form of soups can also be taken. Beetroot soup makes up for iron and calcium deficiency due to fasting and is a great detox. Salads such as cucumber, beetroot, carrot, radish, cabbage, asparagus with lemon and mustard seeds are great for weight loss.\n7) Jasmine tea is great for detoxification: Jasmine tea helps to prevent water retention and treats any water retention you might have. Thus, it should be preferred over green or black tea during this time — Try to drink milk before sleeping as it is a great source of protein.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "f0d9f429_in", "news_id": "8974a0cbbab30caa8ee247fe4cdf531c_in", "title": "Navratri 2017: Keeping a fast? 7 ways to detoxify and lose weight this festive season", "ts": 1505884520, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/navratri-2017-use-the-fast-to-detoxify-and-lose-weight-this-festive-season-4851046/"}

GST\nNew Delhi, Oct 16:  The Modi government is considering to scrap the difference in GST taxes between air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned restaurants. The GST panel may make taxes levied on both the types of restaurants to be 12 per cent.\nA report in The Mint said that a five-member panel, formed by the GST council, may retain tax on five-star restaurants to be 18 per cent. Currently, all AC restaurants are taxed 18 per cent, while all non-AC restaurants are charged 12 per cent GST.\nThe report said the final decision on this will be taken at a GST council meeting on November 9. The meeting will be chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. A person privy to the development said there was convergence on views that the rates on AC restaurants should be lowered.\nThe panel will also decide whether AC restaurants should be given the benefit of tax rebates as they do not pass on the rebate to consumers.\nThe Modi government has reviewed GST in view of the slump in economic growth. In the 22nd GST council meet, it was announced that many items would be brought down from 28 per cent slab to 18 per cent slab.

And in Tamil Nadu it’s Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan who are deified, worshipped and bathed in full cream Aavin milk. Now that they’ve ruled the silver screen for over four decades, they both wish to jump out of the screen, and on to the political stage.\nBut who will Tamil Nadu vote for? Rajini and Kamal are as different as day and night! What will the people do? Read on!!!\n(Disclaimer: This article consists of an overdose of exclamations, question marks, and hyperbole. Copy editors, keep off, or I will make you watch Abhay and Lingaa back to back.)\nThe stark (no MARVEL pun intended) differences between the two are quite....stark!!

He’s as direct and down-to-earth as a movie star that a fan can hope for. Except of course, when the ‘P’ word is mentioned. Then he goes all mysterious, quotes ‘God’ and leaves.\nKamal Haasan says he is direct, and that he speaks his mind. But who knows? Who knows what those tweets contain? Those who speak English wonder if it’s cerebral wordplay or spelling mistakes. Those who speak Tamil wonder if it’s a lost dialect, or maybe a Tamil transcript of Igbo or Yoruba.\nYears later, when my children ask me and my other TN friends if Rajini and Kamal wanted to join politics, we will have only one clear answer:\nIt’s always a yes, followed by thunderous applause...and then a pregnant pause that makes us all go ‘damnit! not again!’ inside our minds.

The dream of an utopian TN, where ALL fans hold hands. The stuff of legend! Cue inspirational music! Cue item song! Photo: Vibhushita Singh / The Quint\nThe Twist in the Tale!! Are You Ready?!\nDespite their differences of opinion, beliefs, modes of communication / campaigning and hairstyles, they have always been good friends. And that’s because they share the same roots. They are apples of the same tree, pineapples of the same bush, grapes of the same vine...etc.\nKamal Haasan and Rajinikanth are brothers.

But it has to be sealed properly and should be handled in a delicate manner. The need for emergency supplies can be met through this channel. It may become a popular product in rural areas where for miles there are no fuel pumps,\" Deepak Mahurkar, leader, oil and gas at PricewaterhouseCoopers India told IANS. \nFormer ONGC Chairman and Managing Director R.S.Sharma also said it's a workable idea, but emphasised that safety standards should be maintained. \"It is a technically feasible project. It can become highly commercially scaleable model.

They may charge a service fee as fuel will be delivered at doorsteps. On the other hand, if big players com in they might even cut price, trying to gain more market share. \nThere are around 60,000 fuel retail outlets in India. The size of the entire petroleum industry is aorund Rs 6.5 lakh crore. On average, 40 million consumers come to retail outlets across the country on a daily basis. If petrol is offered online, then it will surely ease pressure on these retail outlets. \n\"Technically it is possible. But it has to have a proper dispensing norm. It needs to stick to the norms set by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) to meet safety.

Congress said his growing social media presence was a result of his tweets resonating with the people of the country. \n The party's social media insider said that the increased engagement has been made possible by methods like the party facilitating \"verification\" of its leaders from Twitter. \n However, after analysing one of his most popular tweets, ANI claimed Rahul's resurgence is mostly inorganic and attributable to bots. \nModi ji quick; looks like President Trump needs another hug https://t.co/B4001yw5rg\n — Office of RG (@OfficeOfRG) 1508056002000 \n The Twitter handles of these alleged bots have a follower list comprising fewer than ten other users, their timelines displayed only retweets of seemingly random topics from around the world, and they lack any original tweets, ANI said. \n Responding to these conflicting reports, Congress chief of Social Media and Digital communications Divya Spandana told ANI, \"On Twitter one tweets and what happens after that is not in our control. You will have to speak to Twitter to get clarity.\" \n Bots are a thriving part of Twitter's user base and study shows an estimated 9 to 15 percent of active accounts are bots.

This shows how much faith Dortmund have in their young superstar.\n Before his multi-million move, Sancho impressed at the Euro Under-17 Championships, where he was named the Golden Player of the tournament. Sancho netted five and also set-up five to help England reach the final of the tournament. Expect the lanky lad from south London to shine in India as well.\n Hot-shot USA striker Josh Sargent is one of the most prolific players who have touched down in the country for this tournament. This will be Sargent’s second World Cup of the year for his country, as he has already represented USA at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Korea.\n The USA number nine scored two goals on his debut against Ecuador and by doing so, he came the youngest American player to net a goal in the tournament’s history.\n Sargent also played a more than crucial role in helping his team qualify for the tournament in India, as he scored five goals in the qualifying round as well.\n Sargent has drawn attention of some of Europe’s top clubs and a move to the football- frenzy continent seems to be on the cards sooner than later.\n Abel Ruiz is a product of the much-famed La Masia (Barcelona Academy) and currently plays for the Barcelona B team — this just says it all doesn’t it!\n Ruiz has been playing at the under 17 level since 2015 and has netted 19 times for his country till yet. Moreover,he also scored his maiden goal for Barcelona B against Granada recently in his first start for the team.\n Barcelona too have high hopes from their young prodigy, who recently led Spain to Uefa Euro Under 17 Championships, where he netted four times.\n Ruiz may only be 17 but if reports are to be believed, he has already attracted a lot of interest from Premier League and other Spanish clubs and Barca will have fight hard for someone, who seems like a future captain in the making.\n Jann-Fiete Arp created Bundesliga history recently when he became the first player to be born in the 21st century and play in the top tier of the German football league.\n Following his eye-catching show at the Euro Under 17 Championships, his parent club Hamburg made sure that their precious young talent is there at the club for the foreseeable future and recently extended his contract till 2019.\n Fiete Arp scored two hat-tricks in four matches during the tournament in Croatia - the first one came against Bosnia and Herzegovina in just 13 mins while the second came against Republic of Ireland.\n In an interview to Uefa.com, Fiete Arp revealed that he idolizes Harry Kane in this Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi mad era. And early signs suggests that - at least in the goal-scoring department - Fiete Arp is walking down the same road as the Spurs superstar.\n If scouts from Manchester United, Juventus and Chelsea are seen keeping tabs on a young footballer more often than not, then obviously that player is doing some really remarkable. One such prodigious talent is Amine Gouiri, who turns out for the France Under 17 team and also Lyon.\n By scoring 8 goals at the Euro U 17 Championships, Gouiri equalled the all-time tournament record in Croatia. Gouri also played a huge role in helping France book the tickets for India as he scored the lone goal against Hungary in Under 17 World Cup play-offs. \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "6605fd_in", "news_id": "6422c04c52f5a37d78d9414e0223e652_in", "title": "FIFA U-17 World Cup: Five Stars Who Can Take Event by Storm", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/sports/fifa-u-17-world-cup-five-stars-who-can-take-event-by-storm-1536283.html"}

Kalburgi was killed at his home in the north Karnataka town of Dharwad at around 8.40 am on August 30, 2015 by an unidentified gunman who rang his doorbell.\nPolice recovered the three bullets that pierced Lankesh’s heart and lungs before exiting her body and a bullet that missed her along with the four empty cartridges. While the four cartridges were found at the murder site shortly after the killing, the fatal bullets were found by a search of the crime scene with metal detectors.\nInvestigators decided to compare the “ballistic signature” on the bullets and cartridges in the Lankesh case with that of bullets and cartridges in the Kalburgi case. The analysis has reported a match suggesting that one common gun was used in the two killings, sources said. This also suggests that one common outfit or group is behind the two killings, an official said.\nGuns are believed to leave unique markings on cartridges and bullets — when the cartridge is struck by the firing pin and the bullet travels through the barrel — on the lines of fingerprints although there are sceptics who caution against using this matching test for crude countrymade weapons.\nThe forensic finding from the comparison of the ballistic evidence from the Lankesh and Kalburgi cases when juxtaposed with the forensic analysis of the shooting down of Maharashtra rationalist Govind Pansare, 81, on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur, suggests that the same gun has been used in three different killings over the last 30 months.\nFollowing the murder of Kalburgi and Pansare in 2015, the Karnataka CID had attempted to analyse the evidence in the two cases by comparing striations on the bullets and cartridges used in the two murders and had found a match.\nGovind Pansare and his wife Uma Pansare were shot with five bullets from two 7.65-mm countrymade guns. Uma Pansare survived the shooting. The forensic analysis in the Pansare and Kalburgi case revealed that one of the two guns used in the Pansare case in Maharashtra was the same gun used to shoot down Kalburgi in Karnataka.\nA further comparison of the ballistic evidence found in the Pansare case with that of evidence in the shooting of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, 69, on August 20, 2013 in Pune revealed that the second gun used to shoot Pansare was the same gun that was used to kill Dabholkar.\nIn the 2013 killing of Dabholkar, the motorcycle borne assailant fired four bullets.\nThough the investigation of the Kalburgi killing in Karnataka by the CID has not resulted in any headway in finding the killers, the CID has been co-ordinating with the CBI which is probing the Dabholkar murder and a Maharashtra SIT probing the Pansare murder.\nThe investigations in the Dabholkar and Pansare cases by the CBI and the Maharashtra SIT suggested the involvement of the radical right-wing outfit, Sanatan Sanstha, in the two killings.\nOn the basis of directions issued by the Bombay High Court on January 7, 2016, the Karnataka police shared information from its forensic findings in the Kalburgi case with the CBI and the Maharashtra SIT.\nA co-ordination meeting was held by officers of the CBI, the SIT, Maharashtra and the CID, Karnataka on February 17, 2016, to discuss the investigation of the three seemingly linked murder cases. The CBI suggested verification of the ballistic findings of the Karnataka forensic lab through the Directorate of Forensic Services, at Scotland Yard, London.\nSources said Scotland Yard confirmed the forensic findings in the Dabholkar, Pansare and Kalburgi cases but did not issue a report for lack of an agreement. The CBI then approached the Gujarat Forensic Science Lab to verify the findings of the Karnataka lab. The Gujarat FSL confirmed the ballistic findings linking the three cases, according to sources.\nGauri Lankesh Murder- Last Rites Of Veteran Journo Performed At Chamrajpet Cemeter\nOn January 20 this year, the Bombay High Court noted that CBI had not been provided a report by the Scotland Yard forensic lab on the findings made by the Karnataka lab in the murders of the rationalists but had accepted a report of the Gujarat FSL and allowed it to be used as evidence by the CBI in the Dabholkar murder case.\n“The Scotland Yard Police have informed the CBI in writing that unless and until a Mutual Agreement is arrived at, and in the absence of the clearance from the UK Home Department, it would not be possible to examine the materials and render any definite and conclusive opinion,’’ the court noted. “At this stage, we must also note the fact that the report, now being available for the CBI (the report of the Director of Forensic Sciences, Gujarat), is likely to be placed on the record of the criminal case, and particularly, the Sessions case arising out of the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar.’’\nAlthough activists of the Sanatan Sanstha have emerged as the primary suspects in the case, the Karnataka SIT is also pursuing investigations on other lines and on Wednesday questioned family members of Lankesh and some associates whom she had helped move out of the Naxal movement into the mainstream.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "8e213119_in", "news_id": "2a2a087d6cf73b7b3fd832d61b2332d6_in", "title": "Gun used to kill Gauri Lankesh is the same one that killed M M Kalburgi: forensics", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/gun-used-to-kill-gauri-lankesh-is-the-same-one-that-killed-m-m-kalburgi-forensics-4842625/"}

ae6cc99d_in	{"content": "A fourfold hike in parking fees and polluting industries will be shut down if Delhi’s air quality degrades from ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ in coming days.\nTen thousand pollution masks (N95) were distributed among Delhi Traffic Police personnel to minimise the impact of toxic air at Traffic Police Headquarters, in Pusa, New Delhi on Tuesday.(Vipin Kumar/HT Photo)\nThe Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday implemented a series of measures, such as imposing a ban on diesel generator sets and temporarily shutting down the Badarpur thermal power plant, to curb pollution levels in the national capital region during the winter.\nThe Supreme Court-mandated panel warned that further steps, including effecting a fourfold hike in parking fees and shutting down polluting industries, will be implemented if the air quality degrades from ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ in the coming days. “Hopefully, the city won’t witness such severe pollution levels this time. Otherwise, we will have no alternative but to shut down everything from vehicles to schools — bringing the entire city to a standstill,” said Sunita Narain, EPCA member and director of the Centre for Science and Environment.\nThese measures are part of a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) that came into force from Tuesday to address air pollution concerns in the national capital and its surrounding areas. The air quality in Delhi has already reached ‘very poor’ (AQI 308) levels, and experts have warned that it may turn ‘severe’ (AQI 401-500) on October 20 — the day after Diwali. \nBrick kilns that don’t run on zig-zag technology, which reduces emissions by up to 75%, were also temporarily shut down by the EPCA. “Next, we may need to take drastic steps such as hiking the parking fees by at least three-four times, banning hot-mix plants (for road construction), and shutting down stone crushing units if the air quality deteriorates further,” said Narain. At present, municipalities charge a car parking fee of Rs 20 for the first hour.\nHowever, the EPCA clarified that measures such as the odd-even car rationing policy — which restricts movement of private vehicles on the basis of their licence plate numbers — and closure of schools will be taken only as a “last resort” under the action plan’s emergency segment. \n “The moisture level is increasing, and we expect foggy conditions on Diwali night. Too much smoke due to firecrackers and vehicular emissions could result in smog, which may linger for the next 24 hours,” said A Sudhakar, member-secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Delhi experienced its worst ordeal with smog in 17 years right after last year’s Diwali celebrations. \nCPCB data revealed that pollution at three places — Delhi’s Anand Vihar, Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad and Rajasthan’s Bhiwadi — has already hit ‘severe’ levels. “As these are the most polluted places in the region, they will be our first targets. We will analyse the reasons and take immediate action,” said EPCA chairman Bhure Lal.\nEPCA members fear that their attempts to reduce air pollution in Delhi could be negated by the limitations of its public transport system. “The ridership of Delhi’s bus fleet is declining. GRAP places heavy emphasis on intensifying the use of public transport systems during periods of high pollution. All our efforts may go down the drain if that is lacking,” said Narain.\nIn 2016, the Delhi government had launched the odd-even rationing scheme on city roads when air pollution reached critical levels.\n", "domain": "hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "ae6cc99d_in", "news_id": "c87b6e09b8f1ed3bbc74afb291ac0052_in", "title": "Diesel genset banned, Badarpur thermal power plant shut as Delhi air turns ‘very poor’", "ts": 1508296534, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/diesel-genset-banned-badarpur-thermal-power-plant-shut-as-delhi-air-turns-very-poor/story-uBmbffd5g9OxxlPg3Z2BNO.html"}

His finance minister (Arun Jaitley) is working over-time to make sure that all Indians also see it from equally close quarters.\" \nThat is how senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha ended the scathing op-ed column that he wrote for The Indian Express on the massive slowdown hitting the Indian economy.\nSinha wrote that he would be \"failing in (his) national duty\" if he did not speak up right now. He also claims that his views reflect the \"sentiments of a large number of people in the BJP and elsewhere\" and that these people aren't speaking up \"out of fear\". \nEconomy is turning out to be the main headline in Modi's India following depressing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures in the last quarter, when, at 5.7 per cent, it had hit its three-year low. Earlier this week, the government reconstituted the 5-member Economic Advisory Council, which Sinha calls the \"fiva Pandavas (who) are expected to win the new Mahabharata for us\". \nSinha calls the controversial demonetisation decision taken in November 2016 by Modi as \"an unmitigated economic disaster\" and says the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a \"hurriedly-conceived and poorly-implemented\" policy.\nSinha, a respected economist and former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, is also considered as one of the best finance ministers in recent times. His son Jayant Sinha won the 2014 elections from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand and is currently Minister of State for Civil Aviation in Modi's cabinet.\nATTACK ON 'SUPERMAN' JAITLEY \nIn his piece, Sinha reserves the most scathing words for Arun Jaitley, calling him a \"lucky finance minister, luckier than any in the post-liberalisation era\". He admits that Jaitley is believed to be the \"best and the brightest\" in the Narendra Modi government, and that the current finance minister's \"indispensability\" was established when he was given four ministries after the BJP's landslide victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. \nJaitley still retains three of those ministries (with Defence now being handled by Nirmala Sitharaman), Yashwant Sinha notes. But, not even \"a superman like Jaitley\" can do justice to the task of multi-tasking between a portfolio that includes the demanding finance ministry, Sinha writes. \nBut Jaitley has made a \"mess\" of it, Sinha writes at the beginning of his piece. \nHe squandered a golden opportunity when he took over the management of the Indian economy, Sinha goes on to essentially say. \"Depressed global crude oil prices placed at his (Jaitley) disposal lakhs of crores of rupees,\" Sinha says. \"But the oil bonanza has been wasted and the legacy problems (stalled projects and bad loans) have not only been allowed to persist, they have become worse.\" \nSINHA SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER: OPPOSITION\nA number of Opposition leaders from the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Left joined Sinha in slamming the Modi government over its performance in economy. \n\"Yashwant Sinha speaks Truth to Power. Will Power now admit the Truth that economy is sinking?\" tweeted another former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram.\n\"Very hard hitting article by Shri Yashwant Sinha ji,\" said Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal on Twitter. \nIncidentally, Sinha is not the first from the BJP to raise a red flag over the slump. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy and former Union Minister Arun Shourie have also attacked the government and warned it of dire consequences if the mess in the economy is not contained.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "902af318_in", "news_id": "b971523f417523a6057c9647592ad92f_in", "title": "Yashwant Sinha, ex-finance minister, attacks PM Modi, Arun Jaitley on economy", "ts": 1506495243, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/yashwant-sinha-arun-jaitley-narendra-modi-indian-economy-gdp/1/1056772.html"}

\n A. यह बाबा महिलाओं का माइंडवाश करके उनसे अकेले में मिलता-जुलता रहता था और उन्हें फंसाता था। धार्मिक कार्यों में महिलाओं का ही रोल रहता है। बाबाओं का गुणगान करती हैं। इसलिए उनकी तादाद ज्यादा रहती है। \nQ. आपके बीच पैसों का लेन-देन था। क्या कोई इश्यू है। बताया जा रहा है कि आपने भी कुछ पैसा दिया था? \n A. नहीं-नहीं पैसों का कोई इश्यू नहीं है। हम तो इनको पैसा इस तरह से समर्पण किए हैं कि बता नहीं सकते। सच कहें तो हमने तो पैसा लुटाया है। बहुत दिया है हमने तो इन्हें। \nQ. बताया जा रहा है कि आपका 6-7 करोड़ रुपए हैं?\n A. इतना नहीं है जो दिया है वो सारा पैसा रिकॉर्ड में हैं। चित्रकूट आश्रम, गाड़ी के अलावा कुंभ में भंडारा करवाना सहित कई बार स्वेच्छा से पैसा दिया है। \nQ. आपकी बेटी अकेली यहां क्यों आई, पहले भी दोनों बहने यहां आई थी और काफी दिन रुकी थी?\nA. पहले हम खुद ही लेकर आए थे। मेरी छोटी बेटी बीमार थी, दिल्ली एम्स में इलाज कराने के लिए आए थे। हमारी मन्नत मेहंदीपुर बालाजी में थी। उस समय ये बोले की यहां ले आओ हम पूजा पाठ कराएंगे। \nQ. बेटी का अकेले आना कहीं बाबा को फंसाना तो नहीं था? \n A. नहीं ऐसा नहीं है, राखी का दिन था, बेटी की एक ही दिन की छुट्टी थी। दोपहर के बाद ग्रहण लगा था। शाम को मंदिर बंद रहा था। फलाहारी ही भक्तों से दोपहर में कह रहे थे कि राखी बंधवाओं और दर्शन कर लो फिर मंदिर बंद हो जाएगा। \nQ. ऐसा भी कहा जा रहा है कि कहीं छोटे महाराज तो आपके साथ पूरा खेल नहीं खेल रहे हैं। क्योंकि आपके इनसे भी अच्छे संबंध थे?\n A. ऐसा नहीं है ये दोनों सगे मामा-भांजे हैं। फलाहारी की बड़ी बहन का बेटा है सुदर्शनाचार्य। इसका एक बड़ा भांजा है बालमुकुंद जो यूपी में कॉलेज चलाता है। खेल की कोई बात ही नहीं है। \nQ. पुलिस ने आश्रम से क्या-क्या जब्त किया है? \n A. पुलिस को आश्रम से जड़ी बूटी, दवाइयां, लैपटॉप, सीडी, पायल, महिलाओं से संबंधित कई आइटम मिले हैं। \nQ. आपको क्या लगता है अब क्या होना चाहिए? \n A. इसकी पूरी संपत्ति जब्त कर सरकार अपने पजेशन में ले। \nQ. लोग कहते हैं कि 30 साल से बाबा से जुड़े हैं, ऐसा कोई प्रकरण नहीं आया। आपका क्या कहना है? \n A. इसके सभी कार्यक्रमों की सीडी निकलवाकर देखी जाए। लोग क्या-क्या घोषणाएं करते हैं। छत्तीसगढ़ के लोग अंधभक्त हैं और बहुत दान दिया है। \nQ. पुलिस ने दो दिन में क्या किया है? \n A. पुलिस पूरा पंचनामा बना रही है। कोर्ट के आदेश की इंतजार में है। यह बाबा मायावी है, मेडिकल ग्राउंड पर बहाना बनाकर भर्ती हो गया है। इसलिए ठोस काम कर रही है पुलिस। \nQ. आपसे कल और आज क्या-क्या बात हुई? \n A. बिलासपुर में जीरो एफआईआर हुई थी। सब कुछ वही हुआ है। वहां के बयानों को क्रास चेक किया है और पीडि़ता के मुंह से सुनना चाहते थे। जगह को आइडेंटिफाई कराना था। \nQ. रात को तस्दीक में क्या हुआ? \n A. सिर्फ एक बच्चे की तस्दीक हुई है बाकी को इसने भगा दिया। इस स्कूल का रिकॉर्ड जांच कराया जाए, यहां सरकार और भक्त लोगों का पैसा लगा हुआ है। \nQ. बाबा का कितना करोड़ का कारोबार होगा? \n A.  इसके पास बहुत प्रॉपर्टी है, जमीन, जायदाद, आश्रम कई जगह हैं। \nQ. लोगों का कहना है कि बाबा तो किसी को छूते तक नहीं थे, डंडे से ही आशीर्वाद देते थे? \n A. यही तो बात थी इसकी का फायदा उठाया कि डंडे से दिन में आशीर्वाद दो और रात में तेल मालिश और पैर दबवाओ। इनका एक दिन निर्धारित रहता था जिसका प्रचार वाॅट्सऐप से करते हैं कि एक निश्चित दिन जड़ी-बूटी देते हैं। जिससे बच्चा पैदा होता है। \nQ. आपके बयान में बेटी को शहद लगाने की बात आई थी, यह तो वृद्ध था आपकी बेटी ने विरोध क्यों नहीं किया? \n A. यह बाबा मायावी है, हम खुद इसकी हकीकत बहुत बाद में पहचान पाए। बेटी तो हक्की-बक्की रह गई कि जिसको बचपन में खिलाया और उसके बाद ऐसा कृत्य हो तो क्या करती। फिर भी मौका मिलते ही वह निकल गई। \nQ. घटना जिस समय की बताई जा रही है लोगों की उस समय भीड़ रहती है फिर यह सब कैसे संभव हुआ? \n A. उस दिन ग्रहण का दिन था सिर्फ स्कूल के बच्चे ही वहां थे। मेरा यही कहना है कि जो लोग इसे छोड़कर गए हैं उन्हें बुलाया जाए और गहन पूछताछ की जाए। सब कुछ साफ हो जाएगा। इन्हें 15 से ज्यादा अजीज लोग छोड़कर जा चुके हैं। \nQ. ऐसा तो नहीं है कि मंदिर में दूसरा पुजारी नियुक्त हो गया और भांजा पूरा खेल कर रहा हो? \n A. मैं बता चुका हूं कि यह बाबा मायावी है। यहां मंदिर के आस-पास मीणा परिवार है जिनकी बुराई वहां छत्तीसगढ़ में करता था और वहां की यहां करता था। मंदिर निर्माण में तो भक्तों का पैसा लगा है। मैं स्वयं इसमें ट्रस्टी हूं। रजिस्ट्रार कार्यालय में देखो छत्तीसगढ़ के कई ट्रस्टी हैं इस मंदिर में। \nQ. बेटी ने बयान में बाबा के हवाले से दूसरी बहन का जिक्र किया था, कहां तक सही है? \n A. बाबा ने वह बात अपने मन से कही है। बेटी ने बयान वहीं दिया था जो बाबा ने कहा। \nQ. छत्तीसगढ़ में बाबा आपके यहां रुकते थे क्या? \n A. बाबा का 2008 से पूरा इंतजाम मेरे घर ही रहता था। हमने इनको रुकने की पूरी जगह दी हुई थी। इनके साथ आने वाले 10 से 15 लोगों का इंतजाम वहीं रहता था। भंडारा टाइप चलता था। हमने इसे अपना बाप, भगवान सब माना हुआ था। कल्पना नहीं की थी कि जो बच्चों को खिलाएगा उसका यह रूप भी देखने को मिलेगा। \nQ. आप यदि खुलासा नहीं करते तो क्या करते, इससे आप भी बच सकते थे? \n A. मान-सम्मान को ठेस लगी इसलिए सामने हूं। मैं इनके भक्तों से अनुरोध करता हूं कि फलाहारी से डरे नहीं खुलकर अपनी बात सामने रखें।\n", "domain": "bhaskar.com", "entry_id": "546c3cf3_in", "news_id": "b6680fa8bc0bb521572543b3aacf5ee4_in", "title": "लड़की के पिता ने बताई फलाहारी बाबा की सच्चाई, ऐसे फंसाता था महिलाओं काे", "ts": 1506138695, "url": "https://m.bhaskar.com/news/RAJ-JAI-HMU-interview-with-falahari-baba-case-victim-father-5702124-PHO.html?ref=hf"}

fe7993d1_in	{"content": "It is clear that if Shinzo Abe wants a third term beyond 2018, he could do with all the help he gets. And who better to turn to than his old pal Narendra Modi?\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie Abe visit Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad on September 13, 2017. (REUTERS/Amit Dave)\nNew Delhi: There has been a lot of talk about the ‘campaign-like’ atmosphere associated with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Ahmedabad. A lot of political commentators compared Wednesday’s road show from the airport to Sabarmati Ashram to an election road show.\n Many even argued that this was Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounding the political bugle in his home state Gujarat which goes to the polls in two months.\n Forget about Modi for a moment, it is Shinzo Abe who needs this visit to shore up his sagging popularity ratings back home. The Abe administration suffered a major setback in July when it lost the Tokyo gubernatorial elections.\n A new start-up party, Tokyo First, run by former LDP leader Yuriko Koike, secured a shock victory by defeating Abe’s party, the LDP. For the first time Abe’s invincibility was shaken.\n Then in August, there was a major corruption scandal in which Abe’s former defence minister and someone who was being groomed as his successor, Tomomi Inada, was forced to resign.\n Abe had to usher in a major cabinet reshuffle, wherein he had to make way for rivals within his own party. Former defence minister Itsunori Onodera was brought back.\n Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida was moved to a very powerful position within the party. Many say he may launch a run for LDP leadership next fall, before the general elections.\n Back to the scandal that cost Abe’s protégé her job, this involved a famous school Moritomo Gauken in which the allegation was that Abe’s wife Akie Abe had donated a million yen and the government had given land to the school at throwaway prices.\n While the probe did not directly implicate Abe or his wife, there is a sense in Japan that the Abes managed to save themselves by the skin of their teeth.\n Meanwhile, Tokyo Governor Koike is expected to launch a run for Prime Ministership next year. Her candidature, if it happens, is expected to strike a chord among many Japanese, as her pitch would be to get elected as Japan’s first woman Prime Minister.\n If she manages to win, it will be revenge served cold to Abe. After all, Koike left the LDP after a bitter parting of ways with Abe. This explains why major Japanese newspapers on Thursday had front page articles and photographs of Abe with Modi in the roadshow in Ahmedabad. This helps shore up Abe’s popularity ratings which have sunk below 40 percent.\n Abe, much like Modi, believes in personalised diplomacy. He was one of the first world leaders to call on US President Donald Trump much before he even formally took over the presidency in January this year.\n Abe had managed to control much of the damage caused by Trump’s outspoken comments during the campaign when he said that “Japan must pay for its own security”. Trump had also called for a return of American soldiers serving in Japanese bases.\n But all this has gone awry with North Korea’s frequent provocations, including last week’s hydrogen bomb test. \n Japan has the most stake in reining in North Korea’s abhorrent behaviour because its security is directly threatened. Abe’s conservative, strongman image threatens to be peeled off by an erratic 31-year-old dictator, Kim Jong-Un, to his immediate west.\n Four years on, Abe’s much touted macro-economic policies, coined ‘Abenomics’ have failed to show any magic. The Japanese economy continues to be subdued. Japan’s trade with major partners, including India, has been decreasing in the last few years. It is especially worrying that with both US and Europe showing signs of a turnaround, Japan still continues to lurk dangerously close to deflation territory.\n It is clear that if Abe wants a third term beyond 2018, for which the LDP’s party constitution was amended, he could do with all the help he gets. And who better to turn to than his old pal Modi? \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "fe7993d1_in", "news_id": "14b2588b48487be34bfb0317ffd7fc45_in", "title": "Why Japan's Shinzo Abe Needed This India Visit More Than PM Narendra Modi", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/why-shinzo-abe-needed-this-india-visit-more-than-pm-modi-1517973.html"}

(IE photo) \nThe University Grants Commission (UGC) last month decided to implement a new formula for reservation in teaching posts in the university. Now, if Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) decides to accept the decision, it could result in lesser positions for SC, ST and OBC faculty on university campuses. As per the report by the Indian Express, UGC took a decision that the number of reserved faculty posts shall now be calculating according to the departments in a university and not based on the aggregate posts. P S Krishnan, the former secretary to the central government and an expert on the subject, was reported as saying that the proposed change could result in fewer positions for SCs, STs and OBCs.\nWhile hearing a case on teachers’ recruitment in Banaras Hindu University in April this year, the Allahabad High Court held that reservation in teaching posts has to be applied department-wise by treating the department as a “unit” and not the university. The court criticised UGC for applying reservation in a “blanket manner” and advised the regulator to revisit its implementation. As per the report, the new formula came in as the response to a verdict of the court.\nThe number of SC, ST, OBC faculty positions currently are calculated by treating the university as a “unit”. This practice grouped or clubbed together all the reserved quota for all posts of the same grade, across different departments in a university. If the new UGC formula is accepted by the HRD ministry, the reservation would be applied by treating each department in a university as a “unit”. This means the number of reserved posts at the same level will be determined separately for each department; calculated based on the total posts in each department.\n", "domain": "financialexpress.com", "entry_id": "2ade2d87_in", "news_id": "835e1449eede7c78433ffabe1937f3d6_in", "title": "UGC mulls reducing SC, ST, OBC faculty posts; here is all you want to know", "ts": 1508738811, "url": "http://www.financialexpress.com/jobs/ugc-mulls-reducing-sc-st-obc-faculty-posts-here-is-all-you-want-to-know/902563/"}

With Rajinikanth's support - and his famous comment that even God couldn't save Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa came back - the DMK swept the state polls in 1996.\n Months after Jayalalithaa, a former film star, died in office, the two superstars are vying for the spot she left vacant.\n Some see it as an extension of their silver screen rivalry in a state where many top politicians were film stars first, including Jayalalithaa and her mentor MGR or MG Ramachandran.\n While Kamal Haasan calls himself an atheist and rationalist, and declares that his colour is not saffron, Rajinikanth's spiritual leaning is seen to complement the BJP ethos.\n Kamal Haasan is outspoken while Rajinikanth is reticent, even self-effacing. Kamal Haasan is at ease spouting Tamizh illakiyam (Tamil Literature) as much as John Milton and Shakespeare.\n Rajinikanth doesn't speak much. But when he does, fans hang onto every word, interpret every nuance and quote him on various platforms as though it is gospel.\n Unlike Rajinikanth's ambiguous statements, Kamal Haasan has been clear about his political debut. But Rajnikanth's tweet today was seen as a message that he's still in the reckoning.\n In May, he had told his fans he'd call them when there's a war. When he meets them again next month, a political announcement will be greatly anticipated.\n The two actors have shared screen space in some iconic films in the 1970s, very often with Kamal Haasan playing the straight-laced hero and Rajinikanth the stylish villain with shades of grey.\n Kamal Haasan has said they are willing to act together again, but on the political stage this time. There is no villain here. The only dispute could be on who will be the star and who will direct.\n", "domain": "ndtv.com", "entry_id": "24337a8_in", "news_id": "d416df4d3b3c238c3c3691c1a9d28876_in", "title": "A Rajinikanth Tweet After A Kamal Haasan Admission: Tale Of 2 Netas-In-Waiting", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/a-rajinikant-tweet-after-a-kamal-haasan-admission-tale-of-two-netas-in-waiting-1754008?google_editors_picks=true"}

On the second-day of his visit, he would be holding talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and newly appointed Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\nAhead of his visit, the statement issued by Pentagon said the Defence Secretary would be “appreciating” the efforts taken by India towards reconstructing democracy in Afghanistan.\nDelhi, over the past few years, has spent billions of dollars towards construction of roads and dams in the war-torn nation. In the past year, it also inaugurated the new Afghan Parliament building, which has been funded by Delhi. An aid of US$ 1 billion was also dispatched to Kabul by Modi regime last year.\n“The United States views India as a valued and influential partner, with broad mutual interests extending well beyond South Asia,” the Pentagon statement said.\nWhile presenting his strategy for South Asia region last month, President Trump said he is looking forward towards India’s “enhanced role” in reviving the Afghan economy. On the other hand, he lambasted Delhi’s arch-rival Pakistan, accusing it of harbouring the “same terrorists who are targeting US troops” in the region.\nApart from the Afghan crisis, Mattis’ visit is also intended, experts say, to persuade India towards entering into a deal with US’ arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, for the supply of F-16 Block 70 aircraft. The deal is pegged at US$ 15 billion.\nThe Indian Defence Ministry, so far, has been weighing its options, as proposal requests have also been sent to Sweden’s Saab, Russia’s MiG, apart from Lockheed Martin and Boeing, another American arms supplier.\nThe government, as per reports, is looking to procure at least 100 single-engine fighters to counter the growing air threat posed by China and Pakistan.\nAccording to analysts, the possibility looms over India inking the arms agreement with the US-based suppliers, especially amid the growing defence bonhomie between New Delhi and Washington. In 2016, US had designated India as a “Major Defence Partner”, which was followed by President Trump’s assertion that he “wants to boost military ties with India”, earlier this year.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "8d6bc0de_in", "news_id": "5a4d3efb69f249b50dcdbe9bfeabe2b1_in", "title": "Fighter Jets, Drone Deals to Feature in Talks as US Defence Secretary James Mattis Visits India", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://www.india.com/news/india/fighter-jets-drone-deals-afghan-crisis-to-feature-in-talks-as-us-defence-secretary-james-mattis-visits-india-2494232/"}

Modi now follows a little over 1800 handles, a list that still includes people he has been criticised for following.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was under attack from rivals a day after senior journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh was murdered in Bengaluru on September 5. He was berated for following some Twitter handles which had abused Gauri and celebrated her killing.\nHowever, the BJP defended PM Modi saying he never blocked or unfollowed anyone on Twitter. The party also said Modi following someone on the micro-blogging site is \"not a character certificate\".\nIn the latest development, PM Modi followed some more handles on Twitter on Sunday, his 67th birthday. He followed 59 new handles. The total number of handles he follows now has jumped from 1779 to 1838 now.\nOf the 59 handles Narendra Modi followed, 23 are verified accounts.\nSPORTS PERSONS\nFormer Australian cricketer Brett Lee wished the prime minister on his birthday. Later, the PM thanked him and also followed him.\nThank you. https://t.co/yUKoiqAYK6\n- Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 17, 2017 \nPM Modi already follows two wrestler Phogat sisters Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. He followed the third one Ritu Phogat on Sunday.\nEX-SERVICEPERSONS\nThe prime minister followed at least two ex-servicemen. One of them is Major DP Singh whose bio states that he is a Kargil war survivor.\nMajor Singh is also the first amputee marathon runner of India and a Limca record holder, as per his bio.\nMajor Gaurav Arya, who shot into fame for defending the NDA government after the September 29 surgical strikes, was also followed by PM Modi.\nBJP FUNCTIONARIES\nThe prime minister followed a number of party functionaries of different states. Prominent among them are BJP's national spokesperson and head of media department Anil Baluni, party's IT Cell co-convenor Manish Pandey and National Council member Balraj Passi.\nDIGNITARIES\nThough PM Modi followed Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu even before he was elected to the post, he now also follows the vice-president's official Twitter account.\nNarendra Modi was the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel in July. He developed personal rapport with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On his birthday, the PM followed Israel's Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka Daniel Carmon.\nGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\nOne of those followed by PM Modi is NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar who succeeded Arvind Panagariya in August. The PM also followed former senior bureaucrat Shakti Sinha who joined the BJP in July.\nJOURNALISTS AND WRITERS\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi already follows a number of journalists and writers. He followed some more on Sunday. Some of them are Navika Kumar, Anjana Om Kashyap, Rohit Sardana, Rahul Shivshankar, Vamsee Juluri, Amish Tripathi, Vikram Sampath, Arnab Ray, Vishweshwar Bhat and Ishaan Prakash.\nPROFESSIONALS\nPM Modi followed some professionals too. Among them is lawyer Afroz Shah, whose bio states that he is also an ocean lover, beach cleaner UN Environment's champion of the earth.\nAmit Thadhani, a practising surgeon was also followed by the PM. Thadani claims also to be a musician, social activist and amateur photographer.\nModi followed Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) School of Languages faculty member Makarand R Paranjape. The JNU professor was stopped by JNU Students' Union members in February from entering his offices. He managed to enter the office after threatening the students with satyagraha and touching their feet.\nRIGHT-WINGERS\nA large number of handles that PM Modi followed are of the right-wingers. While a few of them are verified accounts, most of them are non-verified.\nThese handles belong to persons or organisations who call themselves staunch Hindus (Shefali Vaidya and Jyotsana Varma), proud nationalists (Aman Rai and Pranjal Chaudhari) and fearless sanyasi and headstrong nationalist (Sadhvi Jaya Bharti).\nMISCELLANEOUS\nWhat may surprise some is that PM Modi has decided to follow some funny handles. One such handle (@IndiaSpeaksHR) is named 'FoolishOfficer'. Besides being an unverified account, it has the DP of Bollywood comedian Johnny Lever.\nNOT UNFOLLOWED OR BLOCKED ANYONE\nAs BJP had stated, Modi has neither unfollowed nor blocked anyone, not even a person like Nikhil Dadhich who had posted obnoxious comments on the murder of Lankesh.\nThe PM still follows Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh who had posted an abusive tweet last week. A similar tweet was repeated by Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari on Sunday.\nSimilar is the case with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who had called the PM \"coward and psychopath\" on Twitter. Modi has not unfollowed or blocked him. \nModi also follows other rivals such as corruption convict and RJD president Lalu Prasad and scam accused former Bihar chief minister Tejashwi Yadav. The father-son duo have always been attacking the PM on and off the social media.\nAs the BJP stated, Modi also follows Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who is an accused in the National Herald scam case.\nThe PM has not stopped following someone like Navjot Singh Sidhu who quit the BJP and joined the Congress. Similarly, he still follows Lok Sabha MP Kirti Azad who has been suspended by the BJP for attacking Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.\nThough some in PM Modi's list have died, he is still following them. They are former Union Environment Minister Anil Dave and BJP MP from Gurdaspur and Bollywood actor Vinod Khanna.\nHence, it is almost clear that however much his rivals will create brouhaha, PM Modi will neither unfollow nor block someone like Nikhil Dadhich who are accused of bullying, trolling and posting tweets abusive of women and the rivals.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "ff189bd8_in", "news_id": "716ef947607657be422bcb53651f2131_in", "title": "PM Modi starts following 59 new handles on Twitter, does not unfollow or block trolls", "ts": 1505793179, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-following-new-handles-on-twitter-does-not-unfollow-or-block-trolls/1/1051009.html"}

September 5, 2017 will go down in history as the day when Android One was re-launched albeit under a slightly different set of rules and guidelines.\nAt the helm of Android One's second innings is Xiaomi, a company often called, the Apple of China. And the device in question, at the helm of Android One's second innings, is the Mi A1.\nThe Xiaomi Mi A1, just like Google's Android One phones of yore, is a cost-effective handset geared towards emerging markets like India with promised timely OS updates right from the global search engine giant. Only it's unlike any Android One phone that you've seen before. The Mi A1 is notably the most premium phone, both in terms of looks and build as well as in terms of hardware specs, to launch under Google's Android One program. This is a stark departure from what Google's Android One stood for, once upon a time. The times they are a-changin'. For the better, hopefully.\nDesign and build quality\nThe Mi A1, much like any other Xiaomi phone, looks (and feels) like an expensive phone, but it isn't expensive at all. Boasting of a full-metal body and dual rear cameras, the Mi A1 would -- invariably -- remind you of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus, especially from the behind. The same is true about the phone's front as well. Everything from the 2.5 D curved glass -- which is Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 for your reference -- on the front to the antenna lines placement on the back, screams the iPhone. The only visible difference is seen in the fingerprint scanner placement. As opposed to the iPhone 7 Plus that comes with a front-mounted fingerprint scanner, the Xiaomi Mi A1 sports one on the back. The Mi A1 further comes with physical capacitive keys on the front which are back-lit.\nThe Mi A1 may look remarkably like the iPhone 7 Plus, but, at least it looks good while at it. Also, it costs peanuts in comparison, so that's that. You'll have to dig a little deeper to understand its design philosophy though. The Mi A1, in fact, borrows heavily from Xiaomi's gentle giant, the Mi Max 2: you can call it a smaller Mi Max 2 if you may.\n\"It's pretty, the Mi Max 2. Had it been a more mainstream phone with a more mainstream size, the Mi Max 2 could have been the best looking phone at under Rs 20,000,\" is what I had written about the Mi Max 2's design not long ago, clearly smitten by its single slab of metal design. The Mi A1 was the mainstream phone that I was looking for back in the day and now that it is here, well, let's just give some credit where it's due. The Mi A1 is, without a doubt, the best looking phone at under Rs 20,000 right now. Period.\nThat's not to say that it's without its flaws though. The Mi A1 that takes great pride in its aesthetically pleasing curves can be tad slippery and unmanageable at times. The fingerprint scanner on the back, although it's mostly fast and accurate, isn't in the same ballpark as the one on-board the Redmi Note 4.\nDisplay\nThe Mi A1 comes with a 5.5-inch Full-HD LTPS display that amounts to 1080x1920 pixels (403 ppi pixel density) and 450nit brightness. Unlike Xiaomi's Redmi Note 4 and Mi Max 2, the screen of the Mi A1 can get really bright and also because it's not as reflective as the aforementioned phones, the Mi A1 offers better overall outdoor legibility in comparison.\nXiaomi could have done a better job with the screen's colour reproduction though. The Mi A1 can get really bright, but, colours on-board aren't always the most accurate: they seem muted and lacking in contrast. The Redmi Note 4 certainly did a better job at colour reproduction, but then, it wasn't as bright as the Mi A1, so I guess, you win some and you lose some.\nSoftware\nXiaomi's custom ROM, aka MIUI, although it offers a seamless experience across the board, is known for some heavy skinning on top of Android, something that hard-core geeks don't really appreciate. Also, because there's third-party skinning involved -- and because Xiaomi likes to update each and every device in its portfolio more or less on similar lines -- the fact that users have to wait longer for updates, doesn't go down well with many. That besides the fact that the company is known to kill some key Android features just so it can maintain uniformity across its devices is a subject of much debate.\nTake the Redmi Note 4 for instance. When Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 4 in India in January, the phone shipped with Android Marshmallow (based MIUI 8). In early August, the phone started receiving the Android 7.0 Nougat update (MIUI 8.5) alongside the July Android security patch. Interestingly, the Redmi Note 4 -- as per a Xiaomi listing -- isn't scheduled to get Android 7.1 although an update to MIUI 9 is expected in the days to come. If Xiaomi's listing is to be gone by, chances are the Redmi Note 4 may be stuck with Android 7.0 for the rest of its life. To expect an Android Oreo upgrade from it, would be wishful thinking for now.\nThe Mi A1 is essentially a Xiaomi phone running stock Android and to cut short the chase here: it flies like no other phone at its price point\nJust so you know, Xiaomi's phones are in no way inadequate -- or inferior -- in software standards to counterparts. It's just that Xiaomi operates in an entirely different manner. Xiaomi doesn't toil with Android AOSP APIs. Rather, the company adds its own features on top of the AOSP. A lot of this happens at the ground level which is why -- for most users -- there would generally be very little visible difference between a Marshmallow-based MIUI and a Nougat-based MIUI.\nA lot of this also happens without changing an Android version. It is the MIUI version that one would see changing at all times, and going by went sXiaomi's history, the company is in the habit of changing that way too frequently. Xiaomi's phones may not always boast of the latest version of Android, but, they most certainly aren't losing out on much anyways, according to Xiaomi. This also helps Xiaomi to keep updating all its phones no matter the release window.\nBut there is still an audience, and a sizable one at that, that would still take Android Nougat over Marshmallow and it would want it as quickly as possible. That's where Xiaomi's new Mi A1 steps in. Not only would the Mi A1 pack in the latest and greatest in Android at all times, it would be the closest thing next to what a certain Google Pixel has to offer at the end of the day: unadulterated software.\nThe Mi A1, for your reference, runs stock Android 7.1.2 Nougat out-of-the-box and will be updated to the recently announced Android Oreo by the end of this year, Xiaomi has confirmed. Xiaomi (and Google), in fact, have gone so far as to say that the Mi A1 will also be getting Android P -- or whatever Google decides to call the Android O successor -- when it launches later next year.\nUnlike a certain Nokia 6, or a Moto G5S Plus, or a Lenovo K8 Plus -- that all run a stock version of Android Nougat out-of-the-box -- however, the Xiaomi Mi A1 is the closest it gets to pure unadulterated Google software. Both Lenovo and Moto phones ship with extra apps and features, in addition to a slightly tweaked (non-Pixel) launcher. Both Lenovo and Moto are expected to roll out Android Oreo for many of its key phones, but there's no definite time-line for the same. The same is true about the Nokia 6 (the Nokia 5 and the Nokia 3) as well. The Mi A1 Android One-based phone, meanwhile, is pretty well sorted in this regard.\nHaving said that, although the Xiaomi Mi A1 runs a near 100 per cent version of stock Android, the phone also ships with the company's Mi Feedback and Mi Remote apps. While the purpose of the Mi Feedback app is to let users report issues with the phone, the Mi Remote app allows users to use the Mi A1's IR-blaster. While the Mi Remote app can be uninstalled, the Mi Feedback app can't. Also, the camera app in the case of the Mi A1 is again hallmark Xiaomi. This is because the stock Google camera app can't do dual camera gimmickry like taking portrait shots at this point of time, according to Xiaomi.\nPerformance and battery life\nThe Mi A1 is powered by a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clubbed with Adreno 506 GPU, 4 gigs of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a hybrid micro-SD card slot. The Snapdragon 625, which is also inside the company's much popular budget phone the Redmi Note 4 (as also inside the gigantic Mi Max 2), is notably the first Snapdragon 600-series chipset to be built on the power-efficient 14nm finfet process. The technology essentially allows a processor -- the Snapdragon 625 in this case -- with multiple cores to hit higher clock speeds without overheating and draining the battery quickly. In layman's terms, you're more likely to get (much) better battery life and little (or no) overheating in phones powered by a chipset on the lines of the Snapdragon 625.\nIt's safe to say that the Mi A1 offers the best dual camera implementation on a mid-level budget phone right now\nThe Snapdragon 625 has worked its magic in the Redmi Note 4 (as also the Mi Max 2). The Mi A1 has the same processor, but, unlike the Redmi Note 4 (as also the Mi Max 2), the Mi A1 has stock Android at its core. The combination -- a deadly one at that -- ensures the Mi A1 feels faster in almost every sense of the word in comparison to the Redmi Note 4 that runs MIUI: a custom ROM based on Android. There is of course some room for improvement and hopefully, the next-generation Android One phones from Xiaomi would be a little more refined, especially in terms of touch latency, but overall the Mi A1 paints a pretty picture.\nIt's safe to say that the Mi A1 doesn't disappoint, as far as regular day-to-day usage is concerned. And also, it runs mostly cool while at it. It is quick and responsive in every sense of the word and there were no drastic visible lags or stutter while navigating between home screens and/or multitasking in my review unit. The Mi A1 handles basic games quite well. Graphics-intensive games are prone to some lag especially during extended usage.\nThe bottom-firing mono speaker on-board the Mi A1 can get loud but there is often some digitization at peak volume. Phone calls made with the phone are of excellent quality and we did not encounter any odd call drop issues with our review unit.\nThe 3,080mAh battery inside the Mi A1 may not inspire the same level of confidence as the 4,000mAh+ and 5,000mAh+ batteries inside the Redmi Note 4 and the Mi Max 2, but, it should easily get most users through a full working day without any hiccups. Extreme usage scenarios got us close to 11 hours on the Mi A1 which is a fairly respectable score.\nThe phone charges over USB Type-C -- which is a first for any budget-orientated offering from Xiaomi -- and the company is also including a custom 380V charger in the box that it says is designed to handle India's notorious voltage fluctuations.\nCamera\nThe Mi A1 comes with a dual camera setup on the rear -- 12-megapixel + 12-megapixel -- where one lens is wide-angle while the other is telephoto (or zoom lens). The Mi A1, is in fact, the first Xiaomi phone in India to ship with dual cameras.\nIn terms of core specifics, the 26mm wide-angle lens on-board the Mi A1 comes with an f/2.2 aperture while the 50mm telephoto lens boasts of an f/2.6 aperture. This dual camera system offers 2X optical zoom and 10X digital zoom (just like the iPhone 7 Plus) and therefore should technically result in clearer distant shots and professional bokeh effects in portraits. The system is further aided with phase detection auto-focus and a dual-LED (dual-tone) flash but there is no optical image stabilisation. On the front, the Mi A1 comes with a 5-megapixel camera.\nDual cameras are fast becoming the industry norm, even in the mainstream segment. A lot of them don't do much though. A lot of this also has to do with the fact that a lot of the phones at under Rs 20,000 with dual cameras don't offer the complete package. Dual cameras exist as mere luxuries and solve no real world purpose. The Mi A1 changes all this. Not only does the Mi A1 offer a complete package with respect to paper specs, it's the closest that you can get as far as realizing them in actual usage is concerned. In fact, it's safe to say that the Mi A1 offers the best dual camera implementation on a mid-level budget phone right now.\nThe Mi A1 literally excels at portrait shots when the lighting is ideal, offering crisp and detailed shots and a creamy background, with little or no blurry edges. The same is true about indoor shots under good artificial lighting as well. The Mi A1's dual cameras will, in fact, surprise you at how good they can be at their low price. Just don't expect the moon from them however. The Mi A1, especially its USP portrait mode, is a disappointment in low light. Zoom shots taken with the Mi A1, meanwhile, are fairly respectable for taking reference shots.\nAs far as normal photography is concerned: the Mi A1 captures some good-looking photos -- with occasional softness -- in good light with good amount of detail and mostly spot-on colours. Also, the Mi A1, surprisingly, does well in macro photography scenarios which means close-up shots come out well (enough) when the light is adequate.Xiaomi's new phone is also able to capture well to-do photos -- with occasional softness -- in tricky light situations with good detail. Low light photos are prone to noise.\nShould you buy it?\nXiaomi may go to great lengths to claim how good the Mi A1 looks and feels and does in the camera department, but, the real star of the show here is the software. The Mi A1 is essentially a Xiaomi phone running stock Android and to cut short the chase here: it flies like no other phone at its price point.\nThere's no denying that Xiaomi makes some great hardware at rock-bottom prices. But the recent turn of events in the market -- with major companies lining up to offer stock Android in their phones -- seems to indicate, there's a growing demand for unadulterated software, now more than ever. That's probably why Google also felt that it was the right time to invest in Android One, one more time, see how it goes.\nIf phones like the Mi A1 are the future of Android One, well, let's just say, Google's much-ambitious initiative to connect the next billion, is off to a great start as far as redemption stories are concerned. The Xiaomi Mi A1, as far as I can tell, has every ingredient in the book to make fans (and critics) fall in love with, and the first valiant effort from house Google to resurrect Android One and make the platform count.

India has already surpassed Japan as the world's third largest oil consumer and is expected to overtake China. \n But Aramco, traditionally India's top oil supplier, has not found the going smooth in such a growing market in the face of challenge from fellow Opec member Iraq. \n According to a Reuters report, Iraq remained India's top oil supplier for the fifth month running in August. \n Besides, India is also leveraging the oversupplied condition of the global oil market and flexibility of its refineries to tap new sources such as the US. \n No wonder, Aramco's talks with Indian state-run refiners are not limited to locking in sale of crude but also encompasses increased LPG supplies and a foothold in petrochemicals and fuel retail businesses. \n Saudi Arabia accounts for approximately 19% of India's crude and 29% of LPG imports. During 2016 -17, India imported about 39.5 million tonnes of crude from Saudi Arabia. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "b07340bb_in", "news_id": "c672e52fd2755cfd340495930c49013a_in", "title": "Saudi Aramco plugs into India’s oil growth story", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/saudi-aramco-plugs-into-indias-oil-growth-story/articleshow/60998636.cms?utm_source=toiandroidapp&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=show"}
a957872f_in	{"content": "In terms of the capital or reserve fund, the amount set aside by parties after subtracting liabilities from assets for party expenditure, the BJP scored the highest with Rs 869 crore in 2015-16.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi with the BJP national president Amit Shah at the party's Parliamentary Board meeting in June 2017.(PTI)\nThe ruling BJP is the richest among India’s seven national parties, having declared assets worth nearly Rs 894 crore in 2015-16, said a report released by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) on Monday.\nThe document collated by the advocacy group went on to term the Congress, which declared assets to the tune of Rs 759 crore in the same period, as a close second on the list. While the BJP was found to have declared liabilities of around Rs 25 crore during that time, the figure for the Congress stood at Rs 329 crore.\nThe report was based on the declaration of assets and liabilities by national parties from 2004-05 to 2015-16. While assets include moveable and immovable properties, cash, vehicles, investments, deposits, loans and advances, liabilities comprise factors like borrowings from banks, unsecured loans and access to overdraft facilities.\nIn the 11-year period that came under ADR scrutiny, the Congress possessed more assets than the BJP until 2014-15 – the year of the great saffron triumph. The BJP did better than the grand old party the next year too. \nIn terms of the capital or reserve fund, the amount set aside by parties after subtracting liabilities from assets for party expenditure, the BJP scored the highest with Rs 869 crore in 2015-16. This was followed by Rs 557 crore of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rs 432 crore of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n The reserve fund of the BJP increased by 700% through the 11-year period, as opposed to 169% of the Congress. The highest percentage increase in this respect was seen by the Trinamool Congress (13,447%) and the BSP (1,194%), the report said. \nThe average total assets declared by the seven national parties stood at Rs 61.62 crore in 2004-05, and rose to as much as Rs 388.45 crore by 2015-16. The value of the BJP’s assets, amounting to Rs 123 crore in 2004-05, increased by around 627.15% in 11 years. The Congress’ assets grew by 353.41% during this period.\nThe BJP said the rise in income and declared assets is a reflection of its ongoing campaign to usher transparency in funding. “Donations are being received in cheques, and we are building offices in each district and raising corpus that will provide interest for meeting party expenditure. All tax returns are duly filed, and we have decided to operate a single centralised bank account to ensure transparency in donations,” said BJP spokesman Gopal Agarwal.\nThe loss in the last general elections did not seem to have greatly affected the Congress in terms of fixed assets, which witnessed only a marginal dip of Rs 65 crore – from 767 crore in 2013-14 to 702 crore in 2014-15 — but went up to Rs 758.79 crore the next financial year.\n A Congress functionary said on the condition of anonymity that the party’s collections come largely from concerted membership drives executed across the country, besides investing in safe instruments. \nThe BJP’s total assets went up from Rs 464 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 781 crore the next year, followed by Rs 894 crore in 2015-16. Without much liability, the BJP’s reserve fund also witnessed an almost corresponding increase — from Rs 437 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 869 crore in 2015-16.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "a957872f_in", "news_id": "54d91bc4e0011a572ad21348e218dec3_in", "title": "BJP richest party with Rs 894 cr, Congress second with Rs 759 cr: ADR report", "ts": 1508259541, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-richest-party-with-rs-869-cr-cong-not-far-behind-with-rs-759-cr-watchdog-report/story-UgwJEhvEC6oimadGPEkD0M.html"}

Both the children were neighbours and often used to visit each others house. The girl’s parents approached cops after she described the incident to her mother.

Economic Times reports both Vodafone and Idea are in talks with local smartphone makers Lava and Karbonn to jointly roll out their own variants of cheaper 4G devices. \nAirtel announced partnership with Karbonn on Wednesday to launch the Karbonn A40 Indian, a 4G smartphone at an effective price of Rs 1,399.

Now, even Vodafone and Idea want to grab a share of the 500 million plus feature phone users who are yet to jump on 4G networks. \nGaurav Nigam, Product Head at Lava, told ET that the company is in talks with all three telecom operators to offer 4G enabled devices at subsidised rate. Lava and Karbonn are reportedly not planning to discount their existing smartphones, but rather looking at telcos to offer plans that would lead to lower effective price for the device. \nThe battle between Reliance Jio and other telcos to attract those nearly 500 million feature phone users is now turning into a feature phone versus smartphone contest. Reliance Jio calls its JioPhone as a smart feature phone, but Karbonn and Lava will be offering smartphones running Android and access to over million apps from Google Play Store. Vodafone also has a pact with iTel for feature phones but this deal is likely different from existing partnership. \nWhile Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are strategising plans to tackle JioPhone, users will have to decide whether they want to lock themselves to a plan that calls for mandatory recharge over a period of three years. \n      ​ \n", "domain": "digit.in", "entry_id": "3a689d33_in", "news_id": "28d225aea4f5006ba6c9a1fd406b948c_in", "title": "Vodafone and Idea plan to challenge JioPhone and Karbonn A40 Indian from Airtel", "ts": 1507881676, "url": "https://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/vodafone-and-idea-planning-to-compete-jiophone-and-karbonn-a40-indian-from-airtel-37554.html"}

a66d956e_in	{"content": "नई दिल्ली [स्पेशल डेस्क] । इसमें अब कोई शक नहीं है कि पाकिस्तान आतंकवाद का निर्यातक देश है। कई अंतरराष्ट्रीय मंचों पर ये आवाज उठ चुकी है कि अब पाकिस्तान को पुख्ता कार्रवाई करनी होगी। लेकिन एक सच ये भी है कि आतंकवाद के मुद्दे पर पाक दोहरे मानदंड अपनाता है। हाल ही में अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री रेक्स टिलरसन ने पाकिस्तान दौरे में साफ-साफ कहा कि अब किसी तरह की बहानेबाजी नहीं चलेगी। ट्रंप प्रशासन ने कहा कि पाकिस्तान को आतंकी संगठनों के खिलाफ कार्रवाई करनी होगी। ऐसा नहीं होने पर अमेरिका अपने ढंग से जो उचित होगा वो करने से नहीं हिचकेगा। \nपाक करे कार्रवाई\nअमेरिकी विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता हिथर नॉट ने कहा कि एक बार नहीं हजारों बार आतंकवाद के मुद्दे पर पाकिस्तान से चिंता जाहिर की गई है। पाकिस्तान को ये समझना होगा कि आतंकी संगठन जहां कहीं से भी कारनामों को अंजाम दे रहे हों उनके खिलाफ कार्रवाई करनी ही होगी। अपनी यात्रा के अंतिम चरण में जब टिलरसन जेनेवा पहुंचे तो उन्होंने कहा कि आतंकवाद के मुद्दे पर पाकिस्तान से रचनात्मक बातचीत हुई है। पाकिस्तान ने इस बात का भरोसा दिया है कि वो आतंकी संगठनों के खिलाफ कार्रवाई करेगा।लेकिन अगर वो ऐसा नहीं करते हैं तो अमेरिका अपने ढंग से निपटेगा। टिलरसन ने कहा कि पाकिस्तान को संदेश साफ है। अमेरिका चाहता है कि पाकिस्तान वो करे जो हम चाहते हैं। हम उनसे कार्रवाई की उम्मीद कर रहे हैं, अमेरिका कुछ मांग नहीं रहा है। पाकिस्तान एक संप्रभु देश है, वो वहीं करें जो करना चाहते हैं लेकिन इस बात को समझें कि हम किस चीज को जरूरी समझते हैं।\nटिलरसन ने कहा कि वो विस्तार से ये तो नहीं बताएंगे कि क्या कुछ बात हुई थी। लेकिन चर्चा के दौरान 80 फीसद समय बातचीत के विषय को सूचीबद्ध करने पर और 20 फीसद समय सिर्फ बातचीत के लिए निर्धारित किया गया। हालांकि टिलरसन की यात्रा से ठीक पहले पाकिस्तान के विदेश मंत्री ख्वाजा आसिफ ने नेशनल स्टैंडिंग कमेटी के सामने कहा था कि हम न तो अमेरिका के सामने आत्मसमर्पण करेंगे और ना ही अपनी संप्रभुता के साथ समझौता करेंगे। आसिफ ने कहा था कि अमेरिका ने आतंकियों की कोई सूची नहीं सौंपी थी। गौरतलब है कि अमेरिका ने 75 आतंकियों की सूची के साथ साथ हक्कानी नेटवर्क के खिलाफ सख्ती बरतने को कहा था। आसिफ के इस तरह के बयान पर अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्रालय की प्रवक्ता ने कहा कि टिलरसन अपनी बात को स्पष्ट तौर पर रख चुके हैं।\nजानकार की राय\nJagran.Com से खास बातचीत में अंतरराष्ट्रीय संबंधों के जानकार हर्ष वी पंत ने कहा कि आतंकवाद के मुद्दे पर ट्रंप प्रशासन का रुख कड़ा है। हाल ही में कनाडाई-अमेरिकन जोड़ी की रिहाई में देखा भी जा सकता है। अमेरिका के लिए अफगानिस्तान एक बड़ी चुनौती है और वहां के रणनीतिकारों को लगता है कि भारत की सक्रिय मदद से वो अफगानिस्तान में अपनी भूमिका को और बढ़ा सकते हैं। अमेरिका को लगता है कि एक तरफ पाकिस्तान खुद को आतंकवाद से पीड़ित बताता है। लेकिन आतंकी संगठनों के मुद्दे पर उसकी परिभाषा अलग होती है। पाक के दोहरे व्यवहार पर अंकुश लगाने के लिए अमेरिकी रक्षा मंत्री जेम्स मैटिस पहले ही ट्रंप से अपील कर चुके हैं।\nभारत की कूटनीति आ रही काम\nआतंकवाद के मुद्दे पर भारत दुनिया के दूसरे देशों को ये समझाने में कामयाब हुआ है कि पाकिस्तान की कथनी-करनी में कितना अंतर है। 2016 में गोवा के ब्रिक्स सम्मेलन के दौरान भारत की तरफ से ये कोशिश की गई कि जैश और लश्कर का नाम घोषणापत्र में शामिल किया जा सके। लेकिन चीन ने अपना विरोध दर्ज जताया। लेकिन एक साल बाद वैश्विक समीकरण में बदलाव और भारत की सफल कूटनीति की वजह से चीन के शियामेन शहर में आयोजित ब्रिक्स सम्मेलन की तस्वीर कुछ और ही थी। चीन ने भी ये माना कि भारत में आतंकवाद के पीछे लश्कर और जैश का हाथ है। इसके साथ ही हक्कानी नेटवर्क का भी जिक्र किया गया। हक्कानी नेटवर्क को लेकर अमेरिकी प्रशासन को पहले से ही संदेह रहता था कि वो मदद लेकर अफगानिस्तान में आतंकियों की मदद करते हैं। लेकिन जब अमेरिका को इस बात के पुख्ता प्रमाण हासिल हुए कि आइएसआइ की सरपरस्ती में हक्कानी नेटवर्क काम कर रहा है तो ट्रंप प्रशासन ने सख्ती बरतनी शुरू कर दी। अमेरिकी रुख में पहला बदलाव ये था कि रक्षा मंत्री जेम्स मैटिस ने पाकिस्तान की यात्रा नहीं की। इसके साथ ही पिछले पांच साल से बंधक बनाए गए कनाडाई-अमेरिकन जोड़ी के मुद्दे पर अमेरिका ने साफ कर दिया कि अगर हक्कानी नेटवर्क पर पाकिस्तान ने कार्रवाई नहीं की तो वो सीधी कार्रवाई करेगा\nपसंद-नापसंद का मुद्दा नहीं है आतंकवाद\nअमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री रेक्स टिलरसन ने 19 अक्टूबर को अमेरिका के शीर्ष थिंक टैंक CSIS में अपने संबोधन में कहा था कि ट्रंप प्रशासन को उम्मीद है कि पाकिस्तान अपने देश में मौजूद उन आतंकवादी संगठनों के खिलाफ निर्णायक कार्रवाई करेगा, जो उसके अपने लोगों और सीमावर्ती क्षेत्र के लिए खतरा बन गए हैं। आतंकवाद की मुसीबत से निपटना हर सभ्य देश की जिम्मेदारी है और यह पसंद का मामला नहीं है। अमेरिका और भारत इस क्षेत्रीय कोशिश की मिलकर अगुआई कर रहे हैं। टिलरसन का भारत के साथ संबंधों में दिए गए बयान को अमेरिकी रुख में एक बड़े बदलाव के तौर पर देखा जा रहा है। टिलरसन ने चीन और पाकिस्तान को आड़े हाथ लेते हुए कहा था कि बीजिंग की उकसावे वाली कार्रवाई उन अंतरराष्ट्रीय कानूनों के खिलाफ है जिनके भारत और अमेरिका पक्षधर

c2352209_in	{"content": "Two weeks after deadly stampede on Elphinstone Road-Parel foot-over bridge in Mumbai, the Western Railway, in a report, has pinned the blame on rumours and rains for the tragedy, ruling out the issue of poor infrastructure or negligence on part of the railways staff.\nTwenty-three lives were lost on 29 September due to the tragic incident that occurred on the narrow bridge that connects Elphinstone Road station on the Western Railway with Parel station on the Central Railway.\nFile image of Elphinstone Road station where a stampede took place on Friday. PTI\nAfter gathering statements from nearly 30 survivors, a high-level Western Railway committee absolved the railways authorities. \"The committee found that the cause of the incident were rumours and rain. The confusion between 'phool' and 'pul' resulted in the chaos. No one was responsible for it,\" Western Railway chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar was quoted as saying by Mumbai Mirror.\nThe report, however, makes several suggestions in order to prevent similar incidents in future. These include installation of additional CCTVs, removal of all encroachments, and a ban on heavy luggage during peak hours. The report, which was compiled by five senior railways officials, blamed rain and not the poor infrastructure in and around the two stations.\nThe report also suggested improving the clarity (resolution) of CCTV cameras and that the footage should be accessible to the station master, relocation of the ticket booking office at the Elphinstone Road station and deployment of Railway Protection Force (RPF) during peak hours.\nThe committee also proposed utilisation of the booking office space to upgrade the foot-over bridge and usage of wireless handsets among the authorities for better communication. The report also said that if the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts heavy rainfall and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also warn about the same, the station should announce the update to avoid chaos.\n\"We will study all the recommendations by committee and implement most of the suggestions as early as possible,\" Bhakar told Firstpost.\nOne of the survivors had earlier told the RPF that it was a flower vendor's 'phool gir gaya' (flowers have fallen) cry which was misinterpreted by the commuters as 'pul gir gaya' (the bridge has collapsed).\nMeanwhile, defending the Western Railway, the CPRO said that a new bridge has been sanctioned. \"It's not like we ignored warnings before the incident,\" the CPRO said. Acknowledging the lack of trained staff to handle difficult situations like the 29 September incident, Bhakar said, \"The survivors who spoke to us said that the rumour was created all of a sudden. The people were unprepared for the rains. In seven to eight minutes, this rumour turned the situation into a stampede.\"\nHe said: \"The infrastructure is inadequate. There are many reasons. The work is not happening at the rate it should. The reason is that we get about two and a half hours block to work.\"\nHe praised the authorities' move to bring foot-over bridges under the safety category from the earlier 'passenger amenity' category and confirmed that getting approvals to improve the foot-over bridge would, hence, become easier.\nHours after the tragedy, the Western Railway had released a statement saying that the rains were \"unprecedented\" and that commuters at the station \"were caught unaware\". Western Railway maintained its stand in the recent report as well saying, railway commuters, 'unprepared for the rains', gathered on the Elphinstone-Parel foot overbridge, using the bridge's roof to shelter themselves from the sudden rain.\n\"There was no structural damage to the foot-over bridge which can be attributed to the stampede,\" the release said, India Today reported. It mentioned that the bridge was five meters wide.\nThe railways had also said CCTV cameras would be installed in all the suburban trains in Mumbai within 15 months, and subsequently, across the country.\nThe incident had prompted Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to order a high-level inquiry. He also assured to widen foot-over bridges across the suburban railway system. A 2016 Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report had specifically highlighted the structural defect in the Elphinstone Road-Parel foot-over bridge.\nWe are turning a 150 year old convention on its head, hereafter, FOBs (Foot Over Bridges) will be deemed mandatory not a passenger amenity.\n— Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) September 30, 2017\nThe width of the bridge had been a concern raised by several commuters prior to the incident. \"We had given a letter to the railway administration six months ago with a request to do something to improve the shoddy state of affairs here,\" a commuter had told PTI.\nFormer railway minister Suresh Prabhu had also released Rs 11.8 crore for building a new foot-over bridge in the area after the Shiv Sena drew his attention to the matter. However, the project never took off and its current status is a mystery.\n", "domain": "firstpost.com", "entry_id": "c2352209_in", "news_id": "ba2dd9dc5b3451334f99010fec0b391b_in", "title": "Mumbai stampede: Western Railway report blames rains, absolves authorities", "ts": 1507728560, "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/india/elphinstone-road-stampede-western-railway-report-blames-rains-and-rumours-absolves-authorities-4131575.html"}
3c79be9b_in	{"content": "There's both hope and doubt in the Congress as the 'reluctant' dynast overhauls his image before taking over as party president.\nRahul will lead the Congress; Sonia will remain UPA chief. (Photo: PTI)\nImmersed in a bunch of legal papers in his tastefully furnished office in one of Delhi's leafier neighbourhoods, a high-profile lawyer, who also happens to be a Congress leader, offers a simple diagnosis of what ails the party- an overdose of democracy. He calls it the biggest irony of Indian democracy. \"We are a party run by dynasts who practise too much democracy in taking decisions in an attempt to please and accommodate everyone, and end up taking no decision at all,\" said the Supreme Court advocate. \"In contrast, the BJP is a democratic party where two men autocratically take all decisions-right or wrong-that are followed by everyone. This difference explains the success and failure of the two national parties of India.\"\nLike in court, he offers evidence. Just before the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year, the Congress spent three months deciding where and how Priyanka Gandhi would campaign. In the end, after several rounds of deliberations, it was decided she would campaign only in Raebareli and Amethi. \"So much time was wasted just to decide that she would continue doing what she has been doing till now,\" said the party leader. And many such decisions are still being awaited. Himachal Pradesh is going to the polls later this year. There is a demand that the ailing Virbhadra Singh, who also faces corruption cases, not be given another chance to lead the party. In Madhya Pradesh, where assembly polls are due next year, both veteran leader Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party's Lok Sabha chief whip, are hoping to be the chief ministerial face. It is not clear even now who will lead the party in the Gujarat elections scheduled for the year-end.\nThe Congress's national roadmap, too, remains vague. Almost every leader India Today spoke to said that the party must first be revived in the states, where future leaders with mass appeal will be nurtured. That can happen only when the Congress is strengthened at the grassroots, with the empowerment of block and district units and booth committees. Just before his famous Vipassana break in 2015, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had submitted to his mother a blueprint for the party's revival. It mostly revolved around these suggestions, but has been gathering dust. Most leaders perceived to be close to party president Sonia Gandhi claim decisions are pending because of Rahul. Seventy-year-old Sonia, who has reportedly been in poor health of late, has delegated most of the authority to Rahul. \"He must take decisions,\" said veteran party leader Digvijaya Singh, who was once considered Rahul's political mentor. \"People loved Indira Gandhi because she was decisive. Narendra Modi takes decisions-good, bad or indifferent. Not taking a decision has hurt the party most.\"\n There have been some decisions every now and then, though. Digvijaya was removed as general secretary in-charge in Goa and Karnataka after the Congress failed to assume power in the former this year despite winning more seats than the BJP. In Karnataka, the largest Congress-ruled state, 55-year-old Kerala MP KC Venugopal, who is often seen sitting next to Rahul in the Lok Sabha, was appointed general secretary in-charge. Mohan Prakash, one of Rahul's favourite number-crunchers, has been removed as general secretary in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, much to the delight of Digvijaya, Scindia and Nath.\nIf those rumoured close to Rahul are to be believed, more radical decisions will follow once he becomes party president. It's almost certain Rahul will contest for the position in the Congress organisational polls scheduled next month-he said as much during his speech at the University of California, Berkeley. Sonia, says a source close to her, is against Rahul contesting elections. She fears someone else may throw their hat in the ring, causing embarrassment since Rahul's popularity among the cadre is suspect. A Congress general secretary, however, said Rahul is adamant on taking the chair through an electoral process, and any challenge to his candidature is highly unlikely. Added Abhishek Singhvi, a Rajya Sabha MP of the party, \"The Congress must bite the bullet and decide on Rahul as the president. Irrespective of the reasons, there must be no further delay.\"\nAnother general secretary in-charge of several states, claimed the pace of decision-making and the party's core structure will change once Rahul takes over. The process, he said, has already begun, young leaders such as A Chellakumar and Venugopal are being given charge of states in place of veterans who once handled multiple territories. But even this process lacks consistency. Two Rahul favourites, Mohan Prakash and Madhusudan Mistry, have got the axe for 'non-performance', whereas former Union minister CP Joshi, who remained a mute spectator to his party losing power and several leaders in Assam, Bihar and Manipur, still holds charge of the entire Northeast, Bihar and West Bengal.\nJoshi claimed it's unfair to evaluate Rahul's performance since he is yet to assume the top post. \"Sonia took charge in 1998 and the party came to power (at the Centre) after six years. Rahul has not even started yet,\" he said. Joshi forgets that Rahul has been part of the decision-making process for over a decade, as he admitted in Berkeley. In an attempt to take credit for bringing peace in Jammu and Kashmir, he revealed that he had been working closely with the UPA governments- a clear departure from his earlier stand that he had been blamed for government decisions he was not a part of.\nSeveral Congress leaders say Rahul's speech in Berkeley lays bare his revival plan for the party and also indicates his changed approach to the rhetoric against him. For the first time, he did not defend his dynast tag, instead putting it as an integral part of Indian politics. But he underscored that he would take the democratic path to the top by contesting elections. To the relief of party veterans, Rahul indicated that his probable core team would be a blend of the old and the young. He candidly admitted that though he used to push for younger leaders, he now needed the \"talented old brigade\" to run the organisation. There have been several indicators of this already-most significantly the resurgence of Manmohan Singh, who is being fielded to attack the Narendra Modi government on multiple issues, from GDP to Kashmir.\n In what was perhaps Rahul's first attempt to directly counter his image as a reluctant politician, as publicised by \"1,000 BJP men, sitting on computers\", Rahul challenged the UC Berkeley students to judge his intellect on the basis of what he said. \"He needs to do many such mass contact programmes in India,\" said Digvijaya. Rahul appears to have also woken up to the power of social media in today's politics.\nMost significant is his emerging strategy against PM Modi for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He has accepted that he can't match Modi's oratory. He understands that attacking the PM over initiatives such as Make in India in an environment high on nationalistic rhetoric will backfire. Instead, he is choosing to hit the government where it hurts the most-on the economy and jobs. Post-demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Rahul talked of reorienting Make in India to benefit small and medium entrepreneurs. He reminded the youth that the government has been creating 500 jobs a day instead of the required 30,000. He mentioned growing communal violence and intolerance, knowing it would resonate with Muslims and Dalits. Rahul started his speech by equating liberals like him with the tribal people whose wisdom saved them from the 2004 tsunami in the Andamans, a reach-out to another core constituency.\nAvoiding a direct battle with Modi, Rahul has picked another enemy - the RSS. With two defamation cases slapped on him by RSS activists, his focus on the organisation is understandable. Also, the RSS's nationwide grassroots network has been helping in the BJP's expansion. \"It's an ideological battle as he thinks the RSS is against what India stands for,\" explained Digvijaya. Some party leaders, however, find it foolish to target a cadre-based organisation like the RSS with just ideological noise. \"If he doesn't strengthen the party at the grassroots, forget the RSS or BJP, you cannot fight even the AAP in Delhi,\" said a Congress leader from Delhi.\nBut does he have an election strategy for 2019? Joshi made it sound pretty simple. Get the non-BJP parties that did well in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on board. \"The Bihar (assembly election) experiment proved that the BJP can be defeated,\" said Joshi. However, getting parties like the SP, BSP, RJD, TMC, Left, BJD and DMK under one umbrella could prove to be too big a test for Rahul's leadership. \"That's why Sonia Gandhi will continue as UPA chief even after Rahul takes charge of the Congress,\" said a young Lok Sabha MP.\nFor now, Rahul has waved the white flag to the veterans, got ready to take the plunge, demarcated his constituencies and identified his main enemy. A big handicap remains, though. He needs an issue to win polls. At Princeton University, he declares his issue - joblessness which brought Modi to power will also bring his downfall.

(Source: IE image) \nHave you been using Sarahah and posting the comments on Facebook and Twitter? Bad news for you. The anonymous messaging app is secretly uploading all the information on your computer and PC to its servers. According to a report in The Intercept, Sarahah is getting all your email addresses and contact details and storing them on its servers. The report has cited a security analyst at Bishop Fox, named Zachary Julian. He discovered this fact when he downloaded the Sarahah app on this mobile. Even Zain al-Abidin has acknowledged this. However, interestingly, if we go by what Sarahah says in its privacy policy, it says that it does not collect user data.\nJulain revealed that the Sarahah app, which describes itself as an ‘honest messaging service’, upload whole contact books to its servers. The analyst informed that he found this feature when he got the on his Galaxy S5, which runs the Android Lollipop version. The report in The Intercept said that the phone has a software called BURP Suite. It basically ‘intercepts internet traffic entering and leaving the device’. It was this software which found that the Sarahah app was getting Julian’s private information. He said that the aim ‘transmits all of email and phone contacts stored on Android.’ The report adds that a similar thing happens on Apple devices as well.\nThe analyst has shared a video (on Vimeo) which shows us how Sarahah violates user privacy and gets data without consent. Initially, Tawfiq did not respond but later said that this feature was kept to help in the next update only to be removed later. He reasoned that this feature would help in letting users find their friends on Sarahah. This makes little sense since the whole idea of the app is to be anonymous.\nTawfiq said that it is a tech issue and was supposed to be removed from the app. However, it still brings up concerns about user privacy and how various mobile applications have been treating your data. Julain also mentioned that even if a user does not use the app, still it uploads contact again and again. Clearly, it is an indication that Tawfiq has known this all along.\nThis main issue is not taking the data, but the fact that it has been taking the data without asking for it.

(AFP File Photo)\nUnion and state governments collected R90,669 crore as goods and service tax (GST) in August, 3.6% less than what was collected in July, the first month of the indirect tax reform, as businesses and traders attempted to settle down in the new system despite technology hiccups. \nA finance ministry statement on Tuesday said these receipts do not include taxes from over a million small assessees who have opted a liberal quarterly tax payment system. \nOnly a little more than half of the 6.8 million assessees who were required to remit taxes and file returns met the deadline, said the statement. It implies that either the actual receipts may go up further as many who missed the last date opt for paying taxes with interest, or many taxpayers who got migrated from the earlier tax system to GST are not required to pay. \nBusinesses with at least Rs 20 lakh turnover are required to pay GST, a threshold higher than the Rs 10 lakh that existed earlier for service tax and Rs 5-10 lakh that existed for value added tax (VAT). An automatic migration of all taxpayers from the earlier system to the new one would mean that some of the registered GST payers may eventually forfeit their registration since they do not reach the Rs 20 lakh threshold. \nSome experts said the low level of compliance needs to be studied. Abhishek A Rastogi, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co. called it an “alarming fact.” \n “The government should go to the root cause and analyse whether these assesses are facing some genuine problems or they have been migrated automatically and are not required to comply,” he said.  \nIn August, central government’s share of GST stood at Rs 14,402 crore while states collected Rs 21,067 crore. Integrated GST or IGST which is collected on inter-state commerce and imports stood at Rs 47,377 crore. Of this, imports accounted for Rs 23,180 crore.\n“The above figures obviously do not include the GST to be paid by 10.24 lakh assessees who have opted for the composition scheme (meant for small taxpayers). Additionally, there are still a number of assessees who have not filed their return either for July or August, 2017,” said the ministry statement. \nAbhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY India, said it was too early to hazard a guess on overall GST collections as many taxpayers have still not paid GST. Besides, there is inconsistency in collections because of transitional credit and exporters not being able to claim refund of GST. “Things would settle down only in the next few months,” said Jain.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "421f2385_in", "news_id": "8486270a696393a017263ecd70ccebce_in", "title": "Two months of GST, tax collection falls 3.6% in August", "ts": 1506493439, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/business-news/two-months-of-gst-tax-collection-falls-3-6-in-august/story-fUfxQANS3mfp5M8RK8cuXO.html"}

She has worked her charm on the entire country, thanks to her numerous films, both critically and commercially successful. \nBut if there is one facet of Rekha's life that has been shrouded in mystery since the day people saw her with Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan in Silsila, it is her rumoured affair with Amitabh Bachchan.\nBack in the late-seventies, these stars had gossip columns overflowing with rumours of their affair. \nOn Rekha's 63rd birthday, today, we take a look at the love story that no one quite knows the truth about.\n1. Rekha has gone on the record to profess her love for Amitabh time and again. On their part, the Bachchans, Amitabh and Jaya, have mostly maintained a stoic silence on the matter for decades now. \n2. Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha were seen together on the big screen for the first time in Do Anjaane.\n3. Filmmaker Yash Chopra was the one who pulled off a casting coup of sorts for his film Silsila, thereby adding a lot of fuel to the fire. The film went on to almost symbolise what was supposedly happening in Amitabh, his wife Jaya Bachchan and Rekha's lives back then.\n4. In a by-now famous episode of Rendezvous With Simi Garewal, the host asked Rekha several questions about Amitabh. Later, Simi opened up on how she asked Rekha questions about Amitabh. Simi said, \"It was easy asking her the question about Amitabh. If I can ask Jayalalitha if she was ever loved MGR, asking Rekha about Amitabh was much easier. A lot of people ask me how I got her to open up. I didn't know if I did anything special. I don't want to analyse it. I just chatted as good friends. Rekha and I go back a long way.\"\n5. Rekha spoke about her experience of working with Amitabh, on the same episode. When Simi asked Rekha what as an actor Amitabh brought to Rekha's life, she answered, \"Well, I think I had arrived, so to say. In many ways, I'm senior to him. But, standing in front of Amitabh Bachchan, the ultimate actor, was not easy.\"\nAmitabh Bachchan and Rekha\n6. Rekha went on to talk about working with Bachchan in Do Anjaane, \"The moment I came to know that Amitji had signed Do Anjaane, I was so paranoid. Because Deewar had just released. He was a phenomenal success. I knew him as Didibhai's (Jaya Bachchan) husband. First of course, boyfriend, and then husband. I never knew him otherwise, because we never got a chance to sit and talk. When I started working with him, I was so nervous... I really, really learnt a lot. It changed my perception of what being on the set is like. It was never a playground for me again.\"\n7. Amitabh was like something she had 'never seen before', said Rekha on the show. \"I was never impressed by the ordinary. And he was like something I had never seen before. I have never seen him, ever, express pain,\" the actor said.\n8. Rekha said she was baffled by how one person could have so many good qualities. She gushed, \"Personally, I think you can say... when you're fascinated by something, subconsciously, even without realising it, you just pick up everything. And when I found this person, and I had never met anyone like him... He is a fellow Libran. How can so many good qualities be bestowed upon one human being? Not fair.\"\n9. Then came the million-dollar question that nearly everyone in the country had been waiting to ask Rekha and Amitabh. Simi Garewal stepped in for everyone else and asked it on behalf of them: Did Rekha fall in love with Amitabh? Her oft-quoted answer to that question was, \"Absolutely! Duh, that's a dumb question!\" And then went on to generalise that statement, \"I'm yet to come across a man, woman, child, who can't help but fall completely, passionately, insanely, desperately and especially, hopelessly, in love with him. So why should I be singled out?\" \n10. Rekha then went on to say, \"You want to know the truth? There was never a personal connection with him. That's the truth. What do I deny? I'm not in love with him? Of course I am. Duniya bhar ka love aap le lijiyega and add some more - I feel that for that person. Bottomline.\"\nThat 'bottomline' is what has dominated drawing-room discussions for many decades now. The truth, however, is something only Rekha and Amitabh are aware of.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "6cb9b8fe_in", "news_id": "845d2341d522bd0a5c0d9a7da3d8e07e_in", "title": "Amitabh-Rekha's untold love story: 10 lesser-known things about their relationship", "ts": 1507707803, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amitabh-rekha-untold-love-story-affair/1/1065310.html"}

7b9e99c6_in	{"content": "While Bharat 1 has almost all features of JioPhone, Micromax’s 4G VoLTE feature phone will also run WhatsApp and Facebook in the future. Read our detailed first impressions.\nBharat 1 comes with an unlocked SIM, which essentially means users can run any network SIM on the device(HT Photo)\nSince the debut of Reliance JioPhone in August, the interest in the entry-level mobile phone market has revived. This segment of phone users, long forgotten by smartphone makers, still account for a large chunk of the market. According to Counterpoint Research, close to 200 million 4G feature phones will be sold in India in the next five years. The estimate is not small by any standards and signifies the importance of India’s untapped, under-Rs 2,000 mobile phone market.\nReliance Jio may have gained the first-mover advantage, but rivals are catching up fast. Airtel, earlier this month, responded with a sub-Rs 2,000 4G VoLTE Android smartphone made in partnership with Karbonn.\nDomestic smartphone brand Micromax joined the bandwagon on Tuesday with its Bharat 1 4G VoLTE feature phone. Priced at Rs 2,200, Bharat 1 comes bundled with a Rs 97 monthly-plan from BSNL under which users get unlimited voice calls and data.\nMicromax’s Bharat 1 comes with almost same features as the JioPhone, except for the built-in voice assistant. The Bharat 1 comes in a candy bar design with alphanumeric keypad and a four-way navigation button at the centre. It has a removable back panel encasing a detachable battery, dual SIM slots and microSD slots. The base has a microUSB port and 3.5mm-audio jack, and the top an LED flash (torch).\nThe Bharat 1 has a fairly standard feature-phone design, which in our opinion is not bad. Considering the consumer base it’s targeted at, the standard design brings a sense of familiarity. The stark contrast between the JioPhone and Bharat 1 is the software.\nBharat 1 Key Specs\n2.4-inch QVGA display\nQualcomm 205 processor + 512MB of RAM\n4GB built-in storage (32GB expandable)\n2,000mAh battery\n2MP rear camera, VGA front camera\nWi-Fi, Wi-Fi hotspot,dual-SIM, dual 4G, VoLTE,Bluetooth\n Running KAI operating system, the user interface on the JioPhone is quite similar to most Android smartphones. Micromax, however, has taken a simpler route by adding bigger app icons. While I felt the JioPhone was quite easy to use, the Bharat 1, with its minimalistic approach, seems easier to navigate. Though how you feel about its looks is purely subjective. \nRunning a tweaked version of Android, the Bharat 1 comes with a “Micromax Entertainment” application that gives access to Live TV, music, movies and videos. During our brief usage, we could play the popular kids channel, Pogo. The video streaming quality was pretty okay, though we were using a high-speed Wi-Fi network. We are yet to find out how consistent the mobile network experience is on the phone.\n Facebook and WhatsApp apps will arrive on Bharat 1 in a month’s time. \nIf you remember, one of the biggest criticisms that JioPhone faced was the absence of popular social applications such as Facebook and WhatsApp. The demo unit of Micromax Bharat 1 which we used at the launch event on Tuesday also did not have the two apps. But a senior company executive told us that Facebook and WhatsApp will arrive on Bharat 1 in a month’s time.\nThat alone, in our opinion, will give the Bharat 1 a huge advantage over the JioPhone.\nA look at the interface on the Micromax Bharat 1. (HT Photo)\n While Reliance JioPhone has its own merits, Bharat 1 does bring something more substantial to the table. \nFor instance, the Bharat 1 has a mobile hotspot feature, which means you can use the phone to create a WiFi network. Also, the Bharat 1 is a dual-SIM phone and is not locked to any carrier. If you don’t want the BSNL offer, you can still use the phone with the operator of your choice.\nSpeaking of the BSNL offer, Micromax’s association with the state-run telecom operator was a strange choice. The operator isn’t really a popular choice in metro cities. According to subscription data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) as on July 31, Airtel had the highest wireless subscribers with 23.7% market share. Airtel is followed by Vodafone, Idea and Reliance Jio with 17.74%, 16.34% and 10.83% share respectively. BSNL is a distant fifth with 8.81% market share.\nBut what works in BSNL’s favour is its reach in rural and remote areas of the country. Besides an affordable data plan, the telco is also offering free access to its 10,000 Wi-Fi spots across the country.\nOn its website, BSNL boasts of big numbers to showcase its massive network capabilities that reach “646 districts, 4,519 cities/towns and 6.25 lakhs villages”.\nSumming up, Micromax’s Bharat 1 seems like a worthy rival to Reliance JioPhone as it offers competitive features, price point and bundled data benefits. Extras like mobile hotspot capability and dual-SIM support certainly gives it an edge.\nLooking beyond the competition, phones like JioPhone, Bharat 1 and even Airtel Karbonn A40 help pave way for achieving a larger objective – bridging the digital divide in India.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "7b9e99c6_in", "news_id": "f80715f6fd835f23cb3a392de548ea86_in", "title": "Micromax Bharat 1 first impressions: A worthy competitor to Reliance JioPhone", "ts": 1508348863, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/tech/micromax-bharat-1-first-impressions-a-worthy-competitor-to-reliance-jiophone/story-oqKEBAnW6dWUjHHQtskHMI.html"}

It’s been a pleasure playing against you again today.”\nPlaying under a closed roof at the Qi Zhong Tennis Center, Federer sprinted out of the blocks, breaking Nadal in the opening game and the Spaniard had little answer to the sheer variety of shots coming across the net.\nThe Swiss refused to take his foot off the pedal in the second set, breaking Nadal to go 3-2 up and keeping his cool to wrap up victory.\nHe sealed the win on his opponent’s serve, winning the second of three match points to claim his 94th career title.\nFederer, who won the tournament in 2014, has enjoyed himself on the fast courts of Shanghai this year, while Nadal will look back on a successful stint in Asia after winning last week’s China Open.\n“I want to congratulate Roger and his team for a great year. Today I think you played a fantastic match, so many congratulations,” Nadal said.\n“This year has probably been the most successful of my career here in China… It’s been a great two weeks and I feel very happy after a long year to be able to have the results here.

ff57ca57_in	{"content": " NEW DELHI: There may be noise over heavy tax burden on small businesses but initial data does not support the complaint. It turns out that over 40 per cent of the 54 lakh businesses which filed GST returns in July claimed 'nil' tax liability and paid no tax.This means that around 22 lakh did not pay even one rupee GST. \n Of the remaining 60 per cent or 32 lakh businesses that filed returns on the GST Network (GSTN), the IT backbone for the indirect tax, many did not have a cash liability as they opted to use the credits available for service tax or excise that they had paid before GST kicked in on July 1. \n  Data available with the government showed that apart from those with \"nil\" returns, close to 70 per cent of the 32 lakh businesses which had a tax liability paid anywhere between Re 1 and Rs 33,000 in taxes. In contrast, just around 0.3 per cent, which is a little over 10,000 companies accounted for almost two-thirds of the GST mopped up by the government in July. The government had said that it had mopped up around Rs 94,000 crore during July. \n Currently close to 1 crore businesses and service providers are registered with GSTN, of which 72 lakh had migrated from excise, VAT and service tax, while 25-26 lakh new taxpayers have been added, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday. He also said that around 94 - 95 per cent of the collection is from large assessees or those with a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore, who make up around 10 per cent of the registered base of taxpayers. \n \"Everyone is simply seeking exemptions but most are not paying taxes,\" said an official. The government's move to usher in GST has faced criticism with political parties blaming poor implementation for the problems being faced by businesses. The government, while fixing the problems has said that a part of the reason for the criticism is due to the fact that many entities which were earlier out of the net or evading taxes are now being forced to pay up. \n Although tax collections are lower from a majority of the taxpayers, the government is hoping that GST will help widen the base and create space in the future to reduce tax rate. Jaitley said at Friday's meeting that GST Council also decided on how rates will be tweaked in the future. \" As revenue increases, and depending on the revenue neutrality situation in the future, rates will be tailored according to the concept paper (that was cleared),\" he said. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "ff57ca57_in", "news_id": "8bc989c0e3a9e3579f9e3bb4ece1417e_in", "title": "Over 40% business entities make zero GST payment", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/over-40-business-entities-make-zero-gst-payment/articleshow/60978897.cms"}

It runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and is powered by a 1.3Ghz processor coupled with 1GB of RAM.\nIn a bid to compete with Reliance Jio’s, rival Bharti Airtel on Wednesday announced the launch of a new smartphone in partnership with Karbonn Mobiles. Called the Karbonn A40, the smartphone is available for an “effective price” of Rs 1,399. The market price of the phone is Rs 3,499.\nFine prints\nJust like the JioPhone, a customer needs to make a down payment of Rs 2,899 for the 4G smartphone. The customer needs to make monthly recharges of Rs 169 for continuous 36 months. \nThe customer will get a cash refund of Rs 500 after 18 months and another Rs 1000 after 36 months, taking the total cash benefit to Rs 1500.\n“In case the customer does not wish to opt for the Rs 169 bundled plan, she/he has the flexibility of doing recharges of any denomination and validity as per individual requirements. However, to claim the cash refund benefit, recharges worth Rs 3000 must be done within the first 18 months (to claim the first refund installment of Rs 500) and another Rs 3000 over the next 18 months (to claim the second refund installment of Rs 1000)”, said the company in a release. \nNote that the customer doesn’t need to return the device to Airtel or Karbonn at any point to claim the cash benefit. \n After sales support for the devices will be provided by the handset manufacturers through their service network, said the company.  \nKarbonn A40: Specifications, features\nThe smartphone comes with a 4-inch display. It runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and is powered by a 1.3Ghz processor coupled with 1GB of RAM.\nThe Karbonn A40 sports a 2-megapixel rear camera and 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. Other key features of the smartphone include 4G, VoLTE, Bluetooth and GPS. \nHow’s it different from the Reliance JioPhone\nThe Reliance JioPhone is essentially a smartphone in a feature phone form factor. The JioPhone is locked to Reliance’s ecosystem, which means you rely on Jio apps such as JioTV and JioVoice and so on. Also, you miss out on key apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Since the Karbonn A40 is an Android phone, you get access to all the popular apps including Google’s suite of apps such as Gmail, Google Maps, and so on. \n More low-cost 4G VoLTE smartphones coming soon  Airtel says that it will be partnering with multiple mobile handset manufacturers to launch more affordable 4G phones at low prices, and match the price of a feature phone.  \n“The partnership between Airtel and Karbonn is part of Airtel’s ‘Mera Pehla 4G Smartphone’ initiative, which is aimed at enabling every Indian to buy a 4G smartphone and get on to the digital superhighway,” the company added. \nState-run telecom operator BSNL earlier this week revealed plans to partner with handset companies to launch affordable phones bundled with data benefits from the telco.\n", "domain": "m.hindustantimes.com", "entry_id": "eff03fa8_in", "news_id": "5cb053e1ed817b122b8236a834c94650_in", "title": "Airtel takes on Reliance JioPhone with Karbonn A40, ultra low-cost 4G smartphone", "ts": 1507726153, "url": "http://m.hindustantimes.com/tech/airtel-takes-on-reliance-jiophone-with-karbonn-a40-priced-at-rs-1-399/story-k5H9KKTuq1COEVqkxqdjAK.html"}

7a54ddc9_in	{"content": " LONDON: Meat consumption is devastating some of the world's most valuable and vulnerable regions, due to the vast amount of land needed to produce animal feed, a report has warned. \n The growing popularity of a Western diet, which contains high levels of meat and dairy, means an area 1.5 times the size of the European Union would be saved if global consumption of animal products was reduced to just meeting nutritional requirements, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \n  According to the new report, 'Appetite for Destruction', launched at the Extinction and Livestock Conference, the consumption of animal products is leading to a vast and increasing amount of land being used for crops. This is threatening areas including the Amazon, the Congo Basin and the Himalayas, where water and land resources are already under significant pressure, the report warned. \n Excessive animal product consumption is responsible for 60% of all biodiversity loss, according to the WWF, with the UK food industry alone directly linked to the extinction of an estimated 33 species. \"The world is consuming more animal protein than it needs and this is having a devastating effect on wildlife,\" Duncan Williamson, WWF food policy manager said in a statement. \n \"A staggering 60% of global biodiversity loss is down to the food we eat. We know a lot of people are aware that a meat-based diet has an impact on water and land, as well as causing greenhouse gas emissions, but few know the biggest issue of all comes from the crop-based feed the animals eat,\" he added. \n Soy is produced in such large quantities that in 2010, the British livestock industry needed an area the size of Yorkshire (approx. just less than 10 times Delhi's) to produce soy used for animal feed, the report said.

These range from applying for a PAN or Permanent Account Number to filing income tax returns (ITRs) to using a mobile phone connection. All mobile phone numbers or SIMs not linked with Aadhaar will be deactivated after February 2018, according to a report by news agency Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) citing informed sources. The government is moving ahead with linking Aadhaar with mobile SIM cards, the agency added. Many telecom companies have asked their customers to finish the process of linking Aadhaar card with mobile number citing government directive. Aadhaar number or Unique Identity Number or UID, which is printed on the Aadhaar card, is also to be shared with financial institutions and has to be submitted to avail the various social security schemes.\nAadhaar is based on biometrics-based data. Aadhaar number is a 12-digit unique identity number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). Be it linking of Aadhaar with PAN, mobile SIM cards or bank accounts, there are different deadlines specified in each case.\nHere are four important deadlines to remember for you to link your Aadhaar with the various documents or products:\n1. Deadline for linking Aadhaar with PAN - December 31, 2017\nIn August, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) extended the last date for linking of Aadhaar with PAN \"to facilitate ease of compliance by the taxpayers\". The new deadline is December 31, 2017. Earlier, this deadline was August 31, 2017. Linking Aadhaar-PAN is mandatory for processing of income tax returns (ITRs) for assessment year 2017-18, the income tax department has said.\n\"If this linking (PAN-Aadhaar) is skipped, the return could be considered invalid and the person may have to file it again which shall be considered belated and may attract penalty, interest and other consequences like disallowances for losses,\" says Sandeep Sehgal, director of tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.\n(Also read: How to link PAN card with Aadhaar card)\n2. Deadline for linking Aadhaar with mobile number (SIM) - February 2018\n All mobile phone numbers not linked with Aadhaar will be deactivated after February 2018, according to a report by news agency Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) citing sources. That means mobile phone service users will have to link their  Aadhaar numbers with SIM cards . Many telecom companies have now started sending alerts to customers about completing the Aadhaar-Mobile number linking process.

Deadline for submitting Aadhaar details to banks/financial institutions - December 31, 2017\nThe government has made it mandatory for all banks and financial institutions to mention the Aadhaar details of clients in the KYC (Know your Customer) document.

Tewari said India had a great relationship with Japan and that relationship, its foundations and consolidation had been laid during the UPA regime.\nJapanese Prime Minister Abe arrived here Wednesday on a two-day visit with a packed agenda that includes the laying of the foundation stone for India’s first bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.\nTewari also criticised the government over the handling of the Rohingyas issue and said the criticism India had been subjected to by the United Nations Human Rights Council was “absolutely unprecedented”.\n“The stand which this government has taken on the Rohingyas is totally contrary to India’s traditions where we have welcomed the persecuted from any part of our neighbourhood,” he said. He said India had not faced “this kind of ignominy”.\n“So, therefore, you can be critical of (Congress vice president) Rahul Gandhi, but I think the time has come for the NDA-BJP Government and the Prime Minister to introspect that mere speeches and road shows with leaders of other countries do not substitute for diplomacy,” Tewari said. On Gandhi’s recent remarks in the US about being ready to take over as the party chief, he said the Congress was a democratic party and an organisational election process was on.\n“You don’t second guess an organisational election process. It will culminate logically in what the aspirations and the desires of the Congress workers are,” he said.\n", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "entry_id": "2b76995f_in", "news_id": "8f1dfa1966e5de3b6483a35b69dd7276_in", "title": "Congress wonders why Japanese PM Shinzo Abe being hosted in Gujarat and not Delhi", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/congress-wonders-why-japanese-pm-shinzo-abe-being-hosted-in-gujarat-and-not-delhi-4842480/"}
d951ecb0_in	{"content": " The new Delhi -Mumbai Rajdhani will not only decrease travel time by two hours, but will cost passengers Rs 600-800 less than the two other Rajdhanis already on the route. \nNew Delhi: Commuters on the Delhi -Mumbai route have another reason to rejoice this Diwali as Railways is introducing a new faster and cheaper Rajdhani. The special train will not only decrease travel time by two hours, but will cost passengers Rs 600-800 less than the two other Rajdhanis already on the route.\n The train will run from the Hazrat Nizamuddin station in Delhi to the Bandra Terminus in Mumbai and will be introduced to the sector on October 16. \n\"The special Rajdhani will initially run for three months -- from October 16 to January 16 -- for three days a week. The idea was to reduce the travel time by two hours with the current infrastructure and rolling stock. The trials have been successful,\" said Mohammad Jamshed, Member of the Railway Board. \n Presently, the route is served by the August Kranti Rajdhani and the Mumbai Central-New Delhi Rajdhani.\n While the August Kranti Rajdhani takes around 17 hours to traverse the distance between the national capital, the Mumbai Central-Delhi Rajdhani covers it in just under 16 hours. Neither halts at Bandra.\n The new train will take just under 14 hours to run between the two cities and will have three stops -- Kota, Vadodara and Surat.\n Mr Jamshed said the train will be beneficial for travellers as it will reach the respective destinations at around 6:00 am, giving them more time to spend in the city as well as helping them avoid suburban peak hour traffic.\n The train will chug-off from Delhi on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays and from Bandra on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.\n \"Flexi fare shall not be levied on bookings on this train. The fare of the train, however, will be 20 per cent more than the base fare of the existing Rajdhanis on the route. The concession is between Rs 600-Rs 835,\" Mr Jamshed said.\n As compared to the maximum flexi fare for the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani for second AC of Rs 4,105, this train will cost Rs 3,270. Similarly, as compared to the third AC flexi fare of Rs 2,925, this train will cost Rs 2,325.\n The catering services will be optional resulting in further reduction in prices if the passenger chooses to opt out.\n The special train will comprise one first AC, two 2AC and twelve 3AC coaches besides a pantry car and two power cars.\n The train will be hauled by two electric locomotives for better acceleration, deceleration and higher speed. It will run at a maximum speed of 130 kmph.\n The Delhi-Mumbai line is important for the railways as the route, once frequented mostly by business travellers, has been losing passengers to airlines. The route is also one of the two to be developed into special corridors with semi-high-speed services.\n", "domain": "ndtv.com", "entry_id": "d951ecb0_in", "news_id": "42e5030cc9d00b7d1b79ccde9be0af10_in", "title": "Railways' Diwali Gift To Commuters: Cheaper, Faster Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani", "ts": 1507954726, "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/railways-diwali-gift-to-commuters-a-cheaper-faster-rajdhani-between-delhi-mumbai-1762628?fb"}

6eeb9731_in	{"content": "Picture Courtesy: olm013 on Reddit\nIt's almost final. Apple will launch a special edition phone, along with the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus on Tuesday at an event in the company's new headquarters in Cupertino, California. While the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus are going to be the successors of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, the special edition iPhone is going to be a tribute to the iPhone's success all these years as it marks the 10th anniversary. This special edition phone is also going to be named the iPhone X. It's not official but considering the name appears in the iOS 11 GM, which is the final version of the iOS 11, it is almost confirmed.\nThere are a lot of new technologies, at least from Apple's perspective, that we are going to see in the iPhone X (it was earlier known as the iPhone 8). While the phone will be revealed tomorrow, a lot is already known. Here are the 10 features that we expect to see in the iPhone X.\nOh, but before we discuss the iPhone X features, a few words about its price. The phone is likely to come in three variants -- read internal storage options -- and each of them will have different price (obviously). The starting price of the iPhone X is expected to be $999 while the top variant will cost $1199. In other words, in India expect the iPhone X to be priced around Rs 1 lakh when it comes -- hopefully -- just ahead of Diwali on October 19.\nOn to the features now, given that we have already talked much about the name and the price of the iPhone X.\nThe top feature of the iPhone X is going to be its screen. With display resolution of 1125 x 2436 pixels, the iPhone X screen is going to be the sharpest screen ever put in an iPhone. The iPhone 8 Plus, meanwhile, most likely limited to 1080P display.\nNot just the resolution, the iPhone X screen also comes packed with new features. It will use OLED panel, that shows punchier colours, will have the True Tone colour featured that was earlier seen in the iPad and is meant to show more accurate colours and will be bigger in size, probably 5.7 inches or more.\nThe iPhone X will come with Face ID, a new feature that will use 3D face-scanning technology to unlock the phone.\nThe iPhone X is expected to have 3GB RAM. It will come in three variants as far as internal storage is concerned. It will start from 64GB. Then there will be 256GB variant and finally the 512GB variant.\nThe iPhone X will be powered by the A11 processor, that is likely to come with six cores. Of course, this won't be the first Apple processor to have six cores. earlier we saw the A10X processor that used six cores but then those were the cores used in the iPad. The iPhone X will be the first iPhone with a six-core processor. The Apple A processor are very fast so expect the A11 to be fast as well.\nThe iPhone X will come with dual-camera setup on the back. One of these cameras is will use a telephoto lens (56mm) similar to what we got in the iPhone 7 Plus.\nThe iPhone X will not have the physical home button. Instead of that, it will have an edge-to-edge screen, similar to what you get with a phone like LG V30. For now, it is not clear where the Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) that was inside the Home button is going. Chances are that either it is moving to the back cover, or is going away.\nThe iPhone X will be powered by the iOS 11. The interesting part is that it may come with similar sort of the iOS 11 software dock that is inside the iPad Pro. In other words, even if the phone gets rid of the Home button, it will come with several on-screen software features that will allow users access to easy multitasking and access to apps.\nThe iPhone X will have an all-glass and metal design. The iPhone X will use a glass back cover, which will also allow Apple to support wireless charging in the phone, similar to what Samsung puts in its phones.\nThe iPhone X will support IP68 water and dust-proof design. In this way, the iPhone X will be a step up from the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, which too have waterproof and dustproof design but compatible with IP67 rating.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "6eeb9731_in", "news_id": "e4c9e5bc47b6778c4805f30ac07b88cd_in", "title": "iPhone X: 10 top features and expected price of Apple's special edition phone", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/iphone-x-10-top-features-and-expected-price-of-apples-special-edition-phone-launch-tomorrow/1/1045370.html?utm_source=chromenotification"}

They also want the inclusion of diesel in the new indirect tax's ambit.\nThe All India Motor Transport Congress claims there is confusion over various policies imposed on the transport sector/Representative Image\nNew Delhi: Over 90 lakh truckers will participate in a two-day nation-wide Chakka Jam from Monday to protest issues ranging from “disruptive” impact of the Goods and Services Tax to the “extortion” at RTO barriers in states.\n The decision to protest was taken as last minute negotiations with the government did not materialise, Harish Sabharwal, Additional Vice President (North) of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), told News18.com.\n \"We are going on a nationwide Chakka Jam today and tomorrow. Negotiations with the government did not yield any results as they did not agree to our demands. The truckers will suffer a loss of Rs 2,000 crore. We are compelled to suffer this loss,\" said Sabharwal, who is also a member in the Road Safety Council of the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways.\n Sabharwal said small-time truck drivers have been making \"frantic calls to the association since morning.\"\n \"Our means of protest is to stop our own vehicles and suffer losses. Small truck drivers and people associated with the job cycle have also been rattled, but we will soon go an indefinite strike if the government turns a blind eye to our demands,\" an AIMTC member told News18.com.\n Their protest primarily is against the disruptive policies under Goods and Services Tax (GST). They also want the inclusion of diesel in the new indirect tax's ambit.\n The AIMTC claims there is confusion over various policies imposed on the transport sector. Dealers have claimed that they are forced to do “coercive registration and unnecessary compliance” due to GST in taxes where they were earlier exempted.\n The AIMTC says the proposed E-Way Bill does not factor in all road transport issues and must be amended.\n Sabharwal had earlier told News18.com that after the implementation of the GST, most states have not removed the RTO barrier as expected, resulting in “extortion”, which has in turn caused a \"loss of over Rs 80,000 crore” in bribes.\n \"Truckers are bearing a loss of Rs 80,000 crore as bribes to various RTO barriers which have not ceased post GST. Only four states out of 22 have agreed to remove RTO barriers. GST has been an utter failure where the government is itself confused about the tax regime. We have been bombarded with three different tax slabs,\" said Sabharwal.\n The truckers have also demanded that since diesel, along with toll, accounts for more than 70% of the cost of operations for a trucker, \"diesel prices must be slashed and be brought under GST to create a uniformity in pricing”.\n One of the other key demands of AIMTC is that a special investigation team having their representation at the state level be constituted to probe into and address issues of corruption with ITOs, CTOs, RTOs.\n The AIMTC has sought that \"challans must be prohibited\" if there is no electronically verifiable proof by the official concerned to validate whether he or she actually belongs to the Road Transport Office.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "71b36264_in", "news_id": "e1760b6d81baf0118fcc4abc53797669_in", "title": "90 Lakh Truckers Begin India-wide Chakka Jam Against GST", "ts": 1507530376, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/90-lakh-truckers-begin-all-india-chakka-jam-against-gst-to-lose-rs-2000-cr-1540205.html"}

The two-judge bench said that sexual intercourse with a wife between 15 and 18 will amount to rape.\n The SC relied on the Child Marriage Prohibition Act too to reach this conclusion. The court said that immunity cannot be granted to a husband who is having sexual intercourse with his wife in this age group.\n This verdict will not have a retrospective effect.\n A petition by NGO Independent Thought had challenged the exception clause (2) under Section 375 IPC (which deals with rape) that says intercourse or sexual act by a man with his wife, not below 15 years, is not rape. This created a dichotomy as the age of consent was 18 years, it was contended.\n The petitioners had contended that it is against the interest of the girl child as well. The court on Wednesday said that there can be no legal protection be given under Section 375 (2) of the IPC.\n The petitioners prayed that the clause be struck down as it is “violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution”.\n While hearing the plea, the court had asked the Centre how Parliament could create such an exception in the law. The apex court, however, clarified that it did not want to go into the aspect of marital rape, but asked why such an exception was created when the age of consent was 18 years for “all purposes”.\n The Centre replied that doing away with this exception would open up the domain of marital rape, which does not exist in India. The Centre’s counsel had referred to the concept of age of puberty among Muslims for the purpose of marriage and said these aspects have been deliberated upon by Parliament before arriving at a conclusion.\n The petitioners also contended that the exception clause went against the objectives of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and was also in violation of international conventions to which India was a signatory.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "ff1c76d6_in", "news_id": "2ce1ee099a1c045540cd017e3102aa18_in", "title": "Age of Consent 18, Sex With Minor Wife is Rape: Supreme Court", "ts": 1507707201, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/sex-with-minor-wife-is-rape-says-supreme-court-1542751.html"}

On Monday, Som said the ivory-white marble mausoleum was a blot on Indian culture. Adityanath though will visit Agra and the Taj Mahal on October 25 and said on Tuesday that what matters is that Indian workers worked hard to build it. \"It does not matter who built it and for what reason. It was built by the blood and sweat of Indian labourers,\" he said.\nWhile Som has been getting brickbats for his comments, the UP government and BJP too have been targeted by some like All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi. \"Comments like these from a leader of BJP cannot be his personal opinion and is a reflection of the party itself,\" he said.\nThis is hardly the first controversy for the UP government related to the Taj Mahal.

Zakir Musa\nSrinagar, September 23: Terrorist Zakir Musa has warned that he will not rest until he liberates “occupied Hindustan.” He also cited a 8th century example of a Muslim general killing a Hindu king in Sindh to establish Shariah rule. He exhorted the Muslims to join the battle to establish Islamic Caliphate again.\nHe issued the statement through official media of Kashmir-based Al Qaeda group, Ghazwat-ul-Hind. He said in a statement that Umayyad caliphate’s army general Muhammad bin Qasim had implemented Al-Sindh 1,400 years ago. The caravan started then will not stop until it “liberated Hindustan’.\nZakir Musa is the most wanted terrorist operating in Kashmir. He was once reported to have fallen in security forces’ trap, but he managed to escape. He was the commander of Hizbul Muzahideen, but he had to quit after he threatened to behead Hurriyat Conference leaders. Unlike other terrorist, Musa despises political ‘freedom’ and openly bats for the establishment of Islamic Caliphate.\nOn the eve of Bakr-Eid, Zakir Musa had issued a 10-minute audio message, threatening to “liberate” India from “cow-worshiping” PM and Hindus. He had warned the government against deporting Rohingya Muslims. He had also targetted Pakistan for shutting down terror training camps, and putting mujahideen in jails.\nZakir Musa hails from a wealthy Kashmiri family. Most of his brothers and cousins are doctors. He himself was an engineering student in Chandigarh before becoming turning to terrorism.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "df8bbe29_in", "news_id": "99c918edf13ca435af40b0bfd65f744b_in", "title": "Terrorist Zakir Musa Vows to Liberate 'Occupied India'", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://www.india.com/news/india/kashmir-terrorist-zakir-musa-vows-to-free-liberate-occupied-india-asks-muslims-to-shun-comfort-and-join-battle-to-establish-caliphate-2491745/"}

Going by the several media reports, Reliance has managed to book about 6 million JioPhones. The booking of the JioPhone aka India ka smartphone started sometime around the end of August, however, few days later the company paused the pre-booking process, the reason being the heavy demand that JioPhone reportedly got. According to a PTI report, as claimed by sources close to Jio, the company is expected to resume the pre-booking process of the JioPhone post-Diwali.\nGoing by the report, the company's key focus right now is to deliver the 6 million JioPhone (estimated numbers) that have been booked so far. JioPhone delivery started around Navratri, as promised by the company and is expected to give away all the booked JioPhones by Diwali.\nSoon after all the JioPhones are delivered, the second round of pre-booking is said to start. The estimated time for the second round of pre-booking for JioPhone is set to start after Diwali. This means that Jio is preparing to start the JioPhone pre-booking by the end of October.\n\"The second phase of JioPhone booking will start after Diwali. Likely from October-end or November first week,\" a Reliance Retail channel partner told PTI. However, Reliance Jio is yet to roll out an official statement on the same. \nSome of them have already received their JioPhone. While other are expected to receive it by Diwali as stated by several media reports.\nTo check you JioPhone delivery status you can simply visit the official website - Jio.com and track your order by entering your order number that you must have received while booking the JioPhone. The customers can also head on to the MyJio app using their registered number and enter order number to track their JioPhone order. They can also simply call 18008908900, provide their order number and know the delivery status of their JioPhone.\nJioPhone was booked with Rs 500. At the time of delivery, the customer needs to pay Rs 1,000. They also need to produce some documents like - JioPhone order number, the receipt that they must have received while booking the phone, and their Aadhaar details.\nTo recall, Mukesh Ambani launched the JioPhone at the RIL AGM meet at an effective price of Rs zero. This means that the customers need to pay a sum of Rs 1500 (Rs 500 while booking, Rs 1000 during the delivery), but the money will be refunded back. But, under a certain condition. The customers need to use and refund the JioPhone within 36 months from its delivery date.\nHow to book JioPhone after the second round of pre-booking resumes post diwali? JioPhone can be pre-booked from both online and offline channels. To book the phone online, the interested customers need to head on to either MyJio app or the company website - Jio.com. For offline booking, the interested customers can visit the nearest Reliance Digital stores or other retail partners.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "b9697305_in", "news_id": "20b97edd538ef2fa9ac25277fcd5e485_in", "title": "JioPhone pre-booking to resume after Diwali: Report", "ts": 1508129666, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/jiophone-pre-booking-to-resume-after-diwali-report/1/1069455.html"}

Mail Today has learnt from senior diplomats who attended the meet that Pakistan raised the issue of hosting of the SAARC Summit. \nThe diplomat said, \"Pakistan made the point that they would want to host the SAARC summit soon.\" But, another diplomat shared with the newspaper that one of the representatives commented, \"the atmosphere right now was not conducive\" to hold the summit. Everybody in the room concurred. \nThe fact that there was general consensus on not having Pakistan host the summit unless the situation improves, shows that all the South Asian member nations continue to show solidarity with India and her concerns.\nMail Today spoke to diplomats and representatives of various member nations who attended the meeting to get a sense of what transpired. One of the senior officials when asked on if terrorism emanating from Pakistan was raised at the forum said, \"everybody, including Pakistan, Afghanistan and India spoke on terrorism but nobody really pointed at each other on the issue. Everybody presented their case and while views on terrorism differed there was no finger pointing\". \nThe External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj attended the meeting, delivered her speech and left. She did not stay for lunch. The rest of the session was conducted by Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar. There was no exchange of words or hand shake between the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers. A diplomat expressed relief that despite the tensions all sides maintained quorum and nobody came to blows. \"The atmosphere was cold but there was no open confrontation,\" he said. Adding that the Indian and Pakistan side did not see this as an opportunity to move forward. \"While there was no opportunity to shake hands, neither walked up to the other to say hello\", he said.\nIndia had made its position amply clear on the SAARC Summit level meeting to be held in Pakistan. Last year, the SAARC Summit was cancelled unanimously by all the member nations after India initiated the process of boycott because of the terrible terror attacks from Pakistan for which there has been no real action taken by Islamabad. An officer involved in the SAARC process also said that there has been no real forward movement on many projects that India has advanced. \"There has been no headway on those SAARC projects with Pakistan\", he said.\nWhenever SAARC summit level meeting happens, as per procedure, it will be held in Pakistan but as a diplomat said, \"the decision to hold the summit in Pakistan remains but date on when to hold it is yet to be determined\". For now, Pakistan's proposal to hold the summit in the near future seems highly unlikely unless Pakistan makes a drastic shift in its \"terror policy\" and dismantles the terror infrastructure that exists in its soil.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "3436dffc_in", "news_id": "91e3ed6dfec02d9eecdd5333f909113a_in", "title": "SAARC sides with India: No one wants Pakistan as host", "ts": 1506395686, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/saarc-pakistan-host-india-denies/1/1054254.html"}

(Getty image)\nNew Delhi: India, who are high on confidence after producing stupendous performances in the recent times, are all set to face arch-foes Pakistan and the in-form Men in Blue would aim to continue their unbeaten run in their third and final Super 4 match of the 10th men’s Asia Cup, tomorrow.\nConsidering their recent form and domination, India, the top-ranked side in the tournament, will start as overwhelming favourites against the world ranked 13 Pakistan, a nation with a glorious hockey history but currently struggling to get themselves back on the world map.\nIn the recent past, India have completely dominated over Pakistan, and the Manpreet Singh-led side would look to continue their stranglehold over the neighbouring country.\nBarring the 1-1 draw against Korea in their first Super 4 match, India have been in red-hot form in the tournament, having scored some beautiful field goals and displaying what they are best known for, one-touch attacking hockey.\nThe match against Korea seemed to have come as a wake-up call for the Indians, who are playing their maiden tournament under the new chief coach Sjoerd Marijne.\nThe draw against Korea acted as the right catalyst for India as they came out all guns blazing against the ever- impressive Malaysia and routed them 6-2 in their second Super 4 match yesterday.\nIndia are atop the table in Super 4 stage with four points from a win and a draw, followed by Malaysia (3 points), Korea (2 points) and Pakistan (1) from two games each.\nAnd come tomorrow, a draw would be enough for India to seal their place in the Sunday’s summit clash as they enjoy a better goal difference than any other side.\nBut it would be easier said than done as there is nothing to lose for the Pakistanis, who would be keen to prove a point to the world that they should not be considered pushovers.\nHowever, the situation is far from rosy for Pakistan as they not only would have to beat India by a big margin to stand in with a chance to qualify for the final but their fate will also depend on result of the other Super 4 match.\nWith one foot in the final, the Indians though cannot afford to take Pakistan lightly as they very well know that irrespective of current form, the result of any India-Pakistan hockey encounter depends on how well the teams handle pressure and emotions on the turf.\nBut all said and done, the Indians are expected to come out with flying colours and any result apart from that would be a dampener for Majirne’s boys, who have displayed outstanding hockey so far in the tournament.\nWhat has been the hallmark and most eye-catching thing for India in the tournament is the performance of their forward line.\nThe Indian strikers comprising Akashdeep Singh, Ramandeep Singh, SV Sunil, Lalit Upadhyay and young Gujrat Singh have been terrific upfront scoring fantastic field goals.\nThe Indian midfield have been held well by skipper Manpreet Singh and Chinglensana Singh, while veteran Sardar Singh has done exceedingly well as the central defender and the linkman between the midfield and the forwards.\nMeanwhile, in the other Super 4 game of the day, Korea will face Malaysia.

After scoring valuable 79 runs, the former India captain was effective behind the stumps as well, inflicting a stumping besides taking two catches. However, his role these days is not limited to that only.\nDhoni, like always, keeps providing his inputs to the bowlers and also make changes in the field, quietly taking over from Virat Kohli without anybody noticing. \nIndia vs Australia 2017: Virat Kohli Has Shown Lot of Faith in MS Dhoni, Says Sourav Ganguly Read more\nOn Sunday, India had Australia on the ropes when Glenn Maxwell’s hitting infused some life into the Australian run-chase. At four down for just 35 runs, Maxwell came in and clubbed Kuldeep Yadav for 22 runs in an over, before being dismissed for 39 off just 18 balls.\nBut while Maxwell was on an attacking spree, the stump mic captured Dhoni advising the spinners in Hindi. “Stump pe mat dal (don’t bowl in line of the stumps)” and “Arre baahar daal, isko itna aage nahi (bowl outside the off stump, not this full to him).”\nUnfortunately, Yadav couldn’t execute Dhoni’s ideas in that over and was taken apart. Then came on legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal to bowl from the other end. \nWoh maarane waala daal naa; andar yaa baahar koi bhi\nMSD had almost similar instructions for Chahal. But he too wasn’t spot on with his execution. “Tu bhi nahin sunta hai kya (do you also don’t listen?)” said Dhoni, adding “Aise, aise dalo (bowl it like this),” when the leggie spun one delivery away from the bat.\nChahal eventually dismissed Maxwell once he followed Dhoni’s advice. Maxwell, who was slogging across, was victim of the ball turning away from him as he hit it straight to Manish Pandey in the deep.\nKuldeep, during the post-match show on television, admitted how Dhoni provided valuable inputs from behind the stumps to help him get ride of the other danger-man David Warner.\nHow did Dhoni help Kuldeep stun #AUS?

The new coach has a detachable board that can be placed on top after joining the two side seats. The move is meant to take care that passengers do not suffer from a backache.\nThe modular bio-toilet has a wash-basin platform and a baby seat/diaper changing seat! The toilet module has been changed as per the ICF design to eliminate the problem of water logging.\nThe area outside the toilet has a modular wash basin with a big mirror.\nThe coach has LED lights with berth number stickers. It also boasts of GPS-based passenger information system.\nThe ladder that one takes to upper berths has been redesigned keeping in mind passengers' convenience.\nThe coaches boast of thermoplastic panels without visible screws for better safety and aesthetics. The berths have been ergonomically designed. The texture of rexene has also been changed to prevent dust ingress.\nThe Mahamana Express was initially conceptualised as a train that has been made by modifying seven types of coaches.

Irani had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Amethi against Rahul Gandhi. \nTHE TOP TEN DEVELOPMENTS SO FAR:\nParty sources said the visit of the senior BJP leaders was aimed at sending a clear message that the current dispensation believed in an all-round development and was not meting out \"step-motherly treatment\" to a Congress constituency.\nRahul Gandhi had, during his visit to Amethi on October 5, accused the BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh of re-inaugurating the projects launched by the previous UPA regime in the district and neglecting his constituency.\nThe visit of the BJP heavyweights is aimed at announcing various schemes and projects. Among other key events, Information and Broadcasting minister Irani will attend the launch of an FM station at Gauriganj and an initiative to save Gomti river near Pipri village.\nIrani will also attend the inauguration of a tuberculosis unit at the district hospital and a primary health centre at Odari Tiloi.\n Soon after her arrival at Chowdhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow on Monday, Irani drove in a cavalcade to Amethi. She made a stopover at Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of Congress President  Sonia Gandhi , where she interacted with party workers and visited the residence of local BJP legislator Dal Bahadur Kori. \nOn Monday, Irani had accused Rahul of \"insulting\" the people of Gujarat and claimed that the Congress will suffer what she called a \"historic defeat\" in the upcoming Assembly polls. Irani's attack on the Congress vice-president came after he mocked the BJP's development model in Gujarat at his public meetings in the poll-bound state.\nGandhi should devote time to Amethi, his Lok Sabha seat, as it needs more development works, she said, claiming that people of Amethi are asking for 'vikas' even as their MP goes around the nation mocking 'vikas'.\nAmethi has traditionally been a Congress bastion, but witnessed a high-pitched electoral battle between Rahul and Irani in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Though she lost, Irani managed to reduce the Congress leader's victory margin from around 3.70 lakh votes in 2009 to 1.07 lakh in 2014.\nIn the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, the BJP won six of the 10 Assembly seats falling under the Amethi and Rae Bareli parliamentary constituencies. Four of these were in Amethi.\n Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi is on a three-day trip to Gujarat, where he has consistently attacked Prime Minister  Narendra Modi 's Gujarat model. He has also invoked the recent controversy involving Amit Shah's son Jay and his financial dealings as exposed by The Wire news website. \n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "7ca5af1d_in", "news_id": "b5bbdcd00b667701f5292024f1257517_in", "title": "Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath, Smriti Irani in Rahul Gandhis Amethi today: 10 points", "ts": 1507614266, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amit-shah-yogi-adityanath-smriti-irani-rahul-gandhi-amethi-congress-bjp/1/1065242.html"}

All hell breaks loose! (Image: WhatsApp)\n WhatsApp has a beautiful Diwali gift to offer to users—Live location. Of course, it seems like a breakthrough helpful feature but we already know how the “WhatsApp Blue tick” story unfolded. Having said that live location sharing feature is nothing new per se. There is Telegram, iMessage, Snapchat and Google Maps offering the same limited time live location sharing option. But very few people actually use this feature. With WhatsApp embracing the same ‘Live location’ sharing, more people will start using it and we can already sense how this noble feature could cause distress among users. \n WATCH VIDEO: Apple iPhone 8 Plus Review | 3 Reasons To Buy & 2 To Skip It \nWhat is it? \n WhatsApp Live Location sharing allows you to share your location in real-time with family or friends. “Whether you're meeting up with friends, letting loved ones know you're safe, or sharing your commute, Live Location is a simple and secure way to let people know where you are,” explains WhatsApp. \n The feature will be rolled out to both Android and iPhone in the coming weeks. The WhatsApp Live Location sharing feature is not permanent and you will have the option to share your real-time location for 15 minutes, 1 hour or 8 hours with someone or a group. You can stop sharing your real time location any time you want. \nHow is it different from the existing location sharing on WhatsApp? \n On the existing WhatsApp location sharing feature, you have the flexibility to choose the location and share it. But with Live Location sharing, the exact location of the smartphone will be broadcasted as it is. And the same will be tracked and shared with the person or group. You will have no control on the Live location stream unless you decide to turn it off. In Snapchat, users are even shown as to whether they are driving or walking. \nHow does it work? \n Open a chat with the person or group you want to share with. Under \"Location\" in the attach button, there's a new option to \"Share Live Location.\" Choose for how long you want to share and tap send. Each person in the chat will be able to see your real-time location on a map. And if more than one person shares their Live Location in the group, all locations will be visible on the same map.\nHow can it be a problem for you? \n There is no privacy threat as such. This end-to-end encrypted feature lets you control who you share with and for how long. You can choose to stop sharing at any time or let the Live Location timer simply expire.\n But what happens when you are forced to switch on Live Location sharing by your loved ones? All hell breaks loose! Just imagine the situation when you are not keen on letting your family or friends your exact location but you are forced. Or, when you tell that your just 5 mins away from a party and your friends force your share your live location? We don’t want to drop more hints of taking advantage of live location but be informed beforehand to avoid the repeat of “blue tick” cold wars among friends. \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "559733ee_in", "news_id": "3d3f55fd17e51fd1376140ea08312a2b_in", "title": "WhatsApp Live Location: Say Hi to This New Feature to Sour Your Relationships", "ts": 1508396990, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/tech/whatsapp-live-location-say-hi-to-this-new-feature-to-sour-your-relationships-1550343.html"}

52794140_in	{"content": "The Supreme Court on Monday banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region with immediate effect, saying its September 12 order temporarily permitting sale of firecrackers would be effective from November 1. \nNew Delhi: Even as the Supreme Court, on Monday, ruled in favour of a ban on sale of firecrackers, it seemed to have left a small loophole in the entire process. While it may not be a raging trend, the apex court seems to have missed out on the online sale of crackers.\n Many firecracker companies, like Cock brand for example, have a legitimate website where one can order firecrackers online. The website mentions that the minimum order should be worth Rs 3,000. The Supreme Court had, keeping in mind the air pollution levels in Delhi especially post Diwali, ordered for a blanket ban on sale of firecrackers, not bursting them, effective from November 1.\n Websites like cockbrand.in, ayyanonline, buyonlinecrackers.com, crackersindia.com, and even e-bay are selling firecrackers of all sorts across the country. The apex court, however, is silent on that. “Say for example the firecracker business is based out of Bengaluru, and the order is made from Delhi, the seller can reject the order considering the area of purchase falls under the SC order. Likewise, if the firecracker brand is selling its products online from Delhi, it should ideally curb its practices because the SC has banned sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR,” said advocate Ashish Dixit.\n Another aspect that the order seems to be silent on is what happens to all those who bring in firecrackers from other states, say Uttar Pradesh or Haryana. Also, since there is no ban on bursting firecrackers, those who have already stocked up on the crackers would still be going ahead with the festivities, thus throwing into disarray the court’s observation based reducing air pollution.\n The Supreme Court on Monday banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region with immediate effect, saying its September 12 order temporarily permitting sale of firecrackers would be effective from November 1. \n A two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice AK Sikri said it wanted to test the effect of the ban on the national capital’s notoriously toxic air in view of the upcoming Diwali. \"We should see at least in one Diwali the impact of a cracker-free festivity,\" the bench said. Diwali is on October 19 and the order effectively means that no firecrackers will be available for purchase before the festival.\n The court had on September 12 temporarily lifted its order of November 11, 2016, suspending permanent licences for sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. \n During the hearing on the plea seeking restoration of last year's order, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had told the bench that they \"support\" the application. \n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "52794140_in", "news_id": "74ed99f19f5e20ce7fdbd3bf9a6f9085_in", "title": "Despite Supreme Court Ban Online Sale of Firecrackers on in Delhi, NCR", "ts": 1507616973, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/despite-supreme-court-ban-online-sale-of-firecrackers-on-in-delhi-ncr-1541759.html"}

We are awaiting a response from the Congress party since it has agred to our demands, Hardik Patel was quoted as saying by TV news channels.\nThe remarks from Hardik Patel, who had spearheaded the Patel quota agitation in Gujarat, came after it appeared that he had a 'secret' meeting with Rahul Gandhi at a hotel in Ahmedabad yesterday.\nThe rumoured Hardik Patel-Rahul Gandhi meeting had triggered intense speculations about the Congress warming up to the Patel community ahead of crucial assembly elections in Gujarat.\nGujarati TV news channels had on Monday claimed that Hardik Patel had reportedly met Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, for about 40 minutes at The Ummed Hotel in Ahmedabad on Monday.\nThe channels also aired video clips showing Hardik Patel entering and leaving the hotel where Rahul Gandhi was staying. \nNotably, the Gandhi scion was at The Ummed from Monday morning, while AICC member in-charge of Gujarat, Ashok Gehlot, held a series of meetings at the same hotel since late Sunday evening.\nThe speculation about Hardik's secret meeting with Rahul started doing the rounds after the Patel community leader claimed that he would not be able to meet the Gandhi scion on Monday morning as he would be at a public function in Mandal town. He reportedly showed up at the hotel around 4 pm yesterday and later went to Mandal around 7.30 pm to address a meeting there.\nWhile it was claimed that Hardik met Rahul at the hotel along with Nikhil Savani, the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) co-convener who had quit the BJP on Monday, Congress leader Gehlot categorically denied that any such meeting took place between the two.\nHardik Patel had denied meeting Rahul Gandhi and said that he instead met Ashok Gehlot and Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki to discuss the issues affecting the Patidar community, including OBC quota.\n\"Had I met Rahul, I would have met him in public, which would give me more mileage. Why should I meet Rahul secretly?\" he had told reporters.\nSolanki too corroborated the statement, saying, \"Hardik met me, Ashok Gehlot and other Congress leaders but not Rahul Gandhi. Though both were in the same hotel, they did not meet.\"\nLater, Gehlot, in a series of tweets, accused the Gujarat government of spying on Congress leaders. \nMeanwhile, reacting to the issue, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel today attacked Congress, saying that the Grand Old Party can do anything to form a government in the BJP-ruled state.\nCongress would even send invitation to terrorists like Hafiz Saeed if it feels they can help them form government in Gujarat, Patel was quoted as saying by ANI.\n", "domain": "zeenews.india.com", "entry_id": "25ff7d8c_in", "news_id": "962a956eabb945c43e6de795eb22c2ee_in", "title": "Want to defeat BJP in Gujarat, awaiting Congress' response: Hardik Patel", "ts": 1508840092, "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/gujarat/want-to-defeat-bjp-in-gujarat-awaiting-congress-response-hardik-patel-2051710.html"}

When the tsunami came, all the non-tribals went out to get the fish. Some of the tribals went to the non-tribals and told them not to go. And that's why, no tribals died,\" said the Congress vice-president.\n\"And as a liberal today, that's what I feel. Everyone knows that something has gone wrong. Right-wing politicians are telling people to go and pick up the fish... But you're not going to get simple answers,\" he said.\nFile image of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. PTI\n\"The idea of non-violence is under attack today, yet it is only idea which can take humanity forward,\" he added.\n\"The only response to a person having a bad idea is is love and compassion. Using violence against a person infected by a bad idea results in the idea spreading. This non-violent philosohphy has spread far beyond India. Non-violence is hard work. It is this idea that is viciously under attack today,\" Rahul said.\n\"When Rajiv Gandhi and Sam Pitroda spoke about bringing computers to India, a leader of the BJP who became prime minister of the nation said, 'What do we need computers for?',\" he pointed out.\nRahul then spoke about the significance of India's story of development.\n\"For everything anyone says about India, there is no democratic country in human history that has raised as many people out of poverty as India. We have done it peacefully together... It is imperative that India sustain a high growth rate for 10 to 15 years uninterrupted,\" said the Congress vice-president.\nOn economy and jobs\n\"No amount of growth is enough for India if it is not accompanied by creation of jobs. So, the central challenge for India is jobs. Roughly, 12 million people enter the job market every year... India does not have and nor does it want China's coercive instruments,\" he said.\nHe then said the Modi government was currently paying attention only to the top 100 companies in India.\nSmall & medium entrepreneurs are the bedrock of India's economic progress: Rahul Gandhi in #UCBerkeleypic.twitter.com/qZlYAjphiD\n— ANI (@ANI) September 12, 2017\n\"India needs to turn colossal number of small and medium businesses. Currently, attention is only being paid to the top 100 companies in India. Big businesses are protected by their deep pockets,\" he said.\n\"What India is trying to do is to connect its people with the global economy. If this process breaks down, it will shake the entire world,\" he said. \"Listening to India is very important. We have experts in every single field. Currently, we are not producing enough jobs. 30,000 new youngsters are joining the job market every day and yet, the government is creating just 500 jobs every day,\" said the Congress leader.\nOn intolerance\nThe Congress vice-president then attacked the government on various fronts.\n\"What can destroy our momentum is the opposite energy: Hatred, anger and politics of polarisation, which has raised its ugly head in India today,\" said Rahul.\n \"Muslims are being killed in India today, liberal journalists are being shot,\" he said, referring to the murder of activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh. \nOn demonetisation\nRahul then hit out at demonetisation.\n\"The government's economic policies like demonetisation and GST were applied hastily. Millions of jobs were wiped out after demonetisation. Farmers were hit very hard. Farmer suicides have skyrocketed throughout the country. Demonetisation, a completely self-inflicted wound, resulted in a loss of 2 percent in GDP,\" he said.\n\"Decisions like demonetisation were taken without asking Chief Economic Advisor and Parliament, which caused tremendous damage,\" ANI further quoted him as saying.\nOn Congress\nAfter he finished his speech, when asked about what the Congress was doing to solve its problems which could get it back into power, Rahul said, \"Any party which has been in power for 10 years will run into a problem. It is natural. The vision we had laid out in 2004 was for 10 years.\"\n\"Congress, unlike the BJP and RSS, is basically a conversation. Most of my work is sitting in a room and listening to people.\"\n\"If you look at most of the things BJP is doing, they are things we said. The central architecture is that they borrowed from us. But that architecture does not work now because we know it stopped working,\" he said.\n\"We need to make a smooth transition between senior people and younger people. You can't just brush aside senior people,\" he added.\n \"India has basically lost its vision... Modi has clamped down on RTI. The amount of information that was flowing around during our time was much more than the amount now,\" said the Congress vice-president. \nOn the 1984 anti-Sikh riots\nWhen questioned about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Rahul said that he was \"with them in their quest for justice\". \"I lost my father and my grandmother to violence.

They tell you I'm reluctant. They tell you I'm stupid. You've seen me now. You make up your mind. This operation is basically run by the gentleman running our country,\" he said. \n There is a BJP machine,about 1000 guys sitting on computers&telling you about me: Rahul Gandhi on question of being a reluctant politician pic.twitter.com/JzyJj6CU6c\n— ANI (@ANI) September 12, 2017\nOn being asked whether Rahul would become the Congress president soon, he said that he was ready to head Congress but decision was not his.\nOn India's political machinery\nHe said that the \"political machinery\" in India had now become weak. \"Our political machinery — the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha — they are not as empowered as they should be,\" he said.\n\"Laws in India are made by ministers and five or six people surrounding the ministers. To me, 546 people in Lok Sabha should be 546 institutions,\" he said. \"Today, our MPs don't make laws. They get worried about making roads in villages. That is the fundamental thing that has gone wrong in India... Taking India to the next level is ensuring our Parliament works.\"\nOn Jammu and Kashmir\nThe Congress vice-president also had a lot to say about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\"For nine years, I worked behind the scenes with (the then) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Mr Chidambaram, Mr Jairam Ramesh and a large number of people and we worked silently on Jammu and Kashmir. When we started in 2004, terrorism was rampant in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2013, I hugged the (then) prime minister and told him one of his biggest successes was the end of violence in Jammu and Kashmir,\" he said.\n\"We did that by holding panchayati raj elections. We did by linking women to banks... Our strategy was to close the space for terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir,\" he added.\n\"In 2014, the Indian government did something that inflicted a huge strategic cost in India,\" Rahul said.\n\"PDP was the instrument that brought Kashmiri youngsters into the political space. The day Mr Modi made an alliance between PDP and BJP, he destroyed PDP as an instrument for bringing youth into the political space,\" he said.\nSo he(PM Modi) massively opened up space for the terrorists in Kashmir, and you saw the increase in violence: Rahul Gandhi pic.twitter.com/mJCMrDy5eO\n— ANI (@ANI) September 12, 2017\n\"Today, the space in Jammu and Kashmir has been opened up not only for Pakistanis but for terrorists,\" Rahul said.\nRahul also implied that Modi had dictatorial tendencies. \"What I sense is he doesn't converse with people he works with.

It will continue on Thursday and on Friday at 12 noon, when the party workers will lay siege to Union Urban Development Ministry housed in New Delhi's Nirman Bhavan.\nOn Monday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had also called the fare hike a \"conspiracy\" to benefit cab aggregators.

(AP)\nNew Delhi: Rumours have been doing the rounds that India skipper Virat Kohli has asked the Indian selectors for rest after the second Test against Sri Lanka and for the succeeding ODI series. But Indian cricket fans can heave a sigh of relief as their favourite player will be available for all the three Test matches against the Lankans.\n Speaking to CricketNext after picking the squad for the T20I series against New Zealand and the first two Test against Sri Lanka, chief selector MSK Prasad refuted all rumours and said that Kohli had made himself available for selection for all the three Test matches and only after that would the selectors look at resting the captain. \n “There is no confusion and Kohli is available for all the three Test matches against Sri Lanka. We will look at resting him after that. He too deserves rest and the rotation policy will be applicable even for the skipper,” he said.\n Initial rumours of Kohli asking for a break was further fuelled after the selectors decided to name the squad for only the first two Test and then acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary made it clear that Ajinkya Rahane had been named deputy for the series against the Lankans. Deputies are named generally only when the team is picked for an overseas series. But when questioned, Amitabh refused to be dragged into speculating.\n “The team has been picked for the first two matches as of now and the decision was made to name Rahane the deputy. I do not see the reason to speculate whether Rahane has been named deputy because Kohli has made himself unavailable for the third Test,” he told CricketNext.\n With MSK Prasad making it clear that Kohli will play the Test series before a decision is taken on giving him a break, it is certain that the skipper is set to go for a break as the team plays Sri Lanka in three ODI matches before the tour of South Africa. And that could mean ODI deputy Rohit Sharma being handed the captaincy of the national team for the first time.\n But acting BCCI president CK Khanna said that the call would be taken at the right time by the concerned people. “It is too early to say anything. The decision will be made by the selectors led by MSK Prasad and the acting secretary,” he told CricketNext. \n Speaking to the media after picking the squads, Prasad also praised Shreyas Iyer for performing consistently across all formats.\n \"Shreyas Iyer has been prolific in all forms of the game, be it Tests, ODIs or T20s or IPL — name anything, he is performing. If we pick a player, we will give him an extended run and we will continue with him for some point and nurture him and see that he goes on to become successful,” he said.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "ee219a41_in", "news_id": "80d78cb98a318c9789f1c718660534c0_in", "title": "Virat Kohli is Available for All Three Tests Against Sri Lanka: MSK Prasad", "ts": 1508825065, "url": "http://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/virat-kohli-is-available-for-all-three-tests-against-sri-lanka-msk-prasad-1554991.html"}

The social media company has awarded $1000 bounty (over Rs 64,000) to Vijeta Pillai who found a bug in Facebook Workplace, a tool that the company has built specifically for business organisations.\nIncidentally, Vijeta is not a software engineers or programmer. She is a sales representative at a company called Cloud 11 and lives in Pune. However, while using Facebook Workplace she stumbled upon this serious bug in the tool that posed a big security risk to an organisation using it.\nThe Facebook Workplace is similar to regular Facebook. In other words it allows its users to share posts, comment on other posts and send messages to other users. But unlike Facebook, which is a service for everyone and their aunts, the Facebook Workplace is a tool that that is for organisations to use. In other words, it is local social media tool that an organisation can use, with built-in security features and options relevant to companies like Cloud 11.\nWhile using the tool, Vijeta found that there was some problem with the way permissions worked in the Facebook Workplace. In Facebook Workplace, admin could add an employee to the company account and give some access rights to certain employees so they could add people who are part of their teams. But, Vijeta tells Aaj Tak , Facebook didn't implement proper access right functionality in the tool. This allowed a low access right employee to reset the Company owner account and change owner's account details.\nAfter finding the bug, Vijeta informed Facebook about it. Facebook carried out its own investigation and found that Vijeta had indeed caught a serious security glitch in the Workplace. It decided to compensate Vijeta for her effort as well as has decided to include her in the list of bug bounty hall of fame.\n\"After reviewing this issue, We have decided to award you a bounty of $1000... You have identified an issue where a less powerful workplace admin could cause trouble for a more powerful admin though could not totally do an account takeover,\" Facebook told Vijeta. \"Great finding!\"\nMeanwhile, Vijeta says that although she is not a software engineer she will keep looking for bugs in software and services. \"I belong to a middle-class family and this reward is very important for me.

(File Photo)\nWhatsApp has reportedly added a new feature that will make it easy for users to notify people in their contact when they change their number. First spotted by WABetaInfo, the update is rolling out to WhatsApp beta for Android version 2.17.375. Despite upgrading to WhatsApp beta for Android version 2.17.377 ourselves, we were unable to find the feature working for us. It’s likely that the feature maybe enabled server side and rolling out to select users in a phased manner, eliminating the need to manually update the app through Google Play Store.\nChanging the number is possible by navigating to Settings > Account > Change number. WhatsApp has made it clear that changing the phone number will also migrate account info, groups, and settings. Users need to enter both their old/existing and new phone number in order to proceed. But since it only notifies the groups on Android, currently there’s no way users can notify the individuals when they change their number, unless they decide to do it manually themselves.\nWhatsApp may have figured the problem and accordingly implemented the feature on a short scale before making it available to everyone. The new feature reportedly lets users decide who they want to notify from the list of options such as all contacts, people they chat with, or a custom list of handpicked contacts. Some reports also say that using the feature will also transfer personal messages to a WhatsApp account associated with a new number.\nVideo of the day\nBJP's Sangeet Som Says,'Many Were Sad When Taj Mahal Was Removed From Historical Places.

PM10 are coarse pollutant particles.\nThe Supreme Court had on October 9 banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Territory (NCR) till November 1 during this Diwali to see the pollution level prevalent during this period.\n A day after Diwali, the air quality index (AQI) showed some improvement in pollution level compared with previous years.\nHowever, the improvement pollution level was minute. It certainly was not remarkable despite the ban on sale of crackers.\nPOLLUTION LEVEL ON DIWALI\nAccording to reports, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported today that the pollution levels in Delhi were slightly lower compared to the air quality recorded during Diwali in 2016. The air quality index value yesterday was 319 (Poor) while the air quality index last Diwali (October 30) had touched 431 (Severe).\nThe Delhi Pollution Control Committee's RK Puram real time pollution data monitoring station recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 878 and 1,179 micrograms per cubic metre respectively around 11 pm on Diwali.\nPM2.5 is the respirable tiny pollutant particles that enter the lungs and the blood stream causing severe health conditions. PM10 are coarse pollutant particles.\nThe pollution levels violated the corresponding 24-hour safe limits of 60 and 100 respectively by as much as 10 times.According to the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), a government agency under the Earth Science ministry, the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 154 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre respectively around 11 pm.\nSAFAR has also forecast relatively cleaner post-Diwali air due to favourable meteorological conditions, which are helping prevent the smoke-filled air from the agricultural belt of Haryana and Punjab from entering Delhi and NCR.\nINFERENCE\nGoing by the pollution level of Delhi and NCR recorded by different agencies on Diwali, it would appear that the air quality index deteriorated inspite of the ban on firecrackers. \nThis may indicate that there are larger culprits than bursting of crackers on Diwali responsible for spoiling the pollution level in Delhi and surrounding arreas.\nWeather conditions, air flow, burning of stubble in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab, industries, thermal power plants, vehicular emissions and dust could be the bigger culprits for the worsening of Delhi pollution level during Diwali.\nThis may mean that imposing ban on firecrackers has proved to be a short-cut and insufficient means to deal with air pollution in Delhi.\nInstead, emphasis should be laid on solving the bigger issues such as checking stubble burning, closing all industries and thermal power plants in and around Delhi, making roads dust-free, forcing builders to follow guidelines for under-construction buildings and the likes.\nThe ban on sale of crackers should be imposed only if the bigger measures do not yield the desired result.

Colloquially referred to simply as “Bullet Train”, this train will be able to achieve an average speed of over 250 kmph.\nIndia would soon see bullet trains similar to those used in Japan, as pictured. (Image: AFP)\nNew Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe inaugurated India’s first bullet train project on Thursday morning. News18 looks at what the fuss around India’s first “bullet train” is all about.\n How fast can it go? \n The Indian Railways network is the largest in the world and yet, it does not have a high-speed train. Colloquially referred to simply as “Bullet Train”, this train will be able to achieve an average speed of over 250 kmph. While it was designed to run at a maximum speed of 350 kmph, it will have the capability of achieving an operational maximum speed of 320 kmph. Presently available in 15 countries around the globe, it will be among the top ten fastest trains in the world. The fastest, however, remains the Maglev which runs in Shanghai, China at a speed of 430 kmph.\nHow long before it is ready?\n The government has promised that the first ‘Bullet train’ will run in less than five years. The MAHSR project received cabinet approval in 2015 and within two years, construction has already begun. The government had earlier set a deadline for December 2023. However, newly appointed Union Minister for Railways Piyush Goyal on Monday announced that the government had advanced the date of completion by more than a year. Goyal said the Bullet Train will make its first trip between Mumbai and Ahmedabad on August 15, 2022 – when India completes 75 years of independence.\nWhere can I board this train?\n The bullet train will connect Mumbai and Ahmedabad and will be linked by a total of 12 stations. Train will stop at Mumbai, Thane, Virar, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad, and Sabarmati stations. The Mumbai station will be underground while all others will be elevated.\nHow much time will the Mumbai-Ahmedabad journey take? \n Currently, a train journey between Mumbai and Ahmedabad can take anywhere between 7-8 hours. With the bullet train, passengers will be able to travel this distance in around 2-3 hours. If the train stops only at select stations, it will cover the distance in 2 hours and 7 minutes. If it stops at all 12 stations, it will take 2 hours and 58 minutes. The total distance of this high-speed rail link will be 508 kms. The bulk of this link, 351 kms, will run through the state of Gujarat – the PM’s home state – while 156 kms will run through the state of Maharashtra. A brief track of 2 kms will also pass through the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\nHow much will it cost and who’s paying for it?\n The project is a joint venture between Indian Railways and Japanese firm Shinkansen Technology. The total estimated cost is Rs. 1.08 lakh crore for the first rail link. Japan has agreed to give a soft loan to India, which will fund 81% of the entire project. According to the Ministry of Railways, such a loan from a body such as the World Bank would carry an interest of 5-7% with a repayment period of 25-35 years. However, the Japanese loan comes at an interest rate of 0.1% and India can repay it over a period of 50 years. The Indian government went as far as to say this loan was “tantamount to a grant”. The government of India will directly bear the rest of the cost.\n The project is expected to generate employment as well since over 20,000 people will employed during the construction and they will be used for similar projects in the future. Around 300 Indian Railway employees are currently being trained in Japan and an additional 4,000 will be trained at a High Speed Rail Training Institute at Vadodara, which will be operational by 2020.\nWill other cities get the bullet train too?\n Even the construction of the MAHSR project is being rolled out, the government is currently reviewing the feasibility of six other High-Speed Rail Links. These are Delhi-Mumbai, Delhi-Kolkata, Mumbai-Chennai, Delhi-Chandigarh, Mumbai-Nagpur and Delhi-Nagpur High-Speed Rail Links.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "68356a19_in", "news_id": "cdaadfacb02f0e857ff7b924d9b6c0b0_in", "title": "Bullet Train Can Take You From Mumbai to Ahmedabad in Two Hours: All You Need to Know", "ts": 1505381873, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/bullet-train-can-take-you-from-mumbai-to-ahmedabad-in-two-hours-all-you-need-to-know-1516747.html"}

The plea also alleged that Honeypreet was facing threat to life from drug mafias in Punjab and Haryana. \n The bail plea said she would cooperate with the investigation and sought three weeks’ transit bail.\n The bail plea, a copy of which has been accessed by News18, mentions a Greater Kailash address in Delhi.\n The residential building — House No A-4, Greater Kailash II — was raided by the Haryana Police on Tuesday in a bid to arrest Honeypreet and Aditya Insan, another close aide of jailed Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.\n However, the raid did not yield anything, DCP Southeast Romil Baaniya said. The raid was conducted at 7:30 am and only the caretaker was found, he said.\n The house was registered in the name of the Dera Sacha Sauda, Baaniya said.\n Police also said that any person giving any information leading to the arrest of the accused in connection with the incidents of violence in Panchkula on August 25 will be suitably rewarded and his/her identity kept secret.\n A court in Panchkula had on Monday issued arrest warrant against Honeypreet Insan, Dera spokesperson Aditya Insan, and Dera’s top functionary Pawan Insan in connection with incidents of violence in Panchkula.\n The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Haryana Police had moved an application before the court seeking arrest warrants of the three accused.\n Priyanka Taneja alias Honeypreet, the adopted daughter of the jailed Dera chief, tops the list of 43 persons 'wanted' by the Haryana Police in connection with incidents of violence that had followed Ram Rahim's conviction in the rape cases.\n Honeypreet, against whom a lookout notice was issued by the Haryana Police, had been earlier booked at Sector 5 police station in Panchkula.\n The police added her name in FIR number 345 as an accused in connection with the violence that took place in Panchkula on August 25.\n Her name has been included in the same FIR in which other Dera functionaries Aditya Insan and Surinder Dhiman, among others, had been booked for allegedly inciting violence and arson, police had said earlier.\n Haryana Police has also been questioning arrested Dera functionaries, including Dilawar Insan and Pradeep Goyal, to get concrete information about her place of hiding.

a16c5068_in	{"content": " NEW DELHI: Eating out is expected to get less taxing, with the GST Council likely to back a reduction in the levy on restaurants from 18% to 12% and withdrawal of the input tax credit facility available to eateries. \n The proposed change in the tax rate, discussed by a specially constituted group of state finance ministers, follows complaints that restaurants were pocketing the benefit of input tax credit for taxes paid by suppliers and the tax burden on those eating out was high. \n \"It is one segment that was not passing on the benefits to consumers,\" said a senior officer. \n If the change goes through, there will be two slabs for restaurants - 5% for those with a turnover of up to 1 crore that opt for the composition scheme and 12% for others. There is, however, no clarity on the levy at restaurants in five-star hotels at the moment. \n Currently, apart from those under the composition scheme, where the compliance burden is lower, the tax rate on air-conditioned restaurants is 18%, while that on non-AC joints is 12%. \"The idea is to have only two slabs but the final decision will be taken by the GST Council,\" said an official. \n When the rates were finalised, the GST Council was of the view that the actual levy for most restaurants will remain largely unchanged as they faced service tax as well as VAT earlier. In addition, the input tax credit was expected to make it less taxing for consumers but the government is now of the view that restaurants are being unfair. The withdrawal of input tax credit will make it a flat tax structure, with many suggesting that it will end GST on restaurants in its purest form. \n The new tax structure, along with the other proposals that the group of ministers is looking into, will be discussed during next month's meeting of the GST Council in Guwahati. \n In addition, the issue of reducing the number of items in the 28% bracket is expected to come up, a demand made by several state finance ministers, which seems to have found an endorsement at the Centre, too, with revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia going public about pruning the list. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "a16c5068_in", "news_id": "f9beb976ca0aa192c659e89dd2911766_in", "title": "Eating out could get cheaper as GST may be cut to 12%", "ts": 1508303752, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/eating-out-could-get-cheaper-as-gst-may-be-cut-to-12/articleshow/61124909.cms"}

fc70efa9_in	{"content": "Nokia is all set to launch the Nokia 8 in India at an event in New Delhi today. The Nokia 8 is not only the first high-end smartphone from Nokia since its gloomy Windows Phone days, it is the first flagship from the iconic Finnish company to run on Google's Android operating system. HMD Global, the company behind Nokia's revival has already launched the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 in India and now aims to capture the high-end market with the Nokia 8.\nWe took a look at the Nokia 8 a few weeks ago and came away mightily impressed. The Nokia 8 is crafted from a single block of series 6000 aluminum and comes with top of the line specifications, ZEISS powered dual cameras at the rear, 100 per cent stock Android, OZO audio and more.\n-- \nUPDATE\nNokia 8's price has been leaked on Amazon India ahead of launch. The smartphone has been listed on Amazon India's page just hours before its official unveiling with a price tag of Rs 36,999. The variant listed on the e-commerce site is the one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage storage and not the recently leaked model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The listing also points users towards a 'Notify Me' page.\n-- \nExpected India price\nThe smartphone retails for 599 Euros globally and is expected to be priced between Rs 40 to Rs 45,000 in India. While HMD Global is set to announce the smartphone in India today, reports indicate that actual sales will begin only in the second week of October via both offline and online channels.\nSpecifications\nAs expected of a late 2017 flagship, the Nokia 8 is a powerhouse. It comes Qualcomm's top of the line Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU, 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card and a 3,090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support. The Nokia 8 comes with an innovative heat management system - a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe dissipates heat across the full length and breadth of the smartphone.\nThe Snapdragon 835 processor has a lot of pixels to push thanks to the 5.2-inch Quad HD display on board the Nokia 8. The display is covered by Gorilla Glass 5 for protection against nicks and scratches and has a maximum brightness of 700 Nits. It also comes with an old Nokia favourite - Glance Screen - which displays the time, notifications and more even when the phone is turned off.\nZEISS dual cameras\nJust like the entire Nokia Android smartphone line-up, the Nokia 8 runs on a 100 percent stock build of Android 7.1.1 Nougat with an update to Android 8.0 Oreo along the way. On the imaging front, the Nokia 8 comes with a ZEISS powered dual camera setup at the rear - a primary 13MP RGB (color) sensor with optical image stabilisation paired with a 13MP secondary monochrome (black and white) sensor.\nThe secondary black and white sensor not only helps improve low-light photography by capturing more data, it also allows for the capture of images with depth of field effects. On the front, there is a 13MP sensor with phase detection autofocus and an aperture of f/2.which is also ZEISS certified.\nThe Nokia 8 also allows 'Dual-Sight' video to be live streamed natively and in real-time to social feeds such as YouTube and Facebook. Nokia calls this feature Bothie. The smartphone is IP68 dust and water resistant and allows for the capture of 360 degree 'OZO' audio via its three microphones and Nokia's special acoustic algorithms. \n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "fc70efa9_in", "news_id": "f472e2315bc6f1e9429e6439912b91a0_in", "title": "Nokia 8 with ZEISS dual cameras launching in India today, price leaked on Amazon", "ts": 1506404709, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/nokia-8-with-zeiss-dual-cameras-launching-in-india-today-expected-price-specs-and-more/1/1056014.html"}

File image\nNew Delhi: Ever since making his debut for India, all-rounder Hardik Pandya has become a key member of team India. The all-rounder has been instrumental in setting up many victories for India. He was recently handed Test debut against Sri Lanka and impressed one and all.\nNow former Australian captain Ian Chappell in his column for Hindustan Times has praised Pandya. “Hardik Pandya is potentially the pace bowling all-rounder India has craved since Kapil Dev retired. Pandya is a huge hit with the fans and was partly responsible for India dominating Australia in the recent ODI series,” wrote Chappell. \nChappell, however, believes that Pandya will be more of an asset to the Test team and will lend flexibility to the side.\n“A player like Pandya, who has the ability to bat in the top six and also bowl at 140 kph gives a Test side the flexibility that leads to success in all conditions. It affords India the opportunity to field a balanced attack of five bowlers no matter what the conditions,” Chappell added.\nChappell also had a suggestion for Pandya to be successful in overseas tours, especially in Australia and wants the budding all-rounder to look towards former Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad for inspiration.\n“If he needs inspiration in this regard he only needs look to former Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad. Miandad could be as annoying as a shovel grating on cement and he was constantly heckled in Australia but that only made him more determined,” he wrote.\n“Eventually Miandad was begrudgingly accorded the highest Australian sporting compliment; ‘He’s a bloody annoying opponent but we’d love to have him on our side’,” Chappell mentioned.\nIn his column, Chappell also compared Pandya to England’s controversial all-rounder Ben Stokes. \n“With his flamboyant style, Pandya reminds me a little of the electrifying England all-rounder Ben Stokes; the outstanding and highly combative cricketer on the field rather than the citizen with a propensity for self-destruction off it.”\n“Both players are aggressive in their approach and this often results in a match-changing performance or a deflating and spectacular misfire. Neither is concerned with containment and this can lead to the odd profligate spell of bowling,” he added.\n", "domain": "india.com", "entry_id": "2767ae31_in", "news_id": "3b19a2df90d31cc4e9dbe68fbce96a83_in", "title": "Hardik Pandya Can be India’s Next Kapil Dev: Ian Chappell", "ts": 1508069256, "url": "http://www.india.com/sports/hardik-pandya-can-be-indias-next-kapil-dev-ian-chappell-2533859/"}

d3e4d94b_in	{"content": "The weight other South Asian countries attach to the Chinese influence is much larger than they attach to frictionless ties with India, given these countries also run trust deficits with India.\n  The issue of sovereignty in determining the prospects and credibility of connectivity initiatives became evident again with respect to the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI) in Asia. (PTI) \nThe issue of sovereignty in determining the prospects and credibility of connectivity initiatives became evident again with respect to the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI) in Asia. At a trilateral meeting of external affairs ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last month, US and Japan backed India in calling for regional connectivity plans based on international norms, prudent financing and respect for territorial sovereignty. Endorsements by the US and Japan were taken as vindication of the Indian reservation on China’s BRI. However, territorial sovereignty might not be the deciding factor for many other countries in locking on to connectivity initiatives. This was evident from the recent statement of the Bangladesh foreign secretary at Delhi, where he confirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to the BRI and emphasised that there are occasions on which economic considerations outweigh sovereignty.\nThe approach to China’s BRI till now has been characterised by contrasts. India leads opinions that are pessimistic about the BRI. While the latter directly pertains to India’s territorial concerns, the US, Japan and Europe are, at varying degrees, concerned over multiple aspects of the project. A large part of these concerns, particularly for the US and Japan, relate to apprehensions over BRI institutionalising a China-centric regional order. Europe has mixed views on the project. While lacking a continental view on BRI’s advancement of a China-centric order, given that European countries like Greece, Hungary and Poland are heavily enthusiastic about BRI, movers and shakers of the European establishment are wary over its commitment to institutional norms and nature of project financing. These views contrast with the great appetite for BRI in several other parts of its geography, particularly in Southeast, South and Central Asia. The Bangladesh response to BRI symbolises this enthusiasm.\nThe enthusiasm for BRI is not difficult to explain. BRI has been projected by China as not only a plan for building rail, road and ports across vast swathes of land and sea, but also as a programme that would connect countries digitally and culturally. The ‘Digital Silk Road’ is an alluring prospect for countries that are waiting to latch on to the exciting prospects of e-commerce. People-to-people linkages—one of China’s major diplomatic thrusts for global engagement for several years now—are also driven deep into the agenda for BRI. For most countries in Asia and Africa, and even for some in Europe, BRI signals money, mobility and modernisation assured by a generous lender.\nMoney talks and China is making it talk as well as it can. South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal are aware of the pitfalls of locking on to BRI. Apart from the geostrategic downside of irking China by staying out of the project, building infrastructure through BRI might involve much greater costs than are currently envisaged. The Sri Lankan experience points to the long-term implications of Chinese soft loans and investments that extract commercial and strategic prices. But notwithstanding such knowledge, the rest of South Asia is not in a position to turn their backs on BRI. China’s gigantic economy, strategic clout and the almost fantastic investment that it has committed to the BRI, which by some estimates run into trillions of dollars, are too strong and heady to even contemplate rejection.\nSouth Asian countries in India’s neighbourhood also need to reconcile to the fact that for Chinese investments, it is no more a question of following the signals of political commitment. While the Chinese top leadership might commit several billions in many countries as a mark of China’s commitment to their development, actual investment by Chinese companies would only follow after careful assessment of risks involved. Like all other global investors, Chinese companies have become increasingly wary of risks to their investments in countries that have weak governance and poor institutions. Adding political instability, which never really deserts most South Asian countries, Chinese investors would be careful and all that has been promised might not materialise.\nNonetheless, the BRI will continue to advance as a vision and project that would increase the strategic gulf between China and India in South Asia. Except Pakistan, all other South Asian countries will be trying to perfect the art of ‘balancing’ China and India on the BRI. This difficult act would call for deft diplomacy on part of all countries. China, and needless to say India, would try to match each other in strategic influence over the region. The fact that the rest of the region has not backed off from the BRI despite noting India’s territorial concerns means they have not been convinced about BRI being a new ‘colonial enterprise’—an impression that India sought to forcefully convey when it refused to attend the BRI Forum at Beijing in May this year. Or, as is possibly more likely, despite being convinced, the weight to the Chinese influence is too much and too large for these much smaller countries that also run trust deficits with India. South Asia would no more be the same after BRI as China and India sniff and scowl over it.\n", "domain": "financialexpress.com", "entry_id": "d3e4d94b_in", "news_id": "5b94a29b2cb4fcbc329e49b68f55fe75_in", "title": "India, China and Belt and Road Initiative: This is what will likely happen now", "ts": 1508124255, "url": "http://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/india-china-and-belt-and-road-initiative-this-is-what-will-likely-happen-now/895923/"}

Airtel and Idea-Vodafone were quick to follow the trend but still haven't been able to produce any device commercially. However, state-owned BSNL is gearing up to launch its new phone at a price around Rs 2,000. \nAccording to a report by ETTelecom, the company has even revealed a time-frame for the launch of the device. \"Our strategy is away from procurement. We are trying to come up with our own bundled phone equipments and in about a month time, you will see co-branded feature phones with various manufactures will come,\" BSNL chairman Anupam Shrivastava\nThe companies will be working with Indian phone manufacturers like Micromax and Lava to build this new device. According to the company, they will be launching the device with bundled voice packages. This new deal with Indian manufacturers will help them revive from the falling market share in lieu of the aggressive competition from their Chinese counterparts like Oppo, Xiaomi and Vivo. \nHowever, there is no specific mention of the device being 4G-capable. Reliance Jio on the other hand launched a feature phone that's able to use the 4G spectrum for basic media applications. \nDespite that, BSNL enjoys a prominent position in the Indian market and enjoys a relatively stable market in comparison to the other big telecom companies. Since BSNL will be launching cheap voice offers on the feature phone, the device is expected to sell well in the semi-urban parts of the country which still measure up to be the majority of the entire phone market. \nThe launch of feature phones or smartphones at price of feature phones has re-ignited the otherwise dormant ultra-cheap phone segment. BSNL will be looking forward to launch the new device before Diwali (October 19) this year to cash-in on the festive season. \n", "domain": "businesstoday.in", "entry_id": "bf159b11_in", "news_id": "a3386329748b704eadc3dc61990ffebf_in", "title": "BSNL to take on Reliance Jio with feature phone priced around Rs 2000 before Diwali", "ts": 1505728595, "url": "http://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/bsnl-to-take-on-reliance-jio-with-feature-phone-priced-around-rs-2000-before-diwali/story/260508.html"}

Data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that air quality in the national capital remained \"very poor\", two days after Diwali.\nDiwali celebrations in 2016 shrouded the entire national capital and adjoining regions in a thick smog for days – the worst in 17 years. Residents choked for the next few months due to the crop burning by farmers in Haryana and Punjab.\nWith an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 389 on Saturday, the CPCB said that it was the same as on November 1, 2016 – two days after Diwali.\nAccording to Mahesh Palawat, Director of private weather forecaster Skymet, it is due to calmness in wind speed as compared to last year.\n\"Last year, wind blowing at a higher speed played a crucial role in improving air quality after Diwali. But this year, wind is blowing at a speed less than 10 km per hour and therefore is not able to suspend particulate matters' spread around us,\" Palawat said.\nHowever, he predicted that things would improve in the coming days as there were chances of rise in wind speed.\n\"Coincidentally, the air quality index two days after Diwali remains the same as last year,\" Vivek Chattopadhyaya, air quality expert at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told IANS, adding that weather also played a crucial role in air quality.\nHowever, he pointed out that an increase in number of monitoring stations over the last one year might also have contributed to recording higher level of pollution.\nHowever, he said compared to last year, there was slight improvement in the visibility and air quality index post Diwali and for this, \"credit goes to the Supreme Court which has banned the sale of firecrackers\".\n\"There were six monitoring stations in 2016, while this year it is 16,\" he said.\nHe cited October 21, 2016's air quality index which was 264, falling under \"poor category\".\nHigh humidity, low wind speed and low temperatures meant the pollutants hovered very close to the surface and could not be dispersed, he added.\nThe Supreme Court ban on sale of firecrackers did not prevent people from lighting sparklers, rockets and loud Diwali \"bombs\" though the volume was lower than previous years. Some people claimed to have travelled out of the city or shopped online to buy firecrackers, while many claimed they used last year's leftover stock to celebrate Diwali.\nThe court on October 9 affirmed the ban it had imposed on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR). The court said the ban would be in effect till November 1.\nExpressing concern over poor implementation of the Supreme Court ban on the sale of fire crackers in Delhi-NCR, industry chamber Assocham on Saturday said ensuring a clean environment should be a combined responsibility of the Centre, the state governments, civil society and public at large and not of the apex court alone.\n\"The economic interest of the traders and the manufacturers was involved; but once the Supreme Court had banned sale of firecrackers, the enforcement of the order should have been ensured by the Union Environment Ministry, Delhi government and the state governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in entire NCR,\" said D.S.

The app is likely to be unveiled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.\n\"Send money home to your family, split a dinner bill with friends, or pay the neighbourhood chaiwala.

The ratings for the app range from one star to five. Although people have liked the design of the app -- it is a typical Google app, easy to use and designed with flat and classy material design -- many are complaining that the app is not connecting to their bank accounts.\nGoogle in a bid to push the app is offering referral rewards. It is asking users to refer the app to friends and if they sign and make a payment using it, you and your friend each will get Rs 51 reward. You can refer the app to as many people as you want although the maximum reward is limited to the Rs 9000. The referral offer, according to Google, will be valid until April 1, 2018.\nCurrently, India's e-payment market is dominated by Paytm, even though government took has its own BHIM app, which too uses UPI interface. However, the Tez and Paytm are two very different apps. Whole Tez acts as a payment interface for UPI, Paytm is a wallet app. Apps like Tez use the money in a bank account to enable payments. Apps like Paytm require that users keep money in e-wallets for the payment.\n", "domain": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "entry_id": "4f1f3_in", "news_id": "570721fb58e34f2ebe148e2ca4bc9364_in", "title": "Google launches Tez payment app in India, lures users with up to Rs 9,000 reward", "ts": 1505713878, "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/google-launches-tez-payment-app-in-india-lures-users-with-up-to-rs-9000-reward/1/1050288.html"}

The board members discussed Kejriwal's proposal but decided to go ahead with recommendations of Fare Fixation Committee (FCC), to be made effective from October 10.\n Nominee directors of the Delhi government conveyed that the CM wanted the postponement of the fare hike and formation of a new FFC. The Board was informed that under Section 37 of the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, recommendations of the FFC are binding on metro rail authorities. \n Subsequently, the Board noted that it does not have the authority to consider/defer implementation of the recommendations of the FFC. \n Kejriwal had written to the Housing and Urban Affairs (HUA) Ministry to issue a direction to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to put on hold the proposed hike in fares, as recommended by 4th Fare Fixation Committee (FCC). \n The Centre has informed the Delhi government that the Metro Act does not allow it to put on hold the hike in Delhi Metro fares which will be effective from October 10, an official had said on Saturday.\n The Centre, however, said a fresh committee to fix fares could be considered if the Delhi government agrees to provide over Rs 3,000 crore every year to DMRC, said the source, quoting a letter sent on Friday by union minister Hardeep Singh Puri to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. \n Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, in response to Kejriwal's letter, said, \"Your suggestion that this ministry direct that the fare increase be kept on hold overlooks the fact the central government does not have any such authority. Tampering with the recommendations of FFC is legally untenable.\" \n Fares will go up by a maximum of Rs 10 after the latest hike comes into effect. \n The existing fare structure is: up to 2 kms - Rs 10, 2-5 kms - Rs 15, 5-12 kms - Rs 20, 12-21 kms - Rs 30, 21-32 kms - Rs 40 and for journeys beyond 32 kms - Rs 50. \n From October 10, for a distance of up to two kilometres, the fare will remain Rs 10, but for a distance between two and five kilometres, it will go up from Rs 15 to Rs 20. For the subsequent slabs, it will go up by Rs 10 each, which means the maximum fare will be Rs 60.\n", "domain": "news18.com", "entry_id": "bbcbbd40_in", "news_id": "0b2a0652f80f1adb5727d77c9c3db324_in", "title": "Delhi Metro Fare to Increase Today As DMRC Rejects Kejriwal's Request", "ts": 1507604944, "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/india/delhi-metro-fare-to-increase-tomorrow-as-dmrc-rejects-kejriwals-request-1541367.html"}

33f3cb57_in	{"content": "Unbeaten India are going for their third Asia Cup title today. \nFULL-TIME\nFourth quarter (IND 2 - 0 MAL)\n60th min. Skipper Manpreet to the fore as he takes the long ball down cooly and kills off the time. Fist title in ten years for India.\n59th min. Manpreet Singh, deliberately or not, clears the ball. Then, from the following the play, a crash ball almost finds the equaliser for Malaysia.\n58th min. Desperate for the equaliser, Malaysians sacrificed their goalkeeper and fields all 11 outfield players. Stick check, that's what Malaysians are calling for the yellow card. Sumit, lucky. His knee drops and umpires check if the young Indian player did it deliberately or not. No deliberate action, is the call. Malaysia win the free-hit from another foul but lose the referral.\n56th min. India are out of the referrals, but Akashdeep forgets it. He goes straight to umpire Michihiko Watanabe, but the Japanese umpire calms him down. Then, on the Malaysian counter, Varun panicked and PC to the attackers. His bid to control the long ball was amateurish, to say the least. Looking away from the flight of the ball, and you paid the price. Ball lands in his foot.\n54th min. India seem to have cracked under the pressure, lose possession in a childish fashion, couple of times. Even Sardar Singh looks out of sorts while defending. Meanwhile. Indian goalie takes just the perfect time-out needed by his outfield players. Unstrapping his pads, cooling himself down. Moments ago, he was left exposed one on one with Tengku Tajuddin. Luckily for India, there was a foot foul.\n50th min. GOAL for Malaysia. India challenges it. But it remains. Malaysia are back in the match. Credit to Shahril Saabah for keeping his cool to tap in the rising ball from a Indian deflection.\n49th min. SV Sunil opts to go solo and he's floored inside the Malaysian circle. No worries though. Gets up promptly and joined the play. On a decent build-up, Fitri Saari fails to trap a perpendicular pass. Could have been a decent chance.\n47th min. Ramandeep starts the proceedings from the centre, then soon concede a PC to Malaysia even as a furious Surender Kumar shows his anger to the umpire. He was blocking the Malaysian player. Faizal Saari just misses the target by a whisker. What a good attempt from the diminutive drag-flicker.\nThird quarter (IND 2 - 0 MAL)\n45th min. Anxious moments just outside the India circle, but India do well to clear the danger. Hooter!\n44th min. Ramandeep picks up a pin-point pass, then spins before going for the goal. Just missed by a whisker.\n43rd min. Another brilliant move from the Indians. Lalit, who's running through the circle, gets checked by three Malaysian defenders but no call from the umpire.\n42nd min. Lalit, then, gets a relatively easy chance to increase the lead, but his swing to meet the bouncing ball goes awry. Kumar Subramaniam, however, manages well to block Jugraj who's also going for the ball.\n40th min. Saqtbir makes a mess of his run, tangling the stick between his legs and SV Sunil turns with a realistically goal-scoring chance inside the Malaysian circle.\n38th min. Malaysia get back-to-back attacks with Shahril Saabah leading the charge. Forced to check the backline, Sardar Singh bravely pulls the ball out of danger zone.\n36th min. Huge moment with India almost hitting the plank for the third time. More than enough body inside the Malaysian circle, at least four, but none of them managed to get to the ball.\n34th min. Moments later, Ramandeep, on his free role, gets a nasty deflection hit his shin while going for a loose ball. On the other end, Malaysia make a mess of their chance, losing the ball on the byline.\n32nd min. Tengku Ahmad Tajuddin fails to keep the ball in play after a cross-field cross tries to reach him. Then, Ramandeep Singh presses hard, winning a long corner. One of the Malaysian players could have ended with a card after his flailing stick obstructs an India.\nFIRST-HALF\nSecond quarter (IND 2 - 0 MAL)\n30th min. After conceding the second goal, Malaysia continue to probe the India defence. But India are too good. Hooter!\n29th min. Defensive lapse from Razie Rahim allows India breach the pocket in the near corner. But India fail to create a chance. Then, from the following play, Lalit times his slide perfectly to connect the cross and GOAL! \n26th min. Malaysia, meanwhile, get their own chance. Then India responds with a swift counter. Akashdeep, one on one with the Malaysia goalie, goes for a direct hit. But there's a good save. PC for India. Wasted.\n25th min. Old wily foxes, Sardar Singh and SV Sunil combine well in front of the Malaysia box; but the final move fails to create the desire chance.\n23rd min. PC for India, thanks to Ramandeep Singh's brilliant stick work on the turn. No challenge. Clear call. Chinglensana stops the ball in the first castle, then Harmanpreet's drag-flick hits the target but deflected from a stick. Long corner for India.\n21st min. SV Sunil wins the ball on the left flank, then makes an inroad in the opposition half. But somehow, Malaysians got a crash ball with Faizal Saari missing the target. Huge moment.\n18th min. Manpreet Singh wins the ball near the near corner and launches a swift attack involving Chinglensana and Harmanpreet, but to avail...\n17th min. India looking to find the chink in the Malaysian defence. After conceding that early goal, Malaysians have managed to play on a high level, challenging the Indians.\nFirst quarter (IND 1 - 0 MAL)\n15th min. Last move of the quarter from the Indians.\n14th min. PC for Malaysia with Ramandeep trapping the ball with his foot. Sardar Singh gets a good move running but, he fails to connect the minus and Malaysians are on it.\n12th min. India get another probing move, but the Malaysians responded in style, with a counter-attack.\n10th min. Azri Hassan furiously makes his complaint heard to the umpire. He claims that there's a 'foot' as he crosses a ball inside the Indian circle. Umpire called it a high ball thus declaring it a dangerous ball. Sardar Singh's the player in the target here.\n7th min. Good period of play for the Malaysians, but Gurjant Singh wins a ball in the midfield duel. But the two-time champions fail to make the most out of the move.\n5th min. Malaysia challenge a PC call, and it proved a good one. Umpire thought it was a dangerous ball with the ball getting deflected from an Indian cross.\n3rd min. GOAL! Perfect start for India as Ramandeep Singh slots home the first goal from a defensive error. Brilliant.\n2nd min. It takes a couple of minutes for India to have a go at the Malaysian goal. Not the typical penetration, but a good sign.\n17:05 pm IST: \nHere’s Team India’s XI for the grand finale vs Malaysia in the #HeroAsiaCup 2017 (Men) on 22nd Oct. #INDvMAS\nStar Sports & Hotstar pic.twitter.com/TFfMwjc6as\n— Hockey India (@TheHockeyIndia) October 22, 2017\n16:41 pm IST: Here are the squads\nIndia: Goalkeepers - Akash Chikte, Suraj Karkera; Defenders - Dipsan Tirkey, Kothajit Khadangbam, Surender Kumar, Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar; Midfielders - SK Uthappa, Sardar Singh, Manpreet Singh (captain), Chinglensana Kangujam, Sumit; Forwards - S.V.

The neighbour nation also has a rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal systems “of 130–140 warheads and an increasing portfolio of delivery systems.”\nOut of the nine locations, four are near Pakistan's Punjab, three near Sindh province and one each around Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \nThe report published by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) says “Islamabad is quantitatively and qualitatively increasing its arsenal and deploying weapons at more sites, yet the locations are difficult to pinpoint.”\nThe report, authored by Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S. Norris, estimates that Pakistan has stored its nuclear arsenal in the following nine locations:\n1. Akro Garrison, Sindh (Possible underground weapons storage site)\n 2. Gujranwala Garrison, Punjab (Possible weapons storage with components in remote depot)\n 3. Khuzdar Garrison, Balochistan (Possible underground weapons storage site)\n 4.

They did not give the Indian strikers any space to create chances. \n Four minutes from the final hooter, India withdrew goalkeeper Suraj Karkera for an extra player and the move paid rich dividends as Gurjant finally scored the much-needed equaliser in the last minute of the match. \n The Indians went full throttle and the move paid off when Gurjant scored from a rebound after his initial shot was saved by the Korean goalkeeper, much to the relief of new chief coach Sjoerd Marijne. \n India will next play impressive Malaysia in their second Super 4 stage match on Thursday. \n Earlier in the day, Malaysia defeated Pakistan 3-2 in another Super 4 encounter. \n India's last Super 4 match is against arch-rivals Pakistan, whom they have defeated 3-1 in the pool stages. \n As per the tournament rules, the top two teams from the Super 4 stage will qualify for the final to be held on Sunday. \n", "domain": "m.timesofindia.com", "entry_id": "c3f1f019_in", "news_id": "d3e6e70a71de9a25031ffad35db401f0_in", "title": "Asia Cup hockey: Gurjant late strike helps India secure 1-1 draw against South Korea", "ts": 1508349164, "url": "https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/asia-cup-hockey-gurjant-late-strike-helps-india-secure-1-1-draw-against-south-korea/articleshow/61134011.cms"}
