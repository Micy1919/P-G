VYangon:  Supporters of Myanmar's opposition icon Aung San Suu Kyi erupted in euphoric cheers on Sunday after her party said she won a parliamentary seat in a landmark election, setting the stage for her to take public office for the first time.\u000aThe victory, if confirmed, would mark a major milestone in the Southeast Asian nation, where the military has ruled almost exclusively for a half-century and where a new reform-minded government is seeking legitimacy and a lifting of Western sanctions.\u000aIt would also mark the biggest prize of Suu Kyi's political career, and a spectacular reversal of fortune for the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate who the former junta had kept imprisoned in her lakeside home for the better part of two decades.\u000aThe victory claim was displayed on a digital signboard above the opposition National League for Democracy's headquarters in Myanmar's main city, Yangon, where more than 1,000 supporters began wildly shouting upon learning the news.\u000a"We won! We won!" her supporters chanted while clapping, dancing, waving red party flags and gesturing with thumbs-up and V-for-victory signs.\u000aEarlier, the party had claimed that Suu Kyi was ahead with 65 percent of the vote in 82 of her constituency's 129 polling stations. The party had staff and volunteers spread throughout the vast rice-farming district, who were calling in preliminary results by phone to their headquarters in Yangon.\u000aThe results must be confirmed by the official electoral commission, however, which has yet to release any outcome and may not make an official declaration for days.\u000aThe victory claim came despite allegations by her National League for Democracy party that "rampant irregularities" had taken place on voting day. Party spokesman Nyan Win said that by midday alone the party had filed more than 50 complaints to the Election Commission. He said most alleged violations concerned waxed ballot papers that made it difficult to mark votes. There were also ballot cards that lacked the Election Commission's seal, which would render them invalid.\u000aSunday's by-election was called to fill just 45 vacant seats in Myanmar's 664-seat national Parliament and will not change the balance of power in a new government that is nominally civilian but still heavily controlled by retired generals. Suu Kyi and other opposition candidates would have almost no say even if they win all the seats they are contesting.\u000aBut her candidacy has resurrected hope among Myanmar's downtrodden masses, who have grown up for generations under strict military rule. If Suu Kyi takes office as expected, it would symbolize a giant leap toward national reconciliation.\u000a"She may not be able to do anything at this stage," said one voter, Go Khehtay, who cast his ballot for Suu Kyi at Wah Thin Kha, one of the dirt-poor villages in the rural constituency south of Yangon that she is vying to represent. "But one day, I believe she'll be able to bring real change."\u000a

VAjmer:  24-year-old Swapandeep Kaur hardly has any memories of her father, having met him last as a toddler. But Sarabjit Singh's daughter still hopes to see him - her father has been languishing in a jail in Pakistan for the last 22 years and is on death row.\u000aSarabjit's family contends that he crossed the border into Pakistan by mistake in August 1990, when there was no demarcated border between the both nations. He was then arrested and put behind bars. Accused of being a RAW agent, Sarabjit was convicted and sentenced to death for his alleged involvement in serial bomb blasts that killed 14 people in 1990.\u000aIn 2008, Sarabjit's family was allowed see him in a prison in Lahore. It is during this visit that he told his family of what exactly happened in 1990. He also said that he was totally ignorant of the documents that he was signing on since they were written in Urdu, a language he didn't speak or understand.\u000aRecalling the emotional reunion that lasted for 38 minutes, his family members tell NDTV that they could barely speak. It, incidentally, was also the first time Sarabjit saw his youngest daughter, Poonam, who was just 23 days old when he was arrested in Pakistan.\u000aAnsar Burney, a renowned human rights activist in Pakistan, has recently sent a mercy petition for Sarabjit to President Asif Ali Zardari.\u000aSarabji's family too continues to fight for him. His sister, Dalbir Kaur, and his daughter, Swapandeep, are in Ajmer to appeal to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari who will also be in the city to offer prayers at the famous dargah (shrine) of sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.\u000a"Mercy petition of my brother is pending with Zardari. I would urge from him to release my brother. Since he will be visiting Ajmer dargah on Sunday, I am also going there with a wish of my brother's release which is in the hands of Zardari," Dalbir Kaur had earlier told reporters.\u000aLike most devotees, Sarabjit's family too would be hoping that their prayers and wishes would be answered at the dargah.\u000a

VChoi Hyun-Min loses all track of time when he sits down to play computer games, but the sessions usually last at least 10 hours.\u000a\u000aChoi (not his real name) is among hundreds of thousands officially considered to be Internet addicts in South Korea, one of the world's most wired nations.\u000a\u000aNow the 16-year-old student is undergoing therapy at the "Save Brain Clinic", which opened in early May and styles itself as the country's first specialist clinic for such addicts.\u000a\u000a"Internet addiction is not mere delinquency," said Lee Jaewon, who heads the clinic at Gongju National Hospital, a psychiatric institution 120 km (74 miles) south of Seoul.\u000a\u000a"It is a serious issue and parents need to feel less embarrassed and bring children to hospitals for treatment before it's too late."\u000a\u000aThe clinic offers a five-week treatment programme including group sessions, art therapy, medicine and processes known as neurofeedback and transcranial magnetic stimulation.\u000a\u000aNeurofeedback uses real-time displays to illustrate brain activity, measured through scalp sensors, with the aim of controlling central nervous system activity.\u000a\u000aTranscranial magnetic stimulation uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain and is more commonly employed to treat depression.\u000a\u000aBefore treatment starts, the hospital provides a diagnosis through a survey, a brain image scan and psychological tests.\u000a\u000a"Both tests and treatment programmes are scientific and to a certain extent proven effective," Lee told AFP.\u000a\u000aThe test and treatment fee is 630,000 won (585 dollars) with government insurance coverage, and up to 1,940,000 won without.\u000a\u000aMany parents have made inquiries. But only three people, including Choi, began the five-week course, which intends to focus on adolescents but is also open to adults.\u000a\u000aLee said parents have difficulty admitting their children have problems and feel embarrassed to bring them to a mental hospital.\u000a\u000aAlthough Internet addiction is not accepted as a mental disorder, he said, the problem is already deep-rooted in South Korean society.\u000a\u000a"Playing online games is fun, thrilling and comforting at the same time," Choi, clad in a hospital gown, told AFP. "All I think about is how to play without being interrupted."\u000a\u000aHis addiction began around age nine. Once, he said, he punched a hole in the window of his parents' room to retrieve a computer monitor which they had locked away.\u000a\u000aHe had also stolen money to play at Internet cafes for hours, snacking on instant cup noodles.\u000a\u000aEarly last year, Lee said, a 31-year old man was brought to the hospital by his parents after playing games in an Internet cafe for 780 hours excluding short breaks.\u000a\u000aThere have also been several fatal incidents. Last year a mother was arrested for killing her three-year-old son while she was tired from Internet game-playing.\u000a\u000aA 15-year-old boy committed suicide after killing his mother for scolding him over excessive playing of computer games.\u000a\u000aIn an especially tragic case, a 41-year-old man was sentenced to two years in prison after he and his wife left their baby daughter to die at home of malnutrition while they were in Internet cafes.\u000a\u000aThey were raising a "virtual child" in an online game.\u000a\u000aFigures from the family ministry estimate there are two million Internet addicts in a nation of 48.6 million. Among them, 877,000 are aged between nine and 19.\u000a\u000aDespite strong opposition from the computer games industry, parliament passed a bill forcing online game companies to block users aged under 16 from playing between midnight and 6.00 am.\u000a\u000aIt goes into force this November.\u000a\u000aWhile the government ponders policies to prevent Internet addiction, Lee said his clinic will focus on treatment as early as possible.\u000a\u000a"It will be too late if we only start treatment after Internet addiction has been acknowledged as a mental disease," he said.\u000a\u000a"We will start now, hoping more medical effort and attention will be given to the issue."

It will possibly increase to around 10 per cent by 2016-17, which is still a very small share of the total market."\u000aHe, however, said there will be increase in efficiency in the overall sector.\u000aThe issues concerning supply chain management will not be completely addressed through allowing FDI, he said.\u000aAjit Joshi, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Infiniti Retail (which runs retail chain Croma), said the government should clarify certain rules for facilitating investment.

VThe world's wheat and rice producers are headed for a record harvest this year, drastically reducing the global food bill as prices fall, the FAO said on Thursday.\u000aOverall cereal production is projected to rise by 1.5 percent this year from 2015, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said in its food outlook.\u000aThe bumper output will boost food inventories and bring prices down, pushing down the value of total food imports by 11 percent in US dollar terms "as lower bills for livestock products and cereal-based foodstuffs more than offset higher bills for fish, fruits and vegetables, oils and particularly sugar," it said.\u000aHowever many poorer nations will fail to benefit from the windfall, the FAO warned, because their currencies have weakened, eliminating the benefits of cheaper food through a worsening exchange rate.\u000aGlobal wheat production increases are being led by India, the US and Russia, which is "poised to overtake the European Union as the grain's largest exporter".\u000aMeanwhile, rice production has received a great boost from abundant monsoon rains in Asia and output rises in Africa, adding to record crops for coarse grain in the US, Argentina and India.\u000aFutures prices on the Chicago market for wheat and maize, which is seeing a recovery in output, have fallen by over 16 percent since the start of the year in anticipation of the supply increases, the FAO noted, while rice price quotes are at their lowest since 2008.\u000aProduction of cassava, a staple crop in Africa, is projected to rise by 2.6 percent this year.\u000aSoybeans and other oilcrops could reach a production record this year, although supply is being outstripped by surging demand, the FAO said.\u000a© 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VOslo:  Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, scientists said on Monday.\u000aSix glaciers, eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent, were flowing fast into the Amundsen Sea, according to the report based partly on satellite radar measurements from 1992 to 2011.\u000aEvidence shows "a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat", said lead author Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\u000aThe coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said. He likened the process to uncorking a full bottle of wine while it was lying on its side.\u000aThis part of Antarctica would be a major contributor to sea level rise in coming decades and centuries since the glaciers hold enough ice to raise sea levels by 1.2 metres (4 feet).\u000a"It's passed the point of no return," he told a telephone news conference.\u000aIce-penetrating radars showed no mountain ranges entombed under the ice, for instance, that could halt the flow. The fastest retreat was 34-37 km (21-23 miles) over the period in the Smith/Kohler glacier.\u000aEven so, cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, part of efforts to rein in global warming, could at least slow the slide of the Pine Island, Thwaites, Haynes, Pope, Smith and Kohler glaciers.\u000a"We do think this is related to climate warming," Rignot said. The scientists believed that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was affecting wind patterns around Antarctica, driving warmer waters towards the continent.\u000aAlmost 200 nations have agreed to work out a UN pact by the end of 2015 to combat global warming, which the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says will cause more floods, droughts, heat waves and higher seas.\u000aSEA LEVELS\u000aMonday's findings may also mean that scenarios by the IPCC for sea level rise are too low. The IPCC said last year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 26 and 82 cm (10 and 32 inches) by the late 21st century, after a 19 cm (7 inch) rise since 1900.\u000a"The major ice sheets of this planet will have a larger and larger role in sea level rise in the decades ahead," said Sridhar Anandakrishnan, professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study.\u000aLast week, another study also suggested a part of the far bigger ice sheet in East Antarctica may also be more vulnerable than expected to thaw. The IPCC says it is at least 95 percent probable that warming is caused by human activities, led by the burning of fossil fuels.\u000aMonday's study, to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, adds to signs of climate change under way.\u000aOn May 6, the Obama administration issued a study saying that warming "once considered an issue for a distant future has moved firmly into the present."\u000aAnd the IPCC said in March there were signs of irreversible changes to tropical coral reefs and to the Arctic.\u000aA separate study of the Thwaites glacier by the University of Washington in the journal Science also said it may have begun an unstoppable collapse that could last from 200 to 1,000 years.\u000aA disappearance of the Thwaites alone would raise world sea levels by 60 cm (1.96 feet) but the "glacier also acts as a linchpin on the rest of the ice sheet, which contains enough ice to cause another three to four metres of sea level rise", it said.\u000aThe findings contrast with a paradoxical expansion of the extent of ice floating on the sea around Antarctica in recent winters that the scientists said may be part of natural variations. "The changes in the glacier reflect much longer-term processes," Tom Wagner, a scientist with NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in the telephone briefing.\u000a

VIndia's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said we cannot also allow the veto to have a veto over the process of UNSC reform itself.\u000aUnited Nations:  As differences persist among UN member states on the key issue of veto, India has asserted that the topic cannot be allowed to block the process of Security Council reform and called for consolidating the negotiating text on the basis of convergence reached so far.\u000a"The issue of veto is important but then we cannot also allow the veto to have a veto over the process of Council reform itself," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said yesterday.\u000a"Our own national position has been and remains that the veto should as long as it exists be extended to new permanent members," he said.\u000aMr Akbaruddin urged the chair of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) to consolidate the negotiating text on the basis of convergence reached on issues so far while also delineating the divergence and the contrarian view of some.\u000aHe stressed that that chair should ask member states to build further on the consolidated and shortened text. Reiterating India's national position on the issue of veto, Mr Akbaruddin said as long as the veto exists, it should be extended to new permanent members in a reformed Security Council.\u000aHe further suggested that as a measure of "flexibility and willingness for compromise", the use of the veto can be deferred till the Review Conference.\u000a"The African Union (and this is understandable) does not wish to defer use. The difference, we see, as one of a degree than one of a kind," he said during the informal plenary meeting of the IGN on 'Question of Veto'.\u000aGiving an elaborate historical perspective on the use of the veto in the 70-year history of the UN, Mr Akbaruddin said from the time the Security Council was created in 1946 till today, 317 vetoes have been cast and as result 230 draft resolutions or parts thereof have been vetoed in total.\u000aIn effect 10 per cent of the 2,271 resolutions adopted till date have been vetoed.\u000aHe further underscored that apart from the use of the veto within the Security Council, there have been expansion of the veto to the Council's subsidiary bodies such as the Sanctions Committees.\u000aMr Akbaruddin said in these bodies the veto has been extended to all 15 members of the Committees who can block, or object or place on hold any request of a Member State, thereby in effect killing the proposal on grounds that consensus is required.\u000a"As the well known idiom goes, 'if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck'. Yes...we have by a procedural stratagem expanded the veto to all members of the subsidiary bodies of the Security Council far from restraining its use," he said.\u000aHe stressed that given the history of the use of veto, it is not surprising that a significant number of member states call for abolition of the veto or to limit and curtail its use to the extent possible.\u000aSeveral other member states also support voluntary restrictions on the use of veto in situations such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and gross human rights violations.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VWith limousine pick-ups and on-board chefs, Asia's premium airlines are investing hundreds of millions of dollars on luxury services in a bet on a rebound in business from the wealthy, even as low-cost carriers fly high with the booming middle class.\u000a\u000aAlthough business and first-class traffic has fallen significantly in the last few years as companies cut costs, carriers such as Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA), Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd are estimated to still earn about 35 to 40 percent of passenger revenue from the high-margin segment.\u000a\u000aYields per premium passenger are around four to five times higher than those for economy class, underscoring why airlines are keen to pour money on amenities that range from luxurious cabins to fine dining.\u000a\u000aAsia-Pacific airlines are the most profitable in the global aviation sector, industry data shows.\u000a\u000a"If you don't upgrade your products, you are always going to be under pressure to drop the price more significantly," Tan Pee Teck, SIA's head of product and services, told Reuters in an interview.\u000a\u000a"So, when people see the investment, see something new, fresh, there'll always be people who are going to try it, just like the way the A380 was launched."\u000a\u000aWhile low-cost carriers such as Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd and Indonesia's Lion Air have been grabbing headlines with record plane orders to feed rapid demand for travel, the battle for Asia's richer travellers has also been heating up.\u000a\u000aSingapore's flagship carrier has hired BMW Group's design unit, DesignworksUSA, to roll out new first-class seats featuring more privacy and personal stowage space.

VAn 11-month-old baby boy named Ajay has been stolen from a Hyderabad hospital, allegedly by a woman wearing a burqa. Premier children's hospital, Niloufer, installed 16 security cameras just hours before the baby was stolen. However, the police says that only 7 of the cameras were working, and were poorly placed, so the theft was not recorded.\u000aComments\u000aSign in using or\u000aLoading...\u000aTo subscribe to email notification for comments, please add your email address.\u000aEmail\u000aName Email\u000aPost to FacebookPost to Twitter\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VNew Delhi:\u000aIdentifying MBAs as threat to CAs as professionals, noted industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla on Friday asked the government to implement IFRS (international financial reporting standard) with utmost care.\u000a"CAs today face top challange from MBAs who are good at communication skills, know finance and economy better," the Chairman of Aditya Birla Group said while addressing the two-day All India Conference of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).\u000aSeeking steps to re-orient the curriculum for CA courses, Birla said that having knowledge only in accounting would not help the present day CAs to face the challenges.\u000a"MBAs have an edge over CAs in many fields as the Indian economy is much closer to the world economy now. As merger and acquisition are order of the day, CAs have big roles to play," he said.\u000aStating that the employers want new CAs to become productive from day one, Birla suggested the CAs to take leadership by virtue of their quality and have knowledge over other matters besides accounting. Birla, a chartered accountant and an MBA himself, was not happy over the rate of pass percentage of CAs.\u000a"The pass percentage during our time was 4 per cent. Now it is 17 per cent. The pass ratio should be 10 per cent," he remarked apparently stressing the need for better products. To a query from participants at the session, Birla said public analysts would misinterpret results and confuse IFRS. "IFRS should be implemented very carefully," he said.\u000a

VMumbai:  Refuting allegations by Sena-BJP leaders that his party was responsible for division of Marathi votes leading to the defeat of candidates of the saffron alliance in Maharashtra, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Friday said he had "only made Marathi voters aware of their rights."\u000a"I did not divide Marathi votes. I only made the 'Marathi manoos' aware of his rights," Raj Thackeray said addressing a party meeting at Shanmukhanand Hall here tonight.\u000aRaj Thackeray-led party is being blamed for the defeat of Sena-BJP candidates in over half-a-dozen constituencies.\u000aCongress-NCP alliance swept all the six Lok Sabha seats in Mumbai, largely due to the division of Marathi votes as MNS candidates ate into the saffron combines traditional vote bank.\u000aReferring to Shiv Sena Executive President Uddhav Thackeray's criticism of MNS's role during the elections, Raj said "let him first clarify if he voted for the BJP candidate Mahesh Jethmalani from north-central Mumbai and if Jethmalani is a 'Marathi manoos'".\u000aRefraining from commenting on the criticism by his uncle and Sena chief Bal Thackeray that 'any one who is enemy of Marathi people is also my enemy', Raj told the gathering, "I have always said that I would not say anything against Balasaheb Thackeray".\u000aExpressing confidence that MNS would do well in the assembly polls scheduled later this year, Raj said "MNS would have a say in election of next Chief Minister of Maharashtra."\u000a

VFormer Chief Justice of India, Justice JS Verma.\u000aNew Delhi:  The pressure is mounting on former Chief Justice of India (CJI) KG Balakrishnan. After Income Tax authorities probing charges of illegal wealth against his three close relatives said they have found black money, Balakrishnan's peers say they are disappointed and that he must clear his name.\u000a"Since all these close relations of Balakrishnan are those who are in the legal profession and they have become suddenly rich during his tenure as CJI, there's a needle of suspicion that is being pointed at him. He needs to clear his name; silence is no longer an option," said Justice J S Verma, former Chief Justice of India.\u000aThere are growing voices for Balakrishnan to face an inquiry and quit as head of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).\u000a"I think he should resign. I have long ago asked for a Commission of inquiry against him and his family members and his resignation," said Justice V R Krishna Iyer, former judge of the Supreme Court.\u000aAccording to sources in the Income tax department, the ex-CJI's first son-in-law, PV Sreenijan's income grew to R 7 crore from a meagre R 25,000 he declared in 2006.\u000aMJ Benny, the second son-in-law, has prime property worth crores in Ernakulam. And Balakrishnan's brother K G Bhaskaran has allegedly undervalued the land he bought.\u000aIncome tax authorities refused to say whether the ex-Chief Justice of India will be questioned.\u000a

VThane:  A bandh called by major political parties in Thane against on-going demolition of illegal structures without providing alternate accommodation to the occupants began with some persons damaging at least 12 buses in the wee hours of the morning on Thursday, police said.\u000aParties, including Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, gave call to the dawn-to-dusk shutdown against the razing of illegal buildings by Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) while demanding that alternate accommodation be provided to residents who will be displaced in the drive.\u000aUnidentified persons pelted the buses with stones at different areas in the city. At least eight out of the twelve buses damaged belonged to Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) and rest to the state government, police said.\u000aWith political parties, except Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and BJP, participating in the bandh, public transport and autos have gone off the roads, causing inconvenience to people, especially office-goers, in the morning hours.\u000aShops and other commercial establishments have also downed their shutters.\u000aMeanwhile, police detained one person while he, along with others, was allegedly deflating tyres of state-run buses under Thane Nagar police station limits.\u000aThe collapse of an illegal building in Mumbra, the suburb of Thane district of late, which had left over 70 people dead and scores injured, prompted TMC to wield a hammer on unauthorised structures.\u000aLocal MLAs--Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Jitendra Avhad (NCP), among others, have opposed the demolition drive demanding rehabilitation of residents of illegal buildings and sought regularisation of these structures.\u000aChief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, however, refused to stay the demolition of illegal constructions expressing concerns over safety of residents.\u000a"The drive to raze 57 very dangerous buildings is on (in Thane) following an impending risk of collapse. As many as 1,094 buildings there are dangerous", Mr Chavan told Legislative Assembly yesterday.\u000aHowever, Mr Shinde and Mr Avhad contended that the demolition be stopped immediately. "11 lakh out of 18 lakh population of Thane lives in slums and illegal buildings. Government cannot dislocate such a large population," they had said.\u000a

VMatthias Mueller, CEO of German car maker Volkswagen, gestures while addressing journalists after visiting an assembly line of the VW plant in Wolfsburg, central Germany, on October 21, 2015. (AFP Photo)\u000aThe head of Volkswagen's controlling family broke his silence more than two months after the emissions-cheating scandal erupted, throwing his support behind Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller and vowing to protect jobs.\u000aWolfgang Porsche, head of the family that owns a majority stake in the carmaker, delivered a message of calm to a company rocked by a series of revelations over manipulated vehicles. Addressing about 20,000 employees at Volkswagen's main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, he underscored the family's commitment to the company and said the investigation is the top priority.\u000a"I am of the rock-solid conviction that Volkswagen can weather the situation and emerge even stronger from the crisis," said Wolfgang Porsche, the grandson of the creator of the Volkswagen Beetle. "No one here is giving into panic." He was flanked by other supervisory board members who represent the reclusive clan, Louise Kiesling and Hans-Michel Piech, as well as German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel.\u000aUnion leaders had asked the family to signal their commitment to workers, who face two weeks of forced leave during the Christmas holidays as the crisis begins to affect sales. Labor chief Bernd Osterloh, who has pushed to shield staff by focusing cutbacks on Volkswagen's model portfolio, hosted the assembly, which was attended by the management board. CEO Mueller has been under fire since models made by the Porsche brand, which he previously led, were implicated in a probe by U.S. regulators.\u000aSpeaking to an audience that overflowed the factory's massive Hall 11, with several hundred employees following the meeting on screens set up outside, Wolfgang Porsche said the clan supports job security at Volkswagen and thanked the efforts made by Mueller and other managers - naming VW Brand chief Herbert Diess specifically. Still, the cousin of former Chairman Ferdinand Piech didn't make light of the challenges facing the carmaker.\u000a"No one can believe that the emissions scandal will pass by like a sudden thunderstorm," said Wolfgang Porsche, who is chairman of the family investment vehicle Porsche Automobil Holding. "Everyone at Volkswagen now needs to act decisively."\u000aThe gathering comes amid mixed news for Volkswagen. Though the company has made progress toward a simpler-than-expected recall of 8.5 million rigged diesel cars in Europe, talks with regulators are still ongoing in the United States, where hefty fines and more difficult recalls loom. Meanwhile, sales plunged in the U.S., and market share fell in Germany. The ultimate financial impact, which the company has said will total more than 8.7 billion euros ($9.24 billion), is also uncertain.\u000aStandard & Poor's downgraded Volkswagen's credit rating on Tuesday for the second time since the crisis became public. "These risks and related costs continue to expand and deepen," especially after the November revelations of misrepresented carbon-dioxide emissions in Europe, the rating company said.\u000aTo show it has enough liquidity to weather the crisis, the carmaker plans to sign a 20 billion-euro bridge loan on Friday, people familiar with the matter said. The banks, led by Citigroup and UniCredit, will each provide financing of either 1.5 billion euros or 2.5 billion euros, the people said.\u000aVolkswagen shares fell 3.3 percent to 125.80 euros at 3:42 p.m. in Frankfurt. Volkswagen has lost about 11 billion euros in market capitalization since its cheating became public Sept. 18. The lack of clear direction from the company's dominant shareholder has added to uncertainty.\u000a"The owner families have been very discreet so far amid this unprecedented crisis for the company," said Yasmina Serghini, a Paris-based analyst for Moody's. The family's stance is "an important indicator for the company's plan to accelerate reforms and improve cost efficiency."\u000aWolfgang Porsche's reticence reflects the complex relations behind the scenes at Volkswagen. The soft-spoken 72-year-old was thrown into the forefront earlier this year, when his cousin Ferdinand Piech resigned after a boardroom battle with then-CEO Martin Winterkorn. Wolfgang Porsche was the last of the company's power players to weigh in behind Winterkorn in that struggle, holding off on entering the fray until after consulting with other relatives.\u000aThe family votes in a bloc, making consensus building crucial among its 30 to 40 members. They control 52 percent of Volkswagen's voting stock through Stuttgart-based Porsche Holding. The clan tends to keep a low profile, and most live around the border of Germany and Austria.\u000aThe family's silence had exacerbated insecurity among workers as evidence grows that the emissions manipulation is starting to hurt sales. Volkswagen's U.S. deliveries dropped 25 percent in November, while the namesake brand's market share in Germany declined to 21.3 percent last month from 23.6 percent a year earlier.\u000aThe carmaker is putting production in Wolfsburg on hold for two weeks over Christmas to avoid bloated inventories. The factory is VW's largest and one of the biggest car-manufacturing locations in the world. It produced about 840,000 vehicles last year, but sustaining output could be a struggle if demand continues to slide.\u000a© 2015 Bloomberg L.P.\u000a

But, the Narendra Modi government has opposed the translocation, saying Madhya Pradesh failed to protect its tigers in Panna sanctuary and the lions from its Gir forest may meet the same fate.\u000aThe Gujarat government has also said that the court should not interfere in the matter, and leave the decision to environmental experts.\u000aThe Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh has claimed that it is equipped with all the necessary infrastructure, expertise and environment for translocating the lions to its own sanctuary.\u000a

VThe government said there were 38 active biker gangs with 4,500 members and thousands more associates.\u000aSydney:  Australia declared war on outlaw motorcycle gangs today, with the visas of more than 80 foreign nationals torn up in a crackdown on drug-dealing, extortion and gun-smuggling, which officials said was causing misery.\u000aImmigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed 81 biker gang members have had their visas cancelled or refused since mid-2014 with 27 of them already kicked out of the country. The rest are in prison or immigration detention.\u000aThe government said they were from countries including New Zealand, Britain, Bosnia, Albania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam.\u000a"Our government is very happy to declare war on outlaw motorcycle gang members," said Dutton.\u000aHe added that they were "causing misery and pain to thousands of Australians" and "this government is determined to work to make sure that we can cancel visas of people who are non-citizens who are committing crimes in our country".\u000a"I have no doubt these visa refusals or cancellations are disrupting the operations of these criminal organisations by removing key individuals from the hierarchies of the gangs along with their associates," Dutton said.\u000aMotorcycle gangs linked to organised crime are an increasing problem across Australia.\u000aThe government said there were 38 active biker gangs with 4,500 members and thousands more associates, including lawyers and accountants, with the most prominent including the Comancheros, the Rebels, Hells Angels and the Mongols.\u000aThey are accused of drug dealing, extortion, money laundering, and the distribution of firearms and explosives with turf wars often leading to brazen violence.\u000aJustice Minister Michael Keenan called them the "public face of organised crime in Australia".\u000a"We know they are heavily involved in the drug trade, they continue to exert significant influence over Australia's other black markets," he said.\u000a"They are involved in money laundering, they are involved in extortion, they're involved in gun smuggling and they are responsible for a high level of violence in the community."\u000aThe crackdown involves numerous government departments, including border force, immigration, and the tax office, working with police and the Australian Crime Commission's gangs intelligence unit.\u000a

VLondon:  A group of Qatari men, suspected of supporting the plotters of the serial attacks of 9/11, may have been preparing for a fifth suicide strike in Washington, according to the secret US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks.\u000aThe disclosure, in US diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks, has raised suspicions that the three men were preparing to be a fifth suicide squad, but aborted their plan at the last minute and instead of boarding a domestic flight to the US capital they returned to Doha, via London, the Telegraph reported here.\u000aThe US intelligence has been hunting for the Qatari men - Meshal Alhajri, Fahad Abdulla and Ali Alfehaid - who have been accused of conducting surveillance on the targets of 9/11 terror attacks, and providing "support" to the plotters.\u000aNearly 3,000 people were killed in the series of airplane attacks by terrorist Sep 11, 2001. Two of the planes hijacked by attackers crashed into the twin tower of the World Trade Centre in New York. A third plane hit Pentagon and the fourth airliner crashed in Pennsylvania.\u000aThe diplomatic documents reveal that the men flew from London to New York on a British Airways flight three weeks before the attacks and allegedly carried out surveillance at the World Trade Centre, the White House and in Virginia, the US state where the Pentagon and CIA headquarters are located.\u000aThey later flew to Los Angeles, where they stationed themselves in a hotel near the airport which the FBI has now established was paid for by a "convicted terrorist", who also bought their airline tickets.\u000aHotel staff have told investigators they saw pilot uniforms in their room along with computer print outs detailing pilot names, flight numbers and times and packages addressed to Syria, Afghanistan, Jerusalem and Jordan.\u000aOn Sep 10, 2001 they were booked on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington, but failed to board. The following day the same Boeing 757 aircraft was hijacked by five terrorists and crashed into the Pentagon.\u000aUS investigators are also hunting a fourth man, Mohamed Al Mansoori, who they say supported the alleged terrorist cell while they were in the US.\u000aThe fourth man, who is from the UAE, previously lived in Los Angeles. The US officials recommended that he is put on an international terror watch list because he "may pose a threat to aviation in the US and abroad".\u000aThe secret documents obtained by the whistleblower website were exchanged between the American embassy in Doha and the Department for Homeland Security in Washington.\u000aThe fact that the Qataris flew to and from America via London throws the spotlight back on Britain's role in the 9/11 attacks.\u000aIt is not known whether the FBI believes that the men were simply assisting the hijackers or were a fifth cell that pulled out at the final moment, the British daily said. Alternatively, they may have been planning an attack on the West Coast of America or even London which was abandoned or went wrong.\u000a

VWashington:\u000aThe Indian household and personal care segment is set to change significantly in the coming years as consumption habits, fuelled by rising disposable income and changing lifestyles, align themselves with global trends, a report says.\u000aAccording to global research firm Macquarie, it is "time to look beyond fairness cream and hair oils", as Indian consumers would start to look beyond "fairness" in personal care.\u000aThe significant change will be accentuated by the bustling middle class and the importance foreign MNCs are giving to India.\u000aL'Oreal aims for sales of around 1 billion euro by 2020 in India, Reckitt aims to make India its largest global sales contributor by 2016 and P&G plans to increase its number of product categories in India to 25 by 2015/16 from 15 in 2011.\u000aThe report further noted that the penetration of key categories with significant market sizes, like soaps, detergents, oral care, hair oil and shampoo have either reached maturity or is fast approaching it.\u000aBesides, many categories like hair oil, talcum powder, hair dye and tooth powder will face serious growth challenges in the medium to long-term as consumers upgrade or switch to substitutes like hair styling gel, deodorants, hair colour and tooth paste.\u000a"We believe these categories, although they may not have reached penetration maturity, may face headwinds amid changing consumer preferences on rising aspirations and availability of superior substitutes," the report said.\u000aAs competition from global players increase domestic players will have to "innovate" and offer new product offerings or acquire brands to enter into low penetration categories or foray into International markets.\u000aAnother growth lever for Indian players could be international markets like Africa and the less developed countries in Asia, where they could gain from penetration- driven growth as seen in India 10-15-years ago.\u000a"Companies like Dabur, Godrej Consumer, Marico and Emami have either acquired companies in these regions or have increased their own presence," Macquarie said.\u000aGoing forward, Indian consumer will have access to new categories as well as a wide range of products thanks to rapid urbanisation and rising roll out of new products by global players.\u000aIn the next 5-10 years, bath soaps are likely to be replaced by shower gel or liquid soap variants, consumers would go for liquid detergent than powder detergent and there will be growing use of hair or fabric conditioner.\u000aMoreover, the Indian consumer is likely to shift to new categories like deodorants and styling gel away from traditional categories like talcum powder and hair oils, Macquarie said.\u000a

VPreity Zinta posted a series of tweets beginning with a confession about why she became an actress\u000aActress Preity Zinta's Twitter erupted some hours ago into a furious rant against fame. The Salaam Namaste star, who hasn't had a hit movie in years, posted a series of tweets, beginning with a confession about why she became an actress and ending in a public plea to treat celebrities with sensitivity. In between, she spoke about pictures of herself being morphed, being groped in crowds, the pressure to look perfect all the time and the dating disadvantages of being famous. (Also read: Not renting out my place to pay off my debts: Preity)\u000aPreity said she was speaking on behalf of all celebrities, but it's unlikely her meltdown (15 tweets in a few minutes - if that's not a meltdown, what is?) will lead to Bollywood stars being hounded less by paparazzi, sought after less for autographs, chased less by TV cameras.\u000aHere are Preity's tweets, in the order that she posted them:\u000aWhen i got into movies i never thought i would be a big star.

VA soldier walk past a destroyed police truck near Government House, where anti-government protesters are gathered, in Bangkok on December 11, 2013\u000aBangkok:  Anti-government protesters in Thailand pinned their hopes on winning support from the powerful security forces on Thursday as they push to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and install an unelected administration.\u000aA small group of protesters scaled the walls into the grounds of Yingluck's Government House office on Thursday. They left without confronting police stationed there but said they wanted the officers to leave.\u000aProtest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy premier accused of murder during 2010 protests, has asked police and military chiefs to meet him by Thursday evening and to choose their side in the latest crisis engulfing Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.\u000aThe politically powerful army has staged or attempted 18 coups in the past 80 years, including the ousting of Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2006. It has said it does not want to get involved this time but may mediate.\u000aThe eight-year, on-and-off political conflict centres on Thaksin, a former telecommunications tycoon popular among the rural poor. The protesters view Yingluck as his puppet.\u000aThaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile, courted rural voters to win back-to-back elections in 2001 and 2005 and gain an unassailable mandate that he used to advance the interests of major companies, including his own.\u000aHe was convicted in absentia of graft in 2008 but has dismissed the charges as politically motivated.\u000aOn Monday, Yingluck was forced to call an early election for February 2 as 160,000 protesters massed around her office.\u000aThe numbers on the street have dwindled considerably since then. A Reuters reporter said most of those who scaled the Government House walls on Thursday left after razor-wire barricades in the compound were moved aside.\u000aProtest leaders said they would cut water and power to the premises if police did not withdraw. A Reuters reporter saw some power lines being cut.\u000aRiot police held their positions during the incursion without confronting the protesters.\u000a"Last night protesters tried to cut electricity at Government House and fired slingshots at police on duty," police spokesman Piya Utayo said later in a televised statement.\u000a"Some protesters and a third party have tried to escalate the situation," he said, without elaborating.\u000aA police officer on the premises, who declined to give his name because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said several small, crude explosives described as "ping pong bombs" had been thrown into the grounds on Thursday. No one was hurt.\u000aHe said police had been ordered to stay and protect the building but to avoid clashes with the protesters.\u000aINVESTMENT RISK\u000aMoody's Investors Service, a rating agency, said in a note the crisis was negative for Thailand's sovereign rating.\u000a"Prolonged protests will weigh on an already fragile growth outlook for 2014," it said.\u000a"In addition, heightened political tensions have marred investor confidence, as reflected in the accelerated decline in Thailand's official foreign exchange position since late October," it said. Foreign reserves fell to $167.5 billion on November 29 from $173.3 billion on October 25.\u000aThe protesters have rejected the early election. They want an unelected "people's council" to run Thailand and say Yingluck and her ministers should step down. She is caretaker prime minister until the election.\u000a"If a plane crashed with the whole cabinet in it and they all died, Thailand would still go on," protest leader Suthep told supporters late on Wednesday.\u000aThaksin's supporters have said they would weigh in to defend Yingluck if Suthep appeared poised to overthrow her. On Wednesday, Jatuporn Promphan, a leader of a pro-Thaksin movement, promised to mobilise crowds that would dwarf the recent anti-government protests.\u000aThaksin's "red shirt" supporters brought central Bangkok to a halt in April and May 2010 in protests aimed at forcing then Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to call early elections.\u000aThat protest was put down by the military. More than 90 people, mostly Thaksin supporters, were killed over the period.\u000aAbhisit and Suthep, a deputy prime minister to Abhisit, have been accused of murder related to those events.\u000aAbhisit was formally charged with murder at Bangkok's criminal court on Thursday and granted bail. The next hearing was set for March 24, 2014, but the case could drag on for months, or even years. Suthep did not turn up.\u000aSuthep's campaign to oust Yingluck has been strong on rhetoric but has failed to stop the government functioning.\u000aMissed deadlines for Yingluck to resign have become the norm for a protest movement that has openly courted anarchy on Bangkok streets in the hope of inducing a military coup or judicial intervention.\u000aSuthep's sometimes bewildering statements have included a call for police to arrest Yingluck for treason, an order for civil servants and security forces to report to him instead of the government and for citizen "peacekeeping forces" to take over from police.\u000a

They arrived in Amritsar today via the Attari-Wagah border and are scheduled to reach Chandigarh later in the day. They were received by the officials of Pakistani High Commission at the Attari-Wagah border.\u000aTalking to reporters, Ranjay's relatives urged the Indian government to release him so that they could take him back to Pakistan.\u000aTill Monday evening, Sanaullah continued to be "critically sick" and in "deep coma", said a medical bulletin from Chandigarh's Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). (Read) Sanaullah is being treated there.\u000aPakistan High Commissioner Salman Bashir visited Sanaullah at the hospital yesterday and said his chances of survival seemed "bleak".\u000aDemanding an impartial probe into the attack on Sanaullah, Mr Bashir said, "We want him to be repatriated to Pakistan."\u000aSanaullah, 52, was injured during a scuffle with another inmate in high-security Kot Balwal jail in Jammu and was immediately shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital there; he was later rushed to PGIMER in an air ambulance after doctors said his condition was critical.\u000aA heavy deployment of police personnel is in place around and inside the PGIMER to prevent any eventuality.\u000aThe assault came a day after the death of Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh, who was brutally attacked by six inmates in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail.\u000aSanaullah, a resident of Sialkot in Pakistan, is serving a life term after being convicted under TADA provisions following his arrest in 1999.\u000a

VHurricane Matthew is the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the US in more than 10 years\u000aAlmost 1.1 million homes and businesses were without power on Friday afternoon as Hurricane Matthew blasted Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina, electric companies said.\u000aThe outages are not as high as utilities had forecast and not expected to reach those levels because the storm has already passed most of the heavily populated southern part of Florida.\u000aOn Thursday, NextEra Energy Inc's FPL power company, the biggest in Florida, forecast Matthew could leave as many as 2.5 million homes and businesses without service, some for extended periods of time.\u000aFPL said on Friday afternoon it has already restored power to about 239,000 of the 923,000 affected by the storm, leaving about 685,000 still to be restored.\u000aMatthew, the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the United States in more than 10 years, lashed Florida with heavy rain and wind, after killing more than 800 people in Haiti as it marched north through the Caribbean.\u000aAt 2 pm EDT (1800 GMT), the centre of Matthew was located about 60 miles (95 km) southeast of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\u000aIt was packing winds of 115 miles per hour, making it a powerful Category 3 hurricane as it heads north toward the Georgia and South Carolina coasts by early on Saturday, the hurricane centre said.\u000aThe NHC forecast Matthew would weaken into a tropical storm in about two days as it turns south on a track that would take it back over the Bahamas and Florida again by the middle of next week.\u000aWith so many power outages, the state's utilities do not have to import as much natural gas as usual to generate electricity.\u000aThe amount of gas flowing into the state on the Florida Gas pipeline from Texas and Louisiana was expected to fall by about 800 million cubic feet per day on Friday from an average of 2.7 billion cubic feet per day over the past 30 days, according to Thomson Reuters data.\u000a

VA file picture taken on September 3, 1998 shows Israeli Marcus Klingberg speaking on the phone in Beersheva. (AFP)\u000aJerusalem:  The man considered the Soviet Union's most successful spy in Israel before being unmasked more than 30 years ago has died in Paris at the age of 97, his daughter said Tuesday.\u000aIsrael sentenced Marcus Klingberg to 20 years in prison in 1983 for having passed information to Moscow on its biological weapons research.\u000aHe had worked as deputy head of the Israeli Institute for Biological Research and managed to avoid detection for years before finally being found out with the help of a double agent.\u000aHis case was so sensitive that his arrest, trial and conviction were kept secret for more than a decade.\u000aHe was jailed under an alias and held in solitary confinement, while queries about his disappearance were met by claims that he was in a psychiatric hospital "somewhere in Europe".\u000a"He was a Communist who acted out of conviction and gratitude to the Red Army for having allowed him to fight the Nazis who massacred his entire family in Poland," daughter Sylvia Klingberg told AFP.\u000aKlingberg had always maintained that his motivation for spying was ideological and not financial.\u000aBorn in Warsaw into an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family, Klingberg fled Poland during the Nazi invasion in 1939 and made his way to the Soviet Union, where he studied medicine.\u000aIn 1941, after German troops entered the Soviet Union, he enlisted in the Soviet army.\u000aHe returned to Poland at the end of the war, where he discovered that his parents and brother had died in a concentration camp. He emigrated to Sweden, then to Israel shortly after the state was created in 1948.\u000aHe served in the Israeli army's health services, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel and specialising in epidemiology. He joined the top-secret biological institute, located in Nes Ziona south of Tel Aviv, in 1957.\u000aIsraeli suspicions turned toward him in 1963 and there were suggestions that his spying began long before, but he was arrested only 20 years later in 1983 with the help of a double agent codenamed Samaritan.\u000aIsrael's Shin Bet domestic security agency arranged for him to go on a foreign trip, but rather than being taken to the airport, he was taken to an isolated apartment where he was interrogated for several days before signing a confession.\u000aHe was sentenced to 20 years but freed on house detention after serving around 15. In 2003, he was authorised to live with his daughter in Paris, where he died on Monday.\u000aIn memoirs published this year and entitled "The Last Spy", Klingberg said "what upset me the most was the shame and the regret. Not for having spied for the Soviet Union, no. My sense of humiliation came from the fact that they broke me."\u000a

One can also use credit or debit cards for payment of the fee, they said.\u000a\u000a"At present, people can file online applications and appeals for information related to the DoPT only. They can also make payment of RTI fee using this platform," a DoPT official said.\u000a\u000aThe website was launched last week. Through it, RTI applications or first appeals can be filed by Indian citizens only for the main ministries or departments of central government, located at New Delhi.\u000a\u000a"The government will extend this facility to all its ministries and offices in the national capital by this month end," the official said.\u000a\u000aThe website will give an individual greater and easier access to government information, the officials said.\u000a\u000aThe Centre's flagship Right to Information Act, which was enacted in 2005, mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information. One has to pay a fee of Rs. 10 for seeking information.

VLeave travel allowance (LTA) is a common form of tax exemption given to the employees by most employers. Though it is quite simple, it often brings about a lot of questions among those claiming exemption on it.\u005cu00A0\u000a\u000aIn this article, we will answer the 10 most commonly-asked questions on LTA.\u000a\u000a1. When can we claim LTA?\u000a\u000aTax exemption on LTA can only be claimed if you have applied for leave from your company for travel and if you actual make a journey.\u000a\u000aLTA covers only the cost of travel for the trip. Hotel accommodation, food, etc. cannot be claimed for exemption.\u000a\u000a3. Whom does it cover?\u000a\u000aLTA exemption covers you and your family. A family, under LTA, includes spouse, parents, siblings, and children. The cost of other relatives cannot be claimed.\u000a\u000a4. How many times can we claim LTA?\u000a\u000aLTA can be claimed twice in a block. The blocks are decided by government. They are 2010-2013, 2014-2017 and so on.\u000a\u000a5. What type of transport does LTA cover?\u000a\u000aLTA can be claimed for travel through rail, air or any other public transport. However, you should keep in handy the proof of travel as it may be needed by your employer.\u000a\u000a7. What is the maximum limit on LTA exemption?\u000a\u000aLTA exemption is limited to the amount of LTA paid to the employee as part of the CTC. One cannot claim exemption beyond the actual LTA amount being provided.\u000a\u000aYes, both the spouses can claim the exemption on LTA from their employers. However, both of them cannot claim for the same journey.\u000a\u000aYes. In case you have only claimed LTA for one journey in a block, you can make another journey in the first year of the next block and claim it. In such a case, 3 journeys can be claimed for the block in total.\u000a\u000a10. Can LTA be claimed if the actual claiming person has not travelled?\u000a\u000aNo, LTA cannot be claimed for the family if you as a claiming person are not included in the travel.\u000a\u000aLTA exemption is available for the shortest route travelled and can be availed only for travel on working days. You can also claim LTA while filing your taxes. Proofs are not needed by the I-T department initially, but it is always better to keep them handy.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: All information in this article has been provided by InvestmentYogi.com and NDTV Profit is not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the same.

VBhubaneswar/Sambalpur:  The toll in Sunday's capsize of an overloaded motorised boat, carrying mostly picnickers, in Odisha's Hirakud reservoir rose to 28 today, while three persons were still missing.\u000aThough 11 bodies were recovered on Sunday, the others were spotted by two Odisha Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) personnel with high resolution binoculars from a state government helicopter and retrieved by scuba divers, firefighters and ODRAF men this morning, official sources said.\u000aAmong the 28 victims were 14 women, three girls, 10 men and a boy.\u000aAmong the casualties were Dinesh Tiwari and his wife Mina from Sambalpur, while their daughter was still missing.\u000aA 60-year-old man C Singh Chandel, his wife Santosh Kumari and their daughter-in-law also perished, as also three sisters Srishti, Purba and Tania, while their parents survived.\u000aAnother woman, Sushmita Jena and her minor daughter drowned.\u000aSix bodies were retrieved from the sunken boat by scuba divers, while the ODRAF men in the helicopter helped to locate others, Special Relief Commissioner P K Mohapatra said.\u000aThe search would continue till all the bodies were recovered, he said.\u000aAbout 80 persons were rescued yesterday.\u000aWhile the capacity of the boat was 100 passengers, there were 144 persons on board, sources said.\u000aBesides the picnickers, around 30 local people, some with motorcycles, were also on board the boat from Tilla ghat.\u000aRevenue and Disaster Management minister S N Patro, who visited the accident spot on the instruction of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, said that the boat capsized because of over-crowding.\u000a"The boatmen asked some of the picnickers to disembark as the boat was overloaded, but this was ignored," the minister said.\u000aMr Mohapatra said that the victims were mostly from among the Lion's Club members as local people on board swam to safety.\u000aRecounting the sequence of events in the Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs minister Kalpataru Das said that halfway through the return journey, the motor suddenly stopped creating panic among the passengers with the boat capsizing.\u000aAnother boat rushed to rescue the passengers with most of them jumping into the water.\u000aAs soon as the district administration received information about the accident, the collector, the Superintendent of Police, and the fire-brigade launched a rescue operation, Das said.\u000aThe state government has announced R 1.5 lakh ex-gratia for the family members of the dead and free treatment for the survivors.\u000aAn administrative inquiry by Sambalpur's revenue divisional commissioner has been ordered.\u000aA mass cremation of the bodies of the victims took place in Sambalpur, where most shops were closed because of the tragedy.\u000a

VRanchi:  The BJP government in Chhattisgarh is on the defensive because of an alleged sweetheart deal struck between the government and a coal firm partly owned by one of its MPs.\u000aThe report by the government's auditor finds that the state lost over 1000 crores because coal fields were allotted at low rates to the only company that bid for mining rights. Records show that this company was SMS Infrastructure. Ajay Sancheti, a Rajya Sabha MP, and a close aide of BJP president Nitin Gadkari, is a partner in this company. Mr Gadkari lost his temper in Delhi today when asked about the report. Mr Sancheti was not available for comment but sources offering his defence say that when the lease for the coal fields was allotted, Mr Gadkari was not president and Mr Sancheti was not a member of the BJP national executive, so his company did not have any political clout.\u000aThe report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which was tabled in the Chhattisgarh Assembly earlier this month, finds that the Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation (CMDC), which is owned by the government, accepted "abnormally low rates" from the only company that bid for blocks of coal fields in Bhatgaon II Extension in the central part of the state.\u000aThe report finds fault with the evaluation and acceptance of the bid. The auditor says that government officials should have either extended the deadline for receiving bids, or rebooted the process to invite fresh bids "to generate fair competition instead of justifying the low rate quoted by the lone bidder."\u000aThe President of Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation, Gauri Shankar Agarwal finds the report incorrect and says the losses it highlights are "fictitious."\u000a

VAkhilesh Yadav skipping the Stand Up India event is the second instance of his avoiding going to Noida in three months' time.\u000aNoida:  Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today again skipped Prime Minister Narendra Modi's event at this town adjoining the national capital, apparently owing to the so-called 'Noida jinx'.\u000aMr Yadav skipping the Stand Up India event is the second instance of his avoiding going to Noida in three months' time.\u000aPM Modi at a gala event at Sector-62 of Noida township launched the 'Stand up India' scheme under which banks will give loans between R 10 lakh to R 1 crore to SC/ST and women entrepreneurs.\u000aWhile Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik was present at the event, Mr Yadav was absent. His government was represented by a state cabinet minister.\u000aEarlier on December 31, 2016, Mr Yadav had not attended PM Modi's programme to lay the foundation of Delhi-Meerut Expressway.\u000aNoida jinx, as per political circles, has in the past caught up with several chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, including Veer Bahadur Singh, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Kalyan Singh and Mayawati, who lost their chairs soon after visiting Noida.\u000aThe jinx started in 1988 when former chief minister Vir Bahadur Singh lost power within days of visiting Noida that year.\u000aLater in 1997, Mayawati lost power after visiting Noida. Earlier, in 1989, N D Tiwari and 10 years later, in 1999, Kalyan Singh suffered the same fate.\u000aIn 1995, Mulayam Singh Yadav was out of power within months of his Noida visit.\u000aThe last one was Mayawati, who lost power in 2012 assembly elections after she flew down to Noida in October 2011 to inaugurate the Dalit Prerna Sthal.\u000aIn August 2012, Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated the Yamuna Expressway from Lucknow and avoided travelling to Noida. The following year, he inaugurated infrastructure projects in Gautam Buddh Nagar without visiting the city.\u000aIn 2001, the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the DND flyway from Delhi, but did not visit Noida.\u000a

When he reached the Adarsh Nagar flyover, another car intercepted him.\u000a"An unidentified man came out from the vehicle and demanded a bag containing the cash at gunpoint. When Singh refused, the man fired a shot and the bullet hit him in shoulder," said a police officer.\u000aThe accused then snatched the bag and fled the spot.\u000aSingh was rushed to a nearby hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.\u000aPolice have registered a case of attempt to murder and robbery at Adarsh Nagar police station.\u000a"It seems that an insider is involved in the attack as the accused knew that Singh was carrying cash. Investigators are screening CCTV footage of the area, and making a sketch of the accused," the officer said.\u000aPolice have also got the registration number of the vehicle in which the assailant came. An empty cartridge was also recovered from the spot, the officer added.\u000a

VVisakhapatnam:  With the induction of Nerpa, rechristened INS Chakra, into the Indian Navy on Wednesday, India is back in the elite club of nations having nuclear-powered submarines. Here are top 10 must-know facts about INS Chakra:\u000a1) INS Chakra is a Russia-made, nuclear-propelled, hunter-killer submarine. Unlike conventional submarines that India operates which need to surface to charge their batteries often - sometimes as frequently as 24 hours - INS Chakra can stay under as long as it wants. Its ability to stay underwater is restrained only by human endurance to stay underwater. Also, another problem that the submarine could face is acidity. This is because of a lack of exercise inside due to prolonged deployments.\u000a2) The Akula Class submarine will carry conventional weapons. The vessel is armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes and four 650mm torpedo tubes. It will be used to hunt and kill enemy ships.\u000a3) The INS Chakra displaces about 10,000 tons. It can do over 30 knots - more than twice the speed of conventional submarines. It can go upto a depth of 600 metres.(Your video look at the INS Chakra)\u000a4) INS Chakra is one of the quietest nuclear submarines around, with noise levels next to zero.\u000a5) It has about 80 crew members on board. The entire crew of INS Chakra has been trained in Russia for over a year. Facilities for the crew on board INS Chakra include a large recreation area, a gymnasium and a sauna as well.\u000a6) INS Chakra has been taken on lease from Russia for 10 years and would provide the Navy the opportunity to train personnel and operate such nuclear-powered vessels. In 2004, India had signed a deal with Russia worth over $900 million for leasing the submarine. INS Chakra was expected to be inducted into Indian Navy a couple of years ago, but after an on-board accident in 2008, in which several Russian sailors died, the delivery schedule was changed.\u000a7) INS Chakra formally joined the Indian Navy on Wednesday. It was commissioned by Defence Minister AK Antony at the Ship Building Complex in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. "INS Chakra will ensure security and sovereignty of the country," the minister has said. When asked if INS Chakra's induction will lead to arms race in the region, Defence Minister AK Antony told reporters, "India does not believe in arms race. We are not a confrontationist nation. We are a peaceloving nation....but, at the same time, the armed forces will be strengthened to meet any challenge."\u000a8) The induction of the nuclear-powered submarine clearly indicates India's intentions in the Indian Ocean Region and South East Asia which has recently seen increasing assertive Chinese presence in the last few months. It will also a send a strong reassuring message to south east Asian nations like Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia who want India to play a more active role in the region to counter the assertiveness of China in the area.\u000a9) The induction of the INS Chakra is likely to be followed by the induction of the indigenous INS Arihant, which will be capable of launching nuclear weapons and therefore complete the nuclear triad. INS Arihant, it is understood, is now undergoing sea trails at Vizag.\u000a10) The only other nations possessing nuclear-powered submarines are - US, Russia, UK, France and China. India is back in this elite club after over a decade. In 1988, the Indian Navy had leased a Charlie Class nuclear-powered submarine for three years till 1991. However, the expertise gathered then was lost as most officers who had trained to operate nuclear submarines have retired.\u000a

VTrinamool Congress leaders were purportedly shown accepting money in exchange for promise of favours in the sting video. (File photo)\u000aKolkata:  Nearly a month after the Narada sting operation video purportedly showing some of its leaders accepting money came to light, Trinamool Congress today said the party would conduct an internal probe into the matter and that action would be taken if anyone is found guilty.\u000a"The party will conduct an internal inquiry into the sting operation. If anyone is found guilty, action will be taken against him," Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee told reporters.\u000aThe inquiry would also look into whether leaders of other political parties had helped in conducting this sting operation, he said, alleging that Congress, CPI(M) and BJP leaders were involved in it to malign the Trinamool Congress.\u000aTrinamool had earlier dismissed the tapes as "doctored" and said the "dirty tricks departments" of its political opponents were behind the "smear campaign".\u000a"We have also many stings against opposition parties. But we don't believe in playing such dirty games," Mr Chatterjee said.\u000aHe also accused a senior CPI(M) leader of being involved with IVRCL, which had constructed the flyover that collapsed recently.\u000aCommenting on the Trinamool internal probe, state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury said, "It is due to the pressure of the people that they (TMC) have decided to institute a probe into the matter. But why are they scared of a CBI probe into it."\u000aBJP lawmaker Shamik Bhattacharya said the decision to constitute internal inquiry into the matter is "nothing but an eyewash".\u000aCPI(M) Politburo member Mohammed Salim said in a tweet that Banerjee's "drama" and subsequent attacks were conducted to distract public from Sarada Scam.\u000a"This time it is Narada. People won't be fooled this time."\u000a

VThe study showed that stress in the daily routine has particularly adverse effects on women's hearts. (Representational image)\u000aNew York:  While the number of men dying from a heart attack has been constantly decreasing during the past twenty years, the fatal risk particularly in young women has increased significantly, finds a study.\u000aThe study showed that stress in the daily routine has particularly adverse effects on women's hearts.\u000aThe multiple stress factors due to job, household and domestic care of relatives cause the stress symptoms, which may manifest organically in the heart.\u000aEvery year, 47 percent of the women and 38 percent of the men die from heart disorders, the findings revealed.\u000aSmoking, increased blood fats, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, stomach fat and lack of exercise are known risk factors that are responsible for the increased mortality rate.\u000aIn addition, gender-specific risks such as irregular menstrual cycles, early menopause, and pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia and the pill or hormone replacement therapies also worsen the heart condition in women.\u000aAlso, diabetes is often an underlying condition for women with heart diseases, which significantly increases the risk of a heart attack than in the case of men.\u000aFurther, following menopause, blood pressure generally increases and blood fats and body fat distribution are tendentially subject to adverse changes, which also increases the risk, the researchers explained.\u000a"In case of cardiovascular disorders, women have a different age distribution, other clusters of risk factors and the vascular changes in the heart also differ morphologically," said Alexandra Kautzky-Willer, professor at Medical University of Vienna in Austria.\u000aThe diagnosis and therapy for women are often more difficult. Examinations such as ECG or ergometry are less conclusive; even the heart attack blood markers in women could be improved with new, specific limit values and new gender-specific biomarkers could be established.\u000aApart from adiposity and diabetes post-traumatic stress disorders also play a considerable role in women's health.\u000aWomen need to actively incorporate periods of rest in the daily routine and should ensure sufficient physical activities to alleviate stress, the researchers suggested.\u000a

VNew Delhi: Amid growing demand for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, its Governor Raghuram Rajan met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday and discussed a range of "economic issues".\u000a"We discussed a range of economic issues," Mr Rajan told reporters after meeting with Mr Jaitley.\u000aThe meeting assumes significance amid growing calls for a rate cut by the RBI. Mr Jaitley had also pitched for lowering the cost of capital to boost growth.\u000a"Now time has come with moderate inflation to bring down the rates. If you bring down the rates, people will start borrowing from banks to pay for their flats and houses. The EMIs will go down," Mr Jaitley said in Parliament on December 10.\u000a"I am sure that the authorities who are competent to deal with it are fully seized of this view notwithstanding the balancing exercise between inflation management and growth which they have to do," he had said.\u000aThe RBI in last policy review on December 2 had kept policy rates on hold, saying a shift in stance is 'premature' but had hinted that a cut may come early next year if inflation continues to ease and government acts on the fiscal side.\u000aThe repo rate continues to be at 8 per cent while the cash reserve ratio is at 4 per cent.\u000aRetail inflation fell to 4.38 per cent in November, the lowest since the government started computing the new series of data in January 2012, as prices of food items went down further.\u000aAt the same time, industrial production saw the sharpest contraction in three years of 4.2 per cent in October, putting pressure on the RBI to cut rate to boost growth.\u000a

VKabul:  Afghan government representatives have met with a top-ranking Taliban member in his prison cell in Pakistan, an official said, suggesting a small step toward reopening stalled peace talks with the insurgent group.\u000aThe confirmation on Sunday came at the end of a bloody weekend that showed how unstable the country is, though NATO is aiming to hand over security responsibility to local forces at the end of 2014 after more than a decade of warfare against insurgents.\u000aAfghanistan's international allies hope that bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table will ease the pressure on the Afghan government as international forces draw down.\u000aAn official with the Afghan High Peace Council, which is tasked with starting talks, said the Pakistani government allowed Afghan government envoys access to Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a top-ranking Taliban official who was captured in Pakistan in 2010.\u000aHis arrest reportedly angered Afghan President Hamid Karzai because Baradar had been in secret talks with the Afghan government.\u000a"Some members from our embassy in Pakistan, they met Mullah Baradar," said Ismail Qasemyar, the council's international relations adviser. He declined to give details of the discussions or say when they took place. Qasemyar said that members of the peace council had not met with Baradar.\u000aA Pakistani intelligence official confirmed the meeting, saying Pakistani authorities arranged it at the request of the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad. The official, who was not authorised to release the information and so spoke anonymously, said Baradar met with Afghan diplomats based in Islamabad without giving further details.\u000aA spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry said they continue to push for Pakistan to release Baradar and other Taliban prisoners to speed the effort for peace talks.\u000a"The Afghan government has requested several times from Pakistan not only the release of Mullah Baradar, but of all those Taliban leaders who are in Pakistani prisons. Unfortunately so far we haven't seen any positive actions from the Pakistan side, but we are hopeful that they will take practical measures regarding this issue, as they say they will in their official statements," Janan Mosazai told reporters at a news conference earlier in the day.\u000aPakistani officials have said such demands are unrealistic.\u000aThe political machinations come as the Taliban continue to launch regular attacks on Afghan forces, their international allies and Afghan civilians.\u000aIn the latest incident on Sunday, a roadside bomb killed a district government chief and three of his bodyguards in eastern Afghanistan, officials said. The Afghan government's top official in Laghman province's Alishang district was driving to a meeting with the bodyguards when his car was blown up on the road, provincial spokesman Sarhadi Zewak said.\u000aZewak said the provincial government believes district chief Faridullah Niazi was targeted by insurgents.\u000aSuch assassinations of people allied with the government or international forces have surged this year. The U.N. reported last week that civilian deaths from such killings jumped 34 percent in the first six months of 2012 to 255 people killed, compared with 190 in the first half of 2011. The victims ranged from police to village elders who worked on programs with international forces.\u000a"Targeted killings, abduction and intimidations have created a climate of fear among officials and deter them from taking up positions and working in these areas," the U.N. report said.\u000aNo group claimed responsibility for the Sunday bombing, but it fit the pattern of Taliban assassinations of government workers. The Taliban have said that they do not consider people working with the government or supporting its programs to be civilians, saying that they are collaborators who have chosen to side with the enemy.\u000aIn the south, officials said a Taliban attack on a police checkpoint on Saturday night sparked a gunbattle that left two police officers and two Afghan civilians dead. Afghan forces were pursuing the attackers in Kandahar province's Panjwai district on Sunday, said Ahmad Jawed Faisel, a spokesman for the province.\u000aRecent days have been particularly violent in Afghanistan. On Saturday, an Afghan police officer killed 11 of his fellow officers in a remote corner of western Afghanistan. Officials said the shooter, who was killed in an ensuing gunbattle, was believed to have ties to militants.\u000aOn Friday, two Afghans shot and killed six American service members in separate attacks in Helmand province in the south - the latest in a rising number of so-called "green-on-blue" attacks in which supposed Afghan colleagues or allies have gone after international forces.\u000aThe Afghan Interior Ministry said one of the attackers was wearing a security forces uniform and the second was a "guest" at the police station where he opened fire.\u000a

VVatican City:  Pope Francis has given the Catholic church hundreds of new saints as he leads a canonisation ceremony in St Peter's Square.\u000aAmong those upon whom he bestowed the church's highest honour today are 813 Italians who were martyred in the late 15th century for refusing to convert to Islam as demanded by Turkish invaders of a southern Italian city.\u000aTwo others were canonised, a woman who helped Colombia's indigenous peoples and is now that country's first saint, and a Mexican woman who helped Catholics avoid persecution during a government crackdown of the faith in the 1920s.\u000aThe new saints were all approved for canonisation in a decree read by Pope Benedict XVI on February 11 during the same ceremony in which he announced he was resigning as pontiff.\u000a

VGuwahati:  As the overcrowded train from Bangalore chugged into Guwahati railway station early on Saturday morning, the occupants let out a spontaneous scream.\u000aMore out of relief I think than joy. They had arrived home safely.\u000aAfter all they had travelled more than 56 hours in unreserved compartments in searing heat, fleeing a perceived or real threat to their lives in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.\u000aTired, unwashed and vaguely afraid, most of the young men (there were hardly any women on this train) worked as security guards, hotel, restaurant and hotel boys. Most of them, leading a hand-to-mouth existence. But at least they were fending for themselves without burdening their poor parents back home.\u000aSome had spent over nine years in the Garden city; some just about six months. But all of them said physical and verbal abuse of some of their friends and panic calls from parents and families back home forced them to leave in haste. Most were hesitant to put a timeline for their return.\u000aSome others were defiant.\u000aA young security guard, Bikash who has spent over three years in Bangalore told me at the railway station: "We are Hindustanis, we have the right to stay to anywhere in the country. I will go back when situation is better."\u000aHe won't specify what his definition of "better" is.\u000aBikash and his friends who alighted from the train on Saturday morning with just one bag each, also could not put a finger on why, who and where the rumours of attacks on people from north-east, particularly Assam started. Some said they were stopped on the road and asked: "Are you from Assam?" That was enough to spark fear. Bikash and friends had been watching the ethnic clashes in Kokrajhar on Assamese satellite channels and had heard rumours that there would be a backlash of that violence.\u000aOthers heard from friends that an SMS had warned of "something" terribly wrong happening after Id on August 20. This was immediately after the Mumbai riots last Saturday.\u000aStaying in a closed group, hardly interacting with the rest of the cosmopolitan society in Bangalore or Hyderabad, the fear felt by a couple of these boys was immediately transmitted to the rest of the group, inducing large-scale panic.\u000aAbsence of any social links with local residents because of the tendency to live in close-knit, cloistered groups, further aggravated the problem. As I wrote in Outlook in May this year in a different context: "Clan and ethnic loyalties often take precedence over regional identities. A larger community often discriminates against a smaller ethnic group. A surfeit of student groups and associations formed on tribal lines in most big cities bears testimony to this reality. All of them prefer to keep to themselves, trying to find protection in numbers." With no one to counsel them or offer assurance, these boys started landing up at the railway station on the evening of August 15.\u000aAs images of the huge rush started flashing on local channels in Karnataka, Assamese channels picked up the news, feeding the frenzy back home, forcing anxious parents to call up their children in panic. As Abhijit Miri told me: "My parents saw reports on TV and said come back. Money is not important." When Abhijit said he was hopping on to the next available train, a couple of his his friends too decided to leave!\u000aNo amount of assurance by the government and allurement by the employers could keep these professional back in Bangalore or Hyderabad. All of them simply wanted to go back home even if for a few days.\u000aAs national channels and newspapers picked up the story, the exodus got radiated to other cities too. In Pune, attacks on North-Easterners further added to the fear.\u000aA clueless government initially blamed the social media and offending SMSes or MMSes for the panic but later realised that the establishment was not reacting fast enough.\u000aIt took close to 48 hours for the Central government as well as state governments in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra to take a grip on the situation.\u000aOn Saturday afternoon, when I spoke with Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, he said: "Our desire is that they go back. We will arrange for special trains from here to southern states whenever they want." (Watch: Tarun Gogoi appeals them to go back)\u000aMr Gogoi said he had spoken to all Chief Ministers, the Home Minister and the Prime Minister too. The government meanwhile has promised to track down those who triggered panic in the North-Eastern community in Bangalore and other cities by sending out threatening and incendiary messages.\u000aAs tempers cool down and the huge rush of returning migrants gets reduced to a trickle, a calmer rethink will prevail among all stake holders.\u000aAll those who have worked, studied and lived in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune or Chennai, they will certainly like to go back. The service industry and employers in other sectors are heavily dependent on the north-easterners and would like them back at work as early as possible. The professionals would also like to restart their livelihood.\u000aIt is therefore incumbent on each one of us to ensure that life goes back to normal by ensuring that rumour mongers are meted out exemplary punishment and at the same time genuinely assuring North-East migrants that they are an integral part of the idea that is India.\u000aWe owe this to ourselves.\u000a

VTelecom regulator Trai has extended the last date to December 22 for receiving comments on interconnect charges which one operator pays to other for using its network to complete calls.\u000a\u000aEarlier, while releasing the consultation paper on Interconnect Usage Charges' (IUC), Trai had asked the stakeholders to send their comments by December 11 and counter-comments by December 18.\u000a\u000a"On the request of some service providers, the Authority has decided to extend the date for submission of written comments and counter-comments till December 22 and December 29, 2014 respectively," Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.\u000a\u000aTrai had specified the IUC in 2003 and subsequently the charges have been revised in 2006 and 2009.\u000a\u000aThe prevailing IUC regime was notified in 2009.\u000a\u000aAt present, termination charge for all local and national long-distance mobile calls is Rs. 0.20 per minute, which means a telecom company pays Rs. 0.20 per minute to other company on whose network call ends.\u000a\u000aThe termination charge for incoming international long distance calls is Rs. 0.40 per minute.

VVideogame publisher Electronic Arts has begun laying off staff at its Montreal game studio in its latest round of jobs cuts, less than a month after former Chief Executive John Riccitiello abruptly resigned.\u000a\u000aThe company, known for its "FIFA" and "Sims" games, declined to divulge the number of jobs affected, or how many employees it has in Montreal, where it has developed console games like "Army of Two".\u000a\u000a"EA is sharpening its focus to provide games for new platforms and mobile. In some cases, this involves reducing team sizes as we evolve into a more efficient organization," the Redwood City, California-based company said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe Montreal studio, which includes a team that makes mobile games, is not closing, a spokesman said. He declined to say which teams within the studio had been affected by the job cuts.\u000a\u000aThe layoffs come shortly after John Riccitiello stepped down as CEO on March 30, after taking responsibility for missed operational targets.\u000a\u000aFormer CEO and Chairman Larry Probst has been appointed executive chairman as the company begins its search for the next CEO.\u000a\u000aEA and rivals like Activision Blizzard Inc have seen growth fall off sharply as more gamers flock to free games on social networks or on mobile devices. The biggest traditional games publishers have tried to buy startups, reorganize existing studios and invest in mobile platforms but face intense competition from entrenched players like Rovio or Zynga Inc.\u000a\u000aEA has been reorganizing studios to embrace new game platforms and adapt to consumer behavior. Last year, EA's PopCap unit, which makes social and mobile games, laid off 50 of about 380 staff members in its Seattle and Vancouver studios to focus on free-to-play social and mobile games.\u000a\u000aThe game publisher is also preparing to adopt the next-generation video game console technology in its games. Consumers are holding back from buying hardware and software as they wait for next-generation versions of Sony Corp's PlayStation and Microsoft Corp's Xbox, expected later this year.\u000a\u000aShares of EA edged higher in extended trading after closing at $17.63 on Nasdaq.

VTonight on The Buck Stops Here:\u000a'Fear among Christians can hit armed forces': Ex-Navy chief echoes Julio Ribeiro\u000aRenowned economist Professor Jagdish Bhagwati's interview to NDTV has created headlines and divided opinion on the attack on Christians. On The Buck Stops Here, a huge debate between Mohandas Pai and Admiral (Retd) Sushil Kumar. The former navy chief says the fear among minorities could percolate into the armed forces. Mohandas Pai rubbishes the claim.\u000aDeepika Padukone's #MyChoice video: Brave or banal?\u000aOn The Buck Stops Here, we debate: Is #MyChoice video starring Deepika Padukone elitist or is it about empowerment? Is the moral police at work criticising the "sex outside of marriage" line in the video? And why is Deepika Padukone being targeted for the message the video is trying to convey?\u000a

VPeoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti\u000aSrinagar:  PDP today expelled its district president for Leh Tashi Gyalson from the basic membership of the party for signing a memorandum demanding Union Territory status for Ladakh, saying that under no circumstances will it endorse any move aimed at dividing the state.\u000aThe head of PDP's Disciplinary Committee Abdul Rehman Veeri expelled Gyalson for violating the party's whip, a party spokesman said in a statement.\u000a"Gyalson signed the memorandum demanding Union Territory status for Ladakh which is against the policies of PDP," he said.\u000aThe spokesman said PDP believes in unity and any move aimed at dividing the state on regional or religious lines will only be an unfortunate development, and under no circumstances will the party endorse any such divisive move.\u000a"People of different faiths, ethnicity and languages live cordially in J&K since ages. PDP believes in taking everyone together to find a lasting solution to our problems," he said.\u000aThe spokesman said people are still suffering the fallout of the partition and any further division of Jammu and Kashmir will only add to the problems of the state and region.\u000a

VTokyo:\u000aAsian shares edged up and the dollar held slim gains amid expectations for an upbeat US payrolls report later in the session, which could show the economy shaking off a severe winter.The Asian markets drew scant impetus from Wall Street, which closed little changed ahead of the jobs report. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent. China's markets are closed on Friday.\u000aMarket focus is now on whether the April jobs report, which a Reuters survey of economists forecast to show US employment rising at its fastest clip in five months, would be strong enough to decisively tilt sentiment towards the US economy.\u000aUS economic indicators have been a mixed batch so far this week, with first quarter GDP and construction spending falling short of expectations while consumer spending recorded its largest gain in more than 4-1/2 years in March and factory activity accelerated last month.\u000aUS Treasuries rallied on Thursday, focusing more on weaker data that helped build expectations the Fed would be kept from raising short-term rates before second-half 2015 and perhaps even lead it to pause stimulus tapering.\u000aThe 10-year US Treasury note yield fell to a two-month low on Thursday, removing support for the dollar.\u000a"After the weak GDP print, a strong non-farm payroll is unlikely to alter Fed rhetoric - therefore risk (equities and emerging markets) should rally, specifically in countries tied to the United States via trade," currency strategists at CitiFX wrote in a note to clients.\u000aTokyo's Nikkei stock average bucked the trend, slipping 0.2 per cent.\u000aConcerns about slowing growth has depressed the Nikkei this year, which has underperformed many major markets after a record-breaking rally of over 50 per cent in 2013 thanks to Tokyo's aggressive stimulus policies.\u000aDwindling expectations of fresh stimulus by the Bank of Japan have also weighed on sentiment, as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly insisted in recent weeks that the economy can weather the impact of the sales tax hike that took effect last month.\u000a"The BOJ's easing looks so distant now. I would think it's unlikely to take place this year," said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.\u000aThe dollar stood little changed at 102.38 yen after posting a modest gain against the Japanese currency on Thursday. The euro was also flat, trading at $1.3860 .\u000aSterling was at $1.6884 , hovering near a five-year high of $1.6921 hit on Thursday after robust manufacturing data bolstered optimism in the British economy.\u000aIn the commodities markets, oil remained top-heavy after slipping Thursday on disappointing Chinese manufacturing activity and data showing US crude stocks rose last week to their highest level since 1982.\u000aUS crude futures stood little changed at $99.47 a barrel.\u000aLondon copper dipped and was on track to log its biggest weekly loss in seven weeks, weighed by the Fed's decision this week to continue tapering of its stimulus, which had provided the commodity markets with liquidity.\u000aThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged down 0.3 per cent to $6,624.75 a tonne. Copper prices have dropped about 1.9 per cent this week\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VGilmore, a senior director at NBC Sports, is assigned to create viral videos for the Olympics AP\u000aStamford:  At 3:30 a.m. on the day before the Olympics started, Brian Gilmore was glancing at the giant television screen that dominates a workroom at NBC Sports Group's headquarters when something caught his eye.\u000aA luge competitor from India, Shiva Keshavan, had fallen off his sled during a training run and, somewhat miraculously, had hoisted himself back on while speeding down the course.\u000aGilmore shouted across the room for someone to capture the video and asked colleagues whether they had ever seen anything like it. No one had. Gilmore posted the video on NBC's Olympics website and within a few days, more than 1.5 million people watched it.\u000aGilmore, a senior director at NBC Sports, is assigned to create viral videos for the Olympics. His job is to find moments - wacky, heartbreaking or heartwarming - to break out and post in the hope of generating the most online traffic possible.\u000a"Our job is to find things that can resonate," said Gilmore, who works with some four dozen people responsible for monitoring streams of every competition in Sochi and breaking out clips for highlight packages.\u000aEach person sits behind multiple computer screens. Clocks on either side of a 159-inch TV screen on the wall tell the time in Sochi and Stamford.\u000aSomewhat improbably, Keshavan's clip was the NBC Olympics site's most popular clip for several days until Olga Graf blew by him. The Russian speedskater was captured by cameras after a race zipping down her Lycra uniform front to cool off, only to quickly zip it back up when she realized she had nothing on underneath. The clip was G-rated but still, more than 2.5 million people had to see for themselves.\u000aOther popular clips include an interview with tearful American skier Hannah Kearney, overcome at the realization her career was ending with a bronze instead of gold medal; skier Todd Lodwick "photo-bombing" NBC's Randy Moss as Moss reported on him; luger Kate Hansen psyching herself for competition with a dance routine; and a cross-country skier who pressed on despite a broken ski. The Russian police choir's rendition of "Get Lucky" before the opening ceremony earned 1.6 million clicks.\u000aGilmore's job requires a different mindset than television producers; the "Get Lucky" performance didn't make it on NBC television until it became a sensation online. It's harder to describe a moment than it is to recognize one.\u000a"You know it when you see it," he said. "You're looking for emotion. You're looking for things you've never seen before."\u000aCrashes, wipeouts, spills - whatever you call them - are popular. But you have to be careful. "You don't like to celebrate injury," Gilmore said.\u000aA key for Gilmore is being surrounded by an experienced team, with as many people as possible who have worked the Olympics before and understand the pace.\u000aThe clips become viral strictly within NBC's universe. The company keeps them for NBC's own websites and doesn't spread them around the Web. Success in highlighting a video that many people want to see means success financially. NBC is seeking as much traffic for its digital platform as possible, and each time these videos are opened, an advertisement plays.\u000aClips deemed good enough are given front-page attention on the NBC Olympics websites. "Not everything can make the prime-time show, but we can put what we want up there," he said.\u000a

VGhaziabad:  The hearing in Aarushi-Hemraj double murder case will take place in a special CBI court here tomorrow during which the agency will put forth its opinion on the protest petition filed by the slain teenager's family against its closure report.\u000aThe CBI is expected to stand by its closure report in the case and is likely to challenge the petition filed by Aarushi's father Rajesh Talwar, official sources said. They, however, said the Court can take cognisance of the closure report and issue orders to the agency based on the same.\u000aMeanwhile, the local police have planned to put in place an elaborate security in the court premises following an attack on Aarushi's father during the last hearing on January 25.\u000aBesides deployment of personnel from the local police station and the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) security would also be provided to the Talwar family.\u000aUtsav Sharma, a resident of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, who had earlier stabbed former Haryana DGP SPS Rathore, a convict in the Ruchika molestation case, had attacked Talwar with a cleaver.\u000aThe incident had sent shockwaves among the district police and those in the court premises.\u000aThough the Court was scheduled to hear the matter on the same day post lunch, the attack forced the court to defer the matter till February 8.\u000aThe parents in the petition have alleged that there were "deliberate lapses" in the investigation besides noticeable non-mentioning of material pieces of evidence.\u000aThey have also pleaded that further investigation should be ordered into the case "so that the culprits involved in this heinous crime are apprehended, and investigated against and brought to trial."\u000aIn the petition, the Talwars have given the sequence of events during the night of May 15 when the teenager was murdered and during subsequent days as per their memory.\u000a"The Petitioner submits that the conclusions arrived at by the Central Bureau of Investigation on several material facts, issues and circumstances are manifestly erroneous and are based on presumptions, conjectures and surmises, not substantiated or supported by true and actual facts.\u000a"There are deliberate lapses noticed by the Petitioner, besides noticeable non-mentioning of material pieces of evidence collected during the investigation of the case, which had lead to the filing of this petition," the petition said.\u000a14-year-old Aarushi was found murdered at her residence in 2008. The body of their domestic help Hemraj was found on the terrace of the house later.\u000a

VA court in Mannheim ruled on Wednesday that Microsoft infringed Motorola Mobility's patents and ordered Microsoft to remove its popular Xbox 360 gaming consoles and Windows 7 operating system software from the German market.\u000a\u000aHowever, Microsoft said that the ruling did not mean that its products would be taken off retailers' shelves because a U.S. district court in Seattle has granted Microsoft a preliminary injunction against Motorola to prevent the phone maker from enforcing any German court order.\u000a\u000a"Motorola is prohibited from acting on today's decision, and our business in Germany will continue as usual while we appeal this decision and pursue the fundamental issue of Motorola's broken promise," Microsoft said in a response to the ruling.\u000a\u000aThe Mannheim case is related to the larger smartphone patent war being fought by Apple, Microsoft and mobile phone makers who use Google's Android software such as Samsung.\u000a\u000aGerman judge Holger Kircher said on Wednesday Microsoft breached an agreement with Motorola Mobility, which is in the process of being bought by Google, in using certain video-compression software in products including Windows 7 and Xbox.\u000a\u000aBut following complaints by Microsoft and Apple the EU competition authorities have opened two investigations into whether Motorola has been over-charging for the use of its patents in their rival products.\u000a\u000aTechnology companies have invested billions of dollars in buying up patent portfolios that they can use defensively or offensively against rivals and spent still more money litigating in the United States and Europe.\u000a\u000aLast week a judge for the U.S. International Trade Commission also said Microsoft infringed Motorola Mobility's patents for technology used in the Xbox's wireless internet connection and video compression functions.\u000a\u000aHowever, Wednesday's ruling is also expected to have little immediate impact for Microsoft's wider European distribution operations as it has already moved its regional software distribution centre to the Netherlands from Germany in anticipation of adverse judgments in the patent trial.\u000a\u000aGermany has in recent months become a major battleground in the global patent war between makers of mobile phones, tablet computer devices and their operating software as court actions there have proved to be relatively cheap and speedier than in other jurisdictions.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year German courts forced Korea's Samsung Electronics to stop selling its Galaxy 10.1 tablet in the country and told Apple Inc to de-activate "push" notification features for some customers in Germany.

VThe deadly California shooting that killed 14 and injured 17 was a terrorist attack conducted by perpetrators inspired by ISIS and possibly linked to Al-Qaeda. (File Photo - US Special Forces)\u000aHoover:  Anita Jefferson didn't know much about San Bernardino, California, before the apparent terror attack there. The West Coast town is nearly the exact same size as her hometown of Birmingham and hardly a high-profile target like New York or Paris.\u000aNow, Jefferson finds herself worried about the possibility of an attack at a location like the suburban shopping mall where she works at a food kiosk for the Christmas shopping season. A place that's public but, unlike stadiums and other venues, has relatively lax security.\u000a"You'd think they'd go to a larger place, but a smaller place may be easier," said Jefferson, 62.\u000aThe FBI announced Friday that it was investigating the mass shooting that left 14 people dead at a Christmas party as an act of terrorism. The couple who carried out the shooting, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, died in a gunbattle with police.\u000aIf there could be a terror attack at a social services center in San Bernardino, why not suburban Alabama, or downtown Louisville, Kentucky? The bloody massacre made it all too obvious for some Americans that big cities with marquee names aren't the only potential targets.\u000a"I can honestly say I don't feel as safe," said Tim Harrington, 50, of Jacksonville, Florida, while touring a museum in Louisville.\u000aThere is plenty of security at the suburban Birmingham mall - "and they're awesome," said Lindsay Alexander, 18, who also works there and feels safe. But her comfort level isn't what it was a few days ago.\u000a"It could happen here," said Alexander. "They could just pick something random."\u000aPsychology professor Marjorie Sanfilippo doesn't believe people will change their behavior because of the San Bernardino shootings.\u000a"People are very resilient tend to get back to their regular lives," said Sanfilippo, who teaches at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida.\u000aBut, she cautioned, that could change if there were more random attacks in public places, such as coffee shops.\u000a"That's when I think we would see fear," said Sanfilippo.\u000aResidents in Lincoln, Nebraska - which experienced its first homicide of 2015 just last month - said the attacks hadn't affected their sense of security.\u000a"If they're looking for a mass killing, they're going to go to places with more people," said Nate Jurgensmeier, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. "They're not going to kill nearly as many people if they crash into a dorm building or a building in downtown Lincoln."\u000aMatt Eckhardt, 30, of Lincoln also considers his city safe.\u000a"If you were living in New York, I think your perspective would be a lot different than ours," Eckhardt said.\u000aYet in Louisville, Nautica Delacruz of Los Angeles said the attacks in her home state had shaken her sense of security.\u000a "You kind of just want to go to work and home, or pick up your kid and go straight home," she said. "You really don't want to go anywhere. You kind of feel like you're violated in a sense of your freedom, in a way. You don't feel safe going anywhere anymore."\u000aAt the Louisville museum, Harrington said the threat of terror already is making him re-evaluate his safety. He has cut back on international travel for business, and he said he doesn't feel as safe as he once did in office buildings.\u000aHarrington said he isn't changing domestic travel plans, and he feels secure going to NFL games in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida.\u000a"But definitely, I think if I'm in a crowd of people outside where I don't see policemen, I'd kind of be a little bit more fearful," he said.\u000aStanding in the middle of the Alabama mall crowded with holiday shoppers, a brightly lit carousel twirling in the food court, Jefferson said she is doing her best not to worry, but: "It's in the back of your head."\u000a

VGold is an integral part of our lives in India. On the global front, India is the largest consumer of gold. India accounts for more than 30 per cent of the global gold market. However, the domestic production of gold in India is minimal. India meets the high demand of gold from its domestic consumers by importing it.\u000a\u000aThough the universal acceptance, liquidity and safe haven against economic or political turmoil makes gold lucrative, it does not add much of a value to the economy.\u000a\u000aMost of the gold bought by us Indians is used for consumption purpose in the form of jewellery. Even from the investment perspective, majority of the Indians still prefer the traditional way of holding it in the physical form. Gold ETFs, which were first introduced in India in 2007, witnessed slow growth in the initial years. Over the past couple of years, investments in gold ETFs gained momentum.\u000a\u000aHowever, as per the statistics of Gold Council, jewellery accounts for nearly 75 per cent of the gold demand in India. When we compare this consumption rate with the global scenario, even the second largest importer of gold, i.e., China lags by more than 30 per cent in terms of consumer demand. If we compare these demand levels against the size of economy of major nations, India's GDP is much lower than that of China or the US. The high consumption rate of gold among Indians is unproductive for the Indian economy.\u000a\u000aThe first major problem the Indian economy faces with this high gold consumption rates is the increasing current account deficit (CAD). India has to pay for its gold imports using its foreign exchange reserves.\u000a\u000aForeign exchange reserves hold a key especially among the developing countries, which have to import and use the industrial metals. Higher consumption of industrial commodities supports industrial production. The goods produced by consuming such commodities can be exported and the revenues can be used to fund the current account deficit. Even during its higher prices, the demand for gold did not go down. The oil imports are a huge burden on India's balance of payments. But oil consumption is something which India cannot reduce keeping its industrial usage in perspective. High gold imports and weak rupee have been the biggest stress points when it comes to narrowing the current account deficit.\u000a\u000aMisallocated capital is the second problem faced by the Indian economy due to its gold rush. Keeping the consumption aside, physical gold (mostly jewellery) is also considered as an investment among Indians.\u000a\u000aHowever, it is an investment that does not add much value to the productive capacity of the economy. Investments in the physical form of gold are either stored in bank lockers or get exchanged for making jewellery. It seldom gets traded for money. Imagine the same amount being invested in the capital markets. It allows the companies to raise capital in the form of debt or equity and expand their business. It can make a huge difference to the productive capacity of the economy. It not only just adds to the physical goods produced, it also has a potential to improve employment in a vastly populated country like India.\u000a\u000aIt is a given fact that over the last decade, gold has given returns which no other asset class has been able to match. However, the demand for gold among Indians has always been price independent. Gold is a traditional investment strategy Indians follow. The effect of high prices has been minimal on the volume of gold imported. The lower prices may increase the demand in the coming days. It is the economies of the US and Europe that play a major role in determining the price movements of gold. By importing gold for our consumption, we Indians are investing in the international markets and helping their economies.\u000a\u000aOver the last few years, the Indian markets are supported majorly by the foreign inflows. Participation of Indian domestic investors becomes all the more important for the Indian markets to prosper. Even for the transition of India from a developing market to developed market, it is important that the domestic investors stay invested in the capital markets.\u000a\u000aThe lack of alternative investments is one of the reasons attributed for Indian investors favoring gold over domestic capital markets. More investors in the capital markets will also drive more investment options in the domestic markets. More than looking at it as an alternative investment, we invest in gold and real estate because we understand it easily.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the author.

VBangalore:  Karnataka government will decide its next step on the Supreme Court order, striking down its decision to impose Kannada as a medium of instruction in primary education, after studying the verdict, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said in Bangalore today.\u000a"I have got to know about Supreme Court order; I'm yet to get details about it, once I have details we will decide on further course of action," he told reporters.\u000aHe was reacting to the Supreme Court judgement that government cannot impose mother tongue on linguistic minority for imparting primary education.\u000aMr Siddaramaiah said "Once we have order copy with us, we will discuss it and see what is to be done legally."\u000aA five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice R M Lodha, today said, "State has no power to compel linguistic minority to impart primary education by compulsorily imposing regional language."\u000aThe bench, also comprising Justices A K Patnaik, S J Mukhopadhaya, Dipak Misra and F M I Kalifulla, was hearing the issue which had come before the Apex Court as two Karnataka Government Orders of 1994 making mother tongue or regional language compulsory for imparting education from class I to IV, had come under challenge.\u000aFormer Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council D V Sadananda Gowda said, "I urge the CM to call a meeting of political leaders, legal and language experts to discuss about this Supreme Court verdict."\u000a"We will together have to find out a solution to this in order to safeguard our culture and its values," he added.\u000aSeveral pro-Kannada organisations have urged the government to file a review petition in this regard.\u000a

VRSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, BJP president Amit Shah and other leaders were present in the meeting which began yesterday.\u000aNagaur:  After asking the government to check "subversive" elements indulging in "anti-national" activities in universities like JNU, the RSS today called for value-based and nationalistic education in an atmosphere of equal opportunity.\u000aAsserting that the private sector was becoming aggressive in the education field, the RSS also pitched for a stronger regulatory body, possibly decentralised to ensure quality education for all.\u000aThe RSS in the annual meeting of its highest decision-making body -- Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) -- passed two resolutions on education and medical and healthcare, while calling upon the state governments to make efforts to make these two sectors accessible to all the people in the country.\u000aA resolution said the ABPS is of the opinion that every child should get "value-based, nationalistic, employment-oriented and skill-based education in an atmosphere of equal opportunity".\u000aYesterday the RSS asked the central and state governments to "deal strictly with anti-national and anti-social forces and ensure the sanctity and cultural atmosphere by not allowing our educational institutions to become centres of political activities".\u000a"Privatisation and commercialisation of education has created difficulties for the common man to get their wards quality education. Quality education should be available to all at an affordable price," said Anirudh Deshpande, Akhil Bhartiya Sampark Prakukh of the RSS at the press briefing on the second day of the three-day ABPS meet.\u000aHe said a strong regulatory body was needed in the country to take care of it and to "control the private institutions".\u000a"Though we have a regulatory body, but we need to strengthen it and if required, it should be decentralised."\u000aMr Deshpande claimed with the course of time, governments are also withdrawing from the sector of education and budget allocation is also reducing.\u000a"Governments are withdrawing and the private sector is becoming aggressive which has made the situation problematic for the student. The government should increase budget allocation for education," he said.\u000a"The government should strengthen the autonomous self-regulatory mechanism for the education institutions in terms of their quality, infrastructure, service conditions, fees and standards so that its policies are implemented in transparent manner.\u000a"It is utmost essential to ensure proper training, appropriate salaries and strengthen the dutifulness of the teachers to enhance their standard, both in state-run and private schools," the resolution said.\u000a"Quality medical facilities should be available to all at affordable prices...There is also need to spread the medical education, inclusion of other branches like Ayurveda and Unani is also required," Mr Deshpande said.\u000aIn the resolution, the RSS has appreciated free medicines schemes initiated in some states.\u000a"The schemes of free distribution of medicines started in states in last few years and the proposal made for 3,000 generic medicines centres by the central government in the recent budget are welcome moves.\u000aThe ABPS also called upon the country's industry groups, voluntary and social organisations and charitable trusts to further come forward to make facilities available for people.\u000aRSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, BJP president Amit Shah and other leaders were present in the meeting which began yesterday.\u000a

VApple might be preparing a significant overhaul to its Apple TV streaming device. The set-top box, which has till now been regularly described as a "hobby" within the company, looks like it's already being taken a lot more seriously now. The company's online store has been reorganised to give Apple TV its own top-level category alongside the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac product lines. It was previously consigned to the accessories section of the iPod line, but now it has its own accessories section.\u000aA report by 9to5mac suggests that the move has come in advance of a redesign of the product itself. Apple could be readying a new version of the device that supports third-party apps and games, much like its current lineup of portable iOS devices. It is unknown whether Apple will also release a new kind of controller for the new capabilities, use some form of gesture recognition, or rely on users' existing iPhones, iPods and iPads to provide input.\u000a9to5mac also speculates that the refreshed device will integrate a Wi-Fi router to ensure that users experience smooth content delivery and video playback. There is no indication of the new device's pricing and whether there will be multiple models.\u000aApple had been widely expected to launch a line of television sets with a dramatically reimagined interface for media discovery and playback in 2012 or 2013, but this never came to pass. Analysts who had predicted such a launch later speculated that resistance from American content providers and cable TV operators had led to the products being scrapped. The new Apple TV could be a reimagining of those capabilities in an external box rather than built into a TV set.\u000aApple TV first debuted in 2006 as an accessory that allowed users to play their iTunes music, movies and TV shows on a high-definition TV set, but required to be synced with a computer. Although millions of units have been sold, the device has always been considered a niche product.\u000aIn 2010, Apple reinvented its hobby device by eliminating the hard drive, shrinking it to a quarter its original size, and emphasising its function as an online HD media streaming device. Since then, a number of third-party content services have been added, including Netflix, Hulu Plus, Disney, Discovery, Bloomberg, and a variety of sports networks. The content is largely specific to the United States, which has been another factor limiting Apple TV's popularity. Since then, a minor revision has been released, which ups the video output to 1080p.\u000aIn addition to online content, Apple TVs can be used to receive streaming video from Macs and iOS devices, and can play audio and video content as well as photo slideshows stored on a home PC or other networked device.\u000aOver the course of its life, several people have attempted to hack or otherwise modify the AppleTV's capabilities. The devices run on a modified version of iOS, leading many to attempt to run third-party apps and software on them. The time seems right for Apple TV to take the next step towards becoming more than just a set-top box.\u000a

VInter-ministerial panel Telecom Commission (TC) met on Monday to discuss the next round of spectrum auction including finalisation of the base price.\u000a\u000aHowever, it could not be ascertained if any decision regarding the matter was taken.\u000a\u000a"The commission discussed the Trai recommendations on the valuation and reserve price of spectrum to be auctioned," a source in Department of Telecom (DoT) said.\u000a\u000aSectoral regulator Trai has submitted its revised recommendations on the pricing of 800MHz, 900MHz and 1800MHz bands.\u000a\u000aThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has reiterated its recommendations for 900MHz and 1800MHz bands while it has increased the base price by 15 percent for 800MHz band.\u000a\u000aThe DoT had sent back Trai's recommendations on 800MHz, 900MHz and 1800MHz bands for reconsidering some points.\u000a\u000aThe next round of spectrum auction is proposed to be held in February and the government is estimated to garner at least Rs. 9,355 crores from sale of radiowaves.\u000a\u000aMost of the spectrum which is proposed to be put up for sale is being used by Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications across various parts of the country.\u000a\u000aThese companies will need to buy back radiowaves to continue their operations in areas where their licences are expiring in 2015-16.\u000a\u000aTrai has also released a consultation paper on pricing of 2100MHz band, used for offering 3G services, as the government plans to auction this band along with 800MHz, 900MHz and 1800MHz in February.\u000a\u000aTelecom companies as well as the regulator have been of the view that the auction should take place only when adequate spectrum is made available, and the bidding should be held simultaneously for both the services - 2G and 3G.

VPresident Barack Obama, hoping to spur U.S. innovation in the explosive field of mobile communications, on Wednesday ordered all major federal agencies to make many more of their services available on mobile phones within the next year.\u000a\u000a"Americans deserve a government that works for them anytime, anywhere, and on any device," Obama said in a statement.\u000a\u000aHis administration is eager to hasten government adoption of new technology since showing itself to be highly tech-savvy after running a 2008 election campaign that was widely praised for the innovative way it used the Internet and social media.\u000a\u000aAnalysts welcomed the move, but voiced scepticism it could be effective unless Obama also freed up more government broadband spectrum to the private sector.\u000a\u000a"American citizens won't be better served by government technology and digital services unless more government spectrum is made available to enable these technologies and services," said Mobile Future Chairman Jonathan Spalter.\u000a\u000aHis coalition includes AT&T Inc, Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile, Cisco Systems Inc and Qualcomm Inc.\u000a\u000aThe presidential order tells each agency to make at least two services relied upon by the public available on mobile phones within 12 months.\u000a\u000aWhat this means in practical terms is a massive expansion in public access to government data, from healthcare and education to energy and public safety, which the administration hopes will boost jobs by encouraging innovation.\u000a\u000aBut public interest group Free Press said what was really needed from Obama were communication laws and competition policies that make broadband more accessible to everyone.\u000a\u000a"Government's most important role in this space is not as a content creator," said Free Press policy director Matt Wood.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration also released a new digital strategy on Wednesday that it said would drive a more efficient and coordinated delivery of federal services on mobile devices.\u000a\u000aThis will require agencies to set up websites to provide online resources for outside developers, and make government information open and machine-readable by default.\u000a\u000a"The initiatives we're launching today will make government data resources even more accessible to the public and to entrepreneurs who can turn these data into services," said U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park.\u000a\u000aAnalysts said Obama's directive was a logical step to move government further into the digital world.\u000a\u000a"But it also could end up putting more pressure on him to move more government spectrum into the market to support wireless broadband," said Guggenheim Securities analyst Paul Gallant.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, the administration said it would make 500 megahertz of spectrum available in the next 10 years for broadband.\u000a\u000aThe growing use of wireless devices like Apple Inc's iPad tablet and Google Inc's suite of Android-powered smartphones has added to the urgency to find more space on the airwaves.\u000a\u000aMobile Future's Spalter said he was troubled that the 27-page strategy memorandum did not once mention spectrum.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Communications Commission said earlier in the month it was ready to work with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which manages government spectrum, to gauge if it was feasible for government users to share the same spectrum with commercial wireless operators.\u000a\u000aU.S. Chief Information Officer Steven VanRoekel said on a call with reporters that freeing government airwaves for use by commercial wireless providers is a conversation the White House wants to have with the FCC, NTIA and the Commerce Department.\u000a\u000a"America as a country is going to be faced with a spectrum crunch, and we need to really look at opportunities there," VanRoekel said.\u000a\u000aMedley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva said the sweeping government shift to mobile apps may serve as a tacit heads-up to federal agencies that the administration eyes mobile broadband as the future of the Internet.\u000a\u000a"Still, the power of the presidency and Obama's use of the bully pulpit do not guarantee that a significant amount of additional spectrum will be returned by the Pentagon and other federal departments anytime in the near future," Silva said. "It will be trench warfare."

VA new mobile marketing survey from Harris Interactive says that the demographic group most interested in receiving mobile advertising is mobile owners with children. This group is interested in receiving opt-in alerts from brands, says the study, and the adults in households with children are also generally more "promotionally active" than others, meaning more likely to take part in marketing promotions like couponing, discounts and daily deals.\u000a\u000aThose with children under 6-years old were the most receptive to this form of advertising, with 35% in favor of opt-in alerts that arrived via their mobile phone.\u000a\u000aThose interested in opt-in alerts about new products, sales or promotions from their favorite merchants, stores or restaurants also included parents with slightly older children, those aged 6-12. In that group, 32% showed interest in this type of mobile marketing.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, 25% of those without children were interested. However, even if "only" a quarter of mobile users sans kids are interested in alerts, that's still an attractive number to those building services using this sort of technology, we would think.\u000a\u000aAlso of note, those with young children are the most active online coupon users (e.g. Groupon, etc.), with 36% showing interest. That's double the interest of those without children (18%).\u000a\u000aNot surprisingly, if somewhat stereotypically, this group of engaged savers is comprised of more women than men. Twenty eight per cent of women between 35 and 54 stated interest in mobile marketing initiatives, compared with only 22% of men.\u000a\u000aThe survey was conducted by Harris Interactive in May with over 2,000 US adult participants. Like many studies of this nature, it was commissioned by a company with an interest in the area, in this case, Placecast, makers of various real-time and location-based technologies for mobile alerting and ads.\u000a\u000aAccording to Placecast's CEO, Alistair Goodman, these findings point to the potential for marketing to people with kids via mobile devices. "Mobile Moms and Dads may not have the time to open an app and search for information, but they see the value and ease of receiving text alerts," he says.\u000a\u000aThis survey is only one part of the research conducted by Harris Interactive that's attempting to identify trends in mobile marketing. More research is now available on Placecast's blog, where the company examines overall consumer receptivity to mobile marketing initiatives.\u000a\u000aHere, for example, the study's findings state that one-third of Americans who have currently signed up for mobile marketing alerts indicate that such services impact their decision to go into stores, and 27% report that mobile programs have impacted their decision to buy products in physical retail locations.\u000a\u000aAnother figure that jumped out at us from this additional research was the limited impact of "check-in" services like Foursquare and Gowalla, findings that back up Forrester's recent research that essentially called the services "hype" (for now).\u000a\u000aPlacecast (via Harris' research) found that only 7% of men and 3% of women showed interest in these types of location-based social networks. In comparison, 40% were avid users of text messaging. "With check-in services only available on smart phones (which comprise roughly 21% of all mobile phones in the US), reach for marketers through these platforms is still a question," notes the Placecast blog post.

VApple has more than $81 billion parked overseas. Microsoft has $54 billion, Google $43 billion and Cisco $42 billion.\u000a\u000aBeing flush with cash is a good thing, but it also poses a public relations problem for US technology giants amid an election year debate about economic patriotism.\u000a\u000aSome say the shifting of profits overseas is a huge tax avoidance scheme, and that loopholes should be closed.\u000a\u000aOthers say the situation calls for a "tax holiday" to encourage firms to repatriate funds and invest in the US economy.\u000a\u000aThe cash stockpile is not only a tech phenomenon. Various estimates say more than $1 trillion in US corporate cash is now held overseas.\u000a\u000aBut the most prominent and fastest-growing cash piles come from those tech firms that can easily use transfers among foreign subsidiaries to keep US tax liabilities low.\u000a\u000a"Any company with intellectual property, whether it is software or how to make a drug, has the opportunity to assign the ownership to a foreign subsidiary in a tax haven," said Robert McIntyre, director of the activist group Citizens for Tax Justice.\u000a\u000aIn examining Apple, McIntyre said, "what you discover is that essentially all of the money it has offshore has never been taxed by anyone."\u000a\u000aA July report by Moody's Investors Service said 22 US-based technology companies had $289 billion, 70 percent of their total cash, overseas at the end of March and forecast this would grow to $400 billion within three years.\u000a\u000aMoody's said companies are reluctant to bring these funds back to US soil where they would be taxed, possibly at the top corporate rate of 35 percent.\u000a\u000aUnder US law, companies get a deferral of these taxes until the money is repatriated.\u000a\u000aUntil recently, some major companies had been lobbying for a new "tax holiday" to allow repatriation at a reduced rate, similar to a 2004 effort which allowed firms a tax rate of just 5.25 percent.\u000a\u000aMicrosoft and Cisco, along with other multinationals such as pharmaceutical giant Pfizer joined an effort last year, saying it could create some 2.9 million jobs.\u000a\u000aThe group called WinAmerica suspended its effort as the US presidential election ramped up.\u000a\u000aBut a WinAmerica spokesman said the group "is committed to working with Congress and the administration after the election to reform the tax code and inject nearly a trillion dollars into the US economy."\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Apple chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer expressed a similar view, saying, "repatriating the cash from offshore would result in significant tax consequences under current US law."\u000a\u000a"We have expressed our views with Congress and the administration. We think that the current tax laws provide a considerable economic disincentive to US companies that might otherwise repatriate the substantial amount of foreign cash that they have," Oppenheimer said.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration has opposed a tax holiday, saying the 2004 effort failed to deliver on its promise.\u000a\u000aFormer assistant treasury secretary Michael Mundaca said last year of the 2004 tax holiday: "Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it increased US investment or jobs, and it cost taxpayers billions."\u000a\u000aPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has proposed replacing the US system of "worldwide" taxation with a "territorial" system, meaning profits would be taxed only in the jurisdictions earned.\u000a\u000aA Romney campaign statement says the current rules "encourage American multinational companies to park their profits permanently overseas."\u000a\u000aBut Seth Hanlon of the Center for American Progress said the Romney tax plan would "enhance the tax code's rewards for moving jobs and investments overseas" and "provide a gratuitous windfall" to some firms while cutting US tax receipts.\u000a\u000aApple has been a particular target of those seeking new revenues.\u000a\u000aAn analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice found that if worldwide profits are included, Apple's effective tax rate in the US is around 12 to 14 percent in the period from 2006 to 2011 instead of the 31 percent in company documents.\u000a\u000aMcIntyre said the only effective way to bring up the rate would be a worldwide tax system without loopholes like deferral, which he said costs the US some $600 billion over 10 years.\u000a\u000aJacob Frenkel, a Maryland attorney who specializes in corporate governance, said the effort by Apple and others to keep taxes low in not just fully legal, but also in line with their fiduciary duties.\u000a\u000a"Their primary obligation is to their shareholders and to do what is in the best interest of the company," Frenkel said.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Frenkel said that "more and more American corporations are finding the US regulatory structure to be so burdensome that they almost regret they are US-based corporations."\u000a\u000aChristopher Bergin, a tax lawyer who publishes a series of newsletters on fiscal matters, said blaming companies like Apple misses the point.\u000a\u000a"The problem is not Apple, the problem is the US Congress," Bergin told AFP. "The corporate tax system is broken."\u000a\u000aBergin said that the US tax code for business is so full of loopholes, big firms employ armies of lawyers and experts to determine how to legally reduce taxes.\u000a\u000aSome of these loopholes have exotic-sounding names like a "Double Irish" or "Dutch Sandwich," which refer to specific techniques to transfer among subsidiaries to lower taxes.\u000a\u000a"There is nothing wrong with Apple taking advantage of the tax rules as written," Bergin said. "As far as unfair, it's the tax code.\u000a\u000a"So simplify the tax code, eliminate the loopholes. Maybe it is time to eliminate the corporate tax code and replace it with something else."

VTwitter's latest transparency report provides a country-wise breakdown of the number of removal and information requests various agencies made between July and December 2013.\u000a\u000aAccording to the country-specific data shared by Twitter, India made a total of eight removal requests in the six-month period, requesting removal of tweets by (or complete accounts of) 54 Twitter users. Of these eight requests, two were court orders, while others were made by government agencies, police or 'others'. Twitter says it withheld 13 tweets based on these requests, but did not remove any accounts based on requests coming from India between July and December 2013. This data includes all instances where Twitter employed its Country Withheld Content (CWC) tool.\u000a\u000aThe number of requests coming from Indian agencies is a big change compared to the previous six-month period, where India made a total of two removal requests, involving "less than 10" user accounts. It's worth noting that in case the number of requests (or accounts) in the specified period is less than 10, Twitter says it does not include the exact number "to minimise potential risk to ongoing investigations and matters of public safety".\u000a\u000aThe latest data represents a 500 percent increase (at the very least) in the number of users under India's radar in the current reporting preiod, presuming the worst-case scenario that the "less than 10" for the preceding six months represents nine accounts.\u000a\u000aTwitter also revealed that India made a total of 19 account information requests in the last six months of 2013, asking for details of 27 accounts. Twitter says it responded with 'some information' on accounts mentioned in 32 percent of the requests, which translates to six requests by our calculation. However, the exact number of accounts included in these requests was unspecified. In the preceding six-month period, both the requests and accounts involved where "less than 10" .\u000a\u000aTwitter received over 1,400 information requests globally involving over 2,100 Twitter accounts, and it responded with 'some information' in half the cases.\u000a\u000aThe popular micr-blogging site revealed over 300 removal requests from countries across the globe, a sharp increase from the previous period.\u000a\u000aThe full report is available on Twitter's website.

VMohammad Akhlaq, 50, was killed by a mob in Dadri, UP, on September 28, 2015. (File photo)\u000aAllahabad:  Uttar Pradesh government has submitted before the Allahabad High Court that its investigation into Dadri lynching case has been "impartial" and that the petition filed by a Noida-based BJP leader, who is among the accused, seeking the CBI probe into the matter was "politically motivated".\u000aThe submissions were made by the state government in its counter-affidavit filed yesterday on the petition of Sanjay Singh, who had alleged that investigation into the mob attack on the house of Mohd Akhlaq in September last year over alleged beef rumour was not taking place in a free and fair manner.\u000aThe petitioner had also requested that the matter be handed over to the CBI for investigation, alleging that since he was associated with the BJP, he was "falsely implicated" in the case by the police at the instance of the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state.\u000aHowever, in its counter-affidavit, filed through Additional Advocate General Imran Ullah, the state government repudiated the petitioner's contentions and sought to highlight that the local police had acted swiftly soon after Akhlaq was beaten to death and his young son Danish brutally thrashed by a mob which had accused them of having consumed beef.\u000aThe state government also underscored that the FIR in the case was lodged not more than 30 minutes after the incident took place and asserted that the demand for a CBI probe was being raised by the petitioner for "political reasons".\u000aA division bench comprising justices Ajai Lamba and Raghvendra Kumar fixed May 4 as the next date of hearing in the matter while granting time to the petitioner to file rejoinder.\u000a

VMicrosoft Corp will take $100 off the price of its Xbox One gaming console and let users view popular entertainment apps such as Netflix and ESPN without a $60-plus "Live" subscription, hoping to spur sales against rival devices like Sony's Playstation 4 and Amazon's Fire TV.\u000a\u000aThe moves mark another reversal for the software giant on the Xbox One, which is lagging Sony's PS4 in sales and faces competition from existing consoles, streaming boxes such as Apple TV and Amazon's new $99 gaming-and-entertainment device.\u000a\u000aMicrosoft has backtracked several times in marketing its gaming console. It dropped a requirement that Xbox One users maintain a constant Internet connection before the console went on sale. And it decided to allow support for used games after an outpouring of outrage from gamers last year.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the company said it will now sell the Xbox One for $399, or $499 with a "Kinect" motion sensor, starting June 9. Executives had previously talked about the Kinect, which tracks hand and body movements, as integral to the device's experience.\u000a\u000a"That's going to appeal to our fans on Xbox 360 who have been excited to try Xbox One but, because of affordability options, haven't had the opportunity," Yusuf Mehdi, Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an interview. "So we think that's going to grow the market."\u000a\u000aAs with Sony'sPlayStation and Nintendo's Wii U consoles, Xbox One and Xbox 360 users will not be charged by Microsoft to run entertainment apps starting June.\u000a\u000aPreviously, only those who subscribed to its Xbox LIVE game and entertainment streaming service, which starts at $60 a year, could stream content from popular apps such as Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go.\u000a\u000aSales of the Xbox one console have lagged Sony's PS4 since their holiday launches. Microsoft Corp said last month it has sold over 5 million Xbox One video game consoles as of April 17. The console went on sale on Nov. 22 in 13 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, a week before Sony's PS4 which sold more than 7 million units as of April 6.

VTata Consultancy Services CEO N. Chandrasekaran on Tuesday said that the acquisition of IT services firm Alti SA will give the company a strong foothold in France. The acquisition will boost TCS' presence in the European region, which is the biggest market for Indian IT firms after North America.\u000aIndia's leading IT firms are looking to reduce their reliance on Britain as they expand in Europe. European companies are also seen as increasingly open to sending IT work to centres in India as it can help them cut IT costs by as much as 70 per cent.\u000a"TCS views Europe as a significant opportunity and we have said that we continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our presence in Europe... in markets like France and Germany and other markets," Mr Chandrasekaran said.\u000aTCS, India's biggest outsourcer, announced the acquisition of Alti SA for 75 million euros (nearly Rs. 550 crore) in an all cash deal. The French provider of business management software services had revenues of 126 million euros in 2012 with customers in financial services, manufacturing and utilities.\u000a"In a market like France, frontend skills are important...strong local presence is critical. We will have 1,200 people joining us who will give us strong presence, analysis skills and tech skills," Mr Chandrasekaran told NDTV. (Read: TCS to acquire French firm Alti for 75 million euro)\u000aAlti SA is a profitable company and we expect to conclude the closure by the end of this quarter and the consolidation will begin from the second quarter of this year, Mr Chandrasekaran said.\u000aTCS will have access to fantastic client base, most of them CAC 40 clients, spread across financial services, utilities, pharma, retail - sectors where TCS has strong solutions and capabilities, Mr Chandrasekaran said.

VGoogle upgraded its popular Google Maps on Monday to suggest faster routes to drivers based on real-time traffic conditions.\u000a\u000aGoogle Maps Navigation, released in beta, or test mode, shows various routes along with estimated travel times and uses red, green and yellow color-coding to show how traffic is moving at any given time.\u000a\u000a"Before today, Navigation would choose whichever route was fastest, without taking current traffic conditions into account," Roy Williams, a software engineer with the Google Maps team, said in a blog post.\u000a\u000a"It would also generate additional alternate directions, such as the shortest route or one that uses highways instead of side roads."\u000a\u000aBut from now on, "our routing algorithms will also apply our knowledge of current and historical traffic to select the fastest route from those alternates," he said. "Navigation will automatically guide you along the best route given the current traffic conditions."\u000a\u000aThe new feature can be used in North America and Europe where both Google Maps Navigation and real-time traffic data are available, Google said.

VApple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and four other technology companies were ordered by a judge to face an antitrust lawsuit claiming they illegally conspired not to poach each other's employees.\u000a\u000aU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, rejected the companies' bid to dismiss claims brought under the federal Sherman antitrust law and California's own antitrust law, the Cartwright Act.\u000a\u000aIn a decision on Wednesday night, Koh said the existence of "Do Not Cold Call" agreements among various defendants "supports the plausible inference that the agreements were negotiated, reached, and policed at the highest levels" of the companies.\u000a\u000a"The fact that all six identical bilateral agreements were reached in secrecy among seven defendants in a span of two years suggests that these agreements resulted from collusion, and not from coincidence," Koh added.\u000a\u000aOther defendants in the case included Adobe Systems Inc, Intuit Inc, Walt Disney Co's Pixar unit and Lucasfilm Ltd. Koh dismissed a claim brought under California's unfair competition law.\u000a\u000aLawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment.\u000a\u000aThe proposed class-action lawsuit was brought by five software engineers who accused the companies of conspiring to limit pay and job mobility by eliminating competition for labor, costing workers hundreds of millions of dollars.\u000a\u000aTheir claims are similar to those raised in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Justice when it settled antitrust probes against the companies.\u000a\u000aWithout admitting wrongdoing, the companies agreed not to take steps to restrict competition for workers, including setting limits on cold-calling and recruiting.\u000a\u000aAmong the revelations stemming from the litigation was a 2007 email trail involving the late Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt, then respectively Apple's and Google's chief executives, over Google's apparent effort to recruit an Apple engineer.\u000a\u000a"I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this," Jobs wrote Schmidt, an Apple director at the time.\u000a\u000aSchmidt forwarded that email to various people, asking if they could "get this stopped."\u000a\u000aEventually, Google's staffing director said the employee who recruited the engineer would be fired, and added: "Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs."\u000a\u000aJoseph Saveri, a lawyer for the five plaintiff engineers, said their case remains on track for a June 2013 trial.\u000a\u000a"This is a significant step forward," Saveri said in an email.\u000a\u000aAll of the defendants are based in California: Adobe in San Jose; Apple in Cupertino; Google and Intuit in Mountain View; Intel in Santa Clara; Lucasfilm in San Francisco; and Pixar in Emeryville. Walt Disney is based in Burbank.\u000a\u000aThe case is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-02509.

Airport medical staff came aboard to help the plane's crew with the birth Thursday.\u000aThe airline said its cabin crews are trained in birthing procedures and both mother and child were taken to a hospital on the island.

VIndia's Deputy Consul general in New York Devyani Khobragade was arrested for allegedly presenting fraudulent documents in support of a visa application for an Indian national employed by her. She was later released from custody on a $25,000 bond.\u000aIn response to media queries, the Indian embassy said it had conveyed its "strong concern to the US government over the action taken against Khobragade" and urged the US side "to resolve the matter with due sensitivity."\u000a Read the full statement here: \u000aWe have been informed that Deputy Consul General of India in New York, Dr. Devyani Khobragade, was taken into custody by law enforcement authorities in New York in the morning of December 12, 2013 while she was dropping her daughter at school. Dr. Khobragade was later released that same evening.\u000aAction was apparently taken against Dr Khobragade on the basis of allegations raised by the officer's former India-based domestic assistant, Ms Sangeeta Richard, who has been absconding since June this year. In this context the Delhi High Court had issued an-interim injunction in September to restrain Ms Richards from instituting any actions or proceedings against Dr Khobragade outside India on the terms or conditions of her employment.\u000aThe US Government had subsequently been requested to locate Ms Richard and facilitate the service of an arrest warrant, issued by the Metropolitan Magistrate of the South District Court in New Delhi under Sections 387, 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code.\u000aThe Embassy of India in Washington DC had immediately conveyed its strong concern to the U.S. Government over the action taken against Dr Khobragade. The US side have been urged to resolve the matter with due sensitivity, taking into account the existing Court case in India that has already been brought to their attention by the Government of India, and the Diplomatic status of the officer concerned.\u000a

Markets were lacklustre with the broader Nifty dropping below the key 5,700 mark in intraday trade, but strong buying towards close saw the benchmarks close near the day's high.\u000aThe Sensex gained 55 points or 0.3 per cent to 18,817 while the broader Nifty advanced 20 points to 5,724. The rupee recovered from near two-month lows and traded higher against the dollar at 54.37.\u000aRealty stocks were the big gainers today.

Whether one can seek vote in the name of religion has to be considered in interpreting Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act," the court order issued today said.\u000aThe Bombay High Court had set aside the election of Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi. The matter was then moved to Supreme Court, which in 1995 overturned the High Court order saying Hindutva is a way of life.\u000aSince then, the issue was raised in the top court many times, including in 2002 when the court referred the matter to a seven-judge bench for clarity.\u000aOn Thursday, the issue was raised before a five-judge Constitution bench in a petition which then directed the Supreme Court registry to place the matter before the Chief Justice of India to constitute a seven-judge bench soon to look into it.\u000a

VThe more than 43,000 Twitter followers of Rosanne Cash, the singer and daughter of Johnny Cash, have come to expect her tart commentary on married life with her husband, John Leventhal, a Grammy-winning musician.\u000a\u000aShe chided him for performing at a concert in jeans he had worn three days in a row. Another day, she posted that he had cajoled her to help organize his "stuff." But Mr. Leventhal, known as Mr. L to Ms. Cash's followers, apparently is not a fan of her enthusiasm for sharing online.\u000a\u000aMs. Cash said in an interview that another time she wrote about her husband taking a nap. When he showed up at the studio, the sound engineer was puzzled, since he had just read Ms. Cash's post online. "I thought you were taking a nap," the engineer said to him.\u000a\u000a"John called me and he was really annoyed," she recalled. "He said, 'Don't tell people I'm taking a nap!' "\u000a\u000aRelationships are hard enough. But the rise of social media - where sharing private moments is encouraged, and provocative and confessional postings can help build a following - has created a new source of friction for couples: what is fair game for sharing with the world?\u000a\u000aIf one half of a couple is not interested in broadcasting the details of a botched dinner or romantic weekend, Facebook postings or tweets can create irritation, embarrassment, miscommunication and bruised egos.\u000a\u000aAfter a few relationship-testing episodes, some spouses have started insisting that their partners ask for approval before posting comments and photographs that include them. Couples also are talking through rules as early as the first date (a kind of social media prenup) about what is O.K. to share. Even tweeting about something as seemingly innocent as a house repair can become a lesson in boundary-setting.\u000a\u000a"There is a standard negotiation that takes place in lots of relationships, but now there are multiple audiences watching," said Lee Rainie, the director of the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, which explores technology and human behavior. "There will be awkward moments, even more so if that negotiation is played out in public."\u000a\u000aInterviews with more than a dozen couples suggest that disagreements over how much to share are common.\u000a\u000aRebecca Gray, a doctoral student at Michigan State in East Lansing, lives with her boyfriend, Ernest Whiting. Last May, Mr. Whiting took a photograph of her face - eyes closed, mouth open wide - slathered in a beauty mask of volcanic mud she bought in Costa Rica.\u000a\u000aIn August, Ms. Gray was at work and received a notification from Facebook that said she had been tagged in a photo. When she looked at it, she found that Mr. Whiting had retrieved the photo from her computer and posted it on his Facebook account. "My jaw dropped," she said. "I tried to remove it, but I could only untag."\u000a\u000aShe e-mailed and sent a text to Mr. Whiting, demanding he take it down. By then, friends and acquaintances had seen it. "It was showing up in my newsfeed," Ms. Gray said. "People said: 'What is this? It is hilarious!' " As a last resort, she logged into his account and removed the photo herself. When Mr. Whiting got home that night, Ms. Gray was waiting. "I said: 'You have lost the privilege of using my computer. What were you thinking?' " Ms. Gray recalled.\u000a\u000aMr. Whiting, for his part, said he was just having fun.\u000a\u000a"I suppose if I thought about it in context, I wouldn't have done it," he said. And he is unlikely to do it again. "She asked for photo approval, and I said yes," he added sheepishly.\u000a\u000aSome couples seek to preserve intimacy by establishing rules early on. Jen Dunlap, who lives in Brooklyn, took a trip to Turks and Caicos in May 2009 with her new boyfriend, Chris Sullivan, an actor and musician. Before they left, she said, Mr. Sullivan asked her not to post photos on Flickr of the couple kissing. "I feel like people don't want to see it," Mr. Sullivan said.\u000a\u000aBut even couples steeped in social media are grappling with the new layer of relationship etiquette. Nozlee Samadzadeh and Jarrett Moran have had active online social presences for years. In 2009, they set up a Tumblr account called Needs More Salt where they post photographs and comment on meals they cook. Ms. Samadzadeh said she once upset Mr. Moran when she joked that he was hapless in the kitchen.\u000a\u000aTo avoid further conflict, the couple agreed to review each other's comments before posting. It was a wise move. Recently, Ms. Samadzadeh said that she almost posted a comment on Needs More Salt expressing annoyance at having to make supper because Mr. Moran was home late. Mr. Moran, though, did not know he was supposed to cook and asked her to rewrite the post. "I don't want to be embarrassed," Mr. Moran said.\u000a\u000aMore often, one partner is more eager to share than the other. Two years ago, Jenny Luu, a skin-care specialist from Washington, D.C., said that she asked her husband, Jason Hamacher, a musician and photographer, to stop posting on Facebook when he was away on business. (She didn't want strangers to know she was home alone.)\u000a\u000aThe couple also owns a 100-year-old home in a historic neighborhood. Two months ago, Ms. Luu bristled when her husband wrote on Facebook about a second round of repairs to their roof.\u000a\u000aFor three years Mr. Hamacher had posted comments and photographs about their home renovation. The accumulation of comments made Ms. Luu uneasy, worried that their friends would think they were bragging. "I don't want people thinking we have so much money, that we are loaded," Ms. Luu said. "I don't want to make people uncomfortable."\u000a\u000aFor some spouses, though, the best defense is ignorance.\u000a\u000aGeorge Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton White House staff member who is now an anchor of "Good Morning America," said he was named "anchor most likely to be anxious about his wife's tweets" at ABC News' 50th-anniversary party in January. He is married to the comedian Alexandra Wentworth, who has more than 42,000 Twitter followers. "I have sort of a simple rule," Mr. Stephanopoulos said, laughing. "Don't ask, don't read."\u000a\u000aMs. Wentworth usually refrains from posting jokes about politics on Twitter, although she said it was hard to resist during the New Hampshire Republican debate in January that Mr. Stephanopoulos helped moderate. "Honey, stop sexting me and pay attention to the debate!" she wrote.\u000a\u000a"I don't think he saw it," Ms. Wentworth said later. He hadn't. (Mr. Stephanopoulos has more than 1.7 million Twitter followers; his posts are mostly work-related.) Nor had he read his wife's off-color joke about a suspect stain on a certain candidate's tie. When asked about it, he stopped laughing. "I'm so glad I didn't know about that," he said.

VDonald Trump is seen in a video screengrab as he apologizes for lewd comments he made about women.\u000aWASHINGTON:  US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump issued a video statement early on Saturday in response to the disclosure of a 2005 videotape of him making lewd remarks about women.\u000aHere is a text of his statement:\u000a"I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.\u000aAnyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize. I've traveled the country talking about change for America but my travels have also changed me. I've spent time with grieving mothers who have lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I have been humbled by the faith they have placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down. Let's be honest. We're living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today. We're losing our jobs. We're less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. I've said some foolish things but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday."\u000a0\u000aComments\u000aSign in using or\u000aLoading...\u000aTo subscribe to email notification for comments, please add your email address.\u000aEmail\u000aName Email\u000aPost to FacebookPost to Twitter\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VIs the Wii U right for you?\u000a\u000aAt last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Nintendo captured most of the spotlight by unveiling the Wii's successor, a high-definition console called the Wii U that utilizes a tablet-like touchscreen controller. Attention alone wasn't enough to declare a victory. Folks weren't, well, feeling it. Critical reaction was mixed, and the Japanese gaming giant's stock dropped.\u000a\u000a"Nintendo has an uphill battle this year," said Morgan Webb, co-host of the G4 gaming show "X-Play." "It's really a branding problem. I think a lot of people are still confused about the Wii U. They're going to have a hard time convincing people that this could be a better gaming experience than the iPad."\u000a\u000aAt this year's E3 convention in Los Angeles next week, Nintendo Co. will attempt to assuage such concerns by introducing gamers to titles that will be available for Wii U when it's expected to launch later this year. Previously, the "Mario Bros." creator only teased what was capable through a series of technology demonstrations.\u000a\u000aE3 comes at a time when the gaming industry could use a few good parties and pep talks. The NPD Group, a research firm that tracks the U.S. sales of game software, hardware and accessories, said that while consumers spent more than $1 billion on games and accompanying gizmos in April, retail sales fell 32 percent from a year ago, the fifth month of decline.\u000a\u000aThe continued interest in cheaper-to-produce mobile, social and downloadable games is expected to be showcased more than ever before at E3, a flashy extravaganza typically focused on building buzz for the loudest and sexiest games. Zynga, the developer of social games like "FarmVille" and "Words With Friends," will have a presence at E3 for the first time.\u000a\u000a"Every time I go to E3, I'm usually surprised," said Jay Wilson, lead designer of the role-playing game "Diablo III." "I expect to be surprised again. What I hope is that no matter what platform people are working on, no matter what new area that they're exploring, the most important thing is gameplay. If a game provides great gameplay, the platform doesn't really matter."\u000a\u000aIndeed, a strong line-up of games will be integral to the future success of the Wii U, a lesson Nintendo learned the hard way after last year's lackluster launch of the 3DS, its glasses-free 3-D handheld device. "X-Play's" Webb thinks Nintendo could win over the E3 crowd if it introduces innovative, unexpected, must-own games that appeal equally to both hardcore and casual gamers.\u000a\u000aUnless Nintendo's fellow first-party publishers Sony Corp. or Microsoft Corp. unveil new hardware or radical updates to their respective PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, the E3 spotlight - for better or worse - will undoubtedly be shining back in Nintendo's direction. (Microsoft and Sony have previously shot down rumors they'd unleash new consoles at this year's E3.)\u000a\u000a"The Wii U was announced last year, and that stimulates all kinds of thoughts about what's possible," said Mark Lamia, the studio head at "Call of Duty: Black Ops II" developer Treyarch. "It'll be interesting to see what happens with the first parties. It's always an exciting time when rumors are in the air, and we see if E3 is the time when they become more than rumors."\u000a\u000aMost other game makers will use the expo to hype new entries in their seemingly never-ending franchises. There's Activision's "Call of Duty: Black Ops II," Microsoft's "Halo 4" and "Forza Horizon," Sony's "God of War: Ascension" and "LittleBigPlanet Karting," Ubisoft's "Far Cry 3" and "Assassin's Creed III," as well as the revealing of several other new chapters.\u000a\u000aSome sequels at E3 are emerging from deep within the vault. Franchises once considered extinct, such as invasion simulator "X-COM," stealthy shooter "Hitman" and town builder "SimCity," will return to a vastly different landscape. Will these once beloved series be re-embraced? It's a strategy that's worked for some ("Twisted Metal") but failed others ("Syndicate").\u000a\u000aElectronic Arts Inc. will show off such games as the real-world military simulator "Medal of Honor: Warfighter," a new iteration of its "Need for Speed" racing series and the sci-fi horror sequel "Dead Space 3." EA, like many publishers, will also be talking technology, focusing on advancements with its Frostbite graphics engine, digital distribution and cloud computing\u000a\u000a"Cloud competing isn't rocket science," said Patrick Soderlund, executive vice president at the EA Games label. "It is a great feature that we're embracing as a game company. It's just a natural evolution that I think will be used in most of our products, to some extent."

VMehbooba Mufti said addressing the genuine political, economic and security concerns of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is an issue which goes beyond power politics. (File photo)\u000aJammu:  A day after taking over, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti today said "decisive measures" would be required to end the scenario of "despair and trust-deficit" in the state and informed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed full support from the Centre.\u000a"The Prime Minister called me this morning, immediately on his return from Saudi Arabia, reassuring me of full support from the Government of India in mitigating the sufferings of the people of Jammu and Kashmir," she told a gathering of people who had come to felicitate her.\u000aMs Mufti said addressing the genuine political, economic and security concerns of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is an issue which goes beyond power politics and requires a decisive political will at various levels.\u000a"We shall have to take decisive measures to end the scenario of despair and trust deficit," she said.\u000aShe said the PDP-BJP 'Agenda of Alliance' is not a pact between two political parties but an agenda of more than one billion people of the country to usher Jammu and Kashmir into an era of peace, stability and prosperity.\u000a"Productive development and inclusive prosperity is possible only in an environment of peace and stability which necessitates that not only the people of Jammu and Kashmir but that of the whole country join this new enterprise of hope to pull the state out of the morass and resolutely address the challenges confronting it," she said.\u000aShe said her late father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and PM Modi had a shared vision for peace and prosperity of the state and the present government would work with fresh resolve towards implementing that vision so that the people of Jammu and Kashmir could reap the fruits of globalisation and economic liberalisation like their counterparts in other states of the country.\u000a"When I met the Prime Minister in New Delhi recently, he told me that Mufti Sahab's vision is the only way to end the problems in and around Jammu and Kashmir," she said.\u000aShe said the state government has the full support of the Prime Minister and his team.\u000a

VSri Lankan pro-government party activists hold placards bearing the image of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse during a government-sanctioned May Day rally in Colombo on May 1, 2014. AFP\u000aColombo:  President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said Sri Lanka is in the process of implementing all demands made by the sponsors of the UNHRC resolution against it except for allowing an international probe into alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war with the LTTE.\u000aThe assertion was made by the Sri Lankan President during a meeting yesterday with Seiji Kihara, Japan's Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs.\u000aRajapaka told the Japanese Minister, "Please tell this truth to rest of the world. Except for an international inquiry we are in the process of implementing all other demands made by sponsors of the Resolution."\u000aThe President's office quoted Kihara as saying that the UNHRC resolution was unhelpful to Sri Lanka.\u000a"We considered whether the Resolution on Sri Lanka moved in the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva would help Sri Lanka. We decided it will not. That is why we abstained when the vote was taken," Kihara was quoted as saying.\u000a"We are not ready to accept biased reports prepared by international bodies. We are confident that Sri Lanka is capable of solving its problems one by one. What is needed is to engage the international community," he said.\u000aJapan along with India was one of the 12 countries which abstained in the UNHRC vote in Geneva in March.\u000aThe US-sponsored resolution was adopted with 24 countries voting in favour.\u000aThe resolution demanded the setting up of an international investigation into alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka during the last phase of the nearly three decades-long conflict with the LTTE.\u000aSri Lanka has vowed not to cooperate with the investigation.\u000aMeanwhile, a nationalist organisation demanded that Sri Lanka should not allow the officials of the UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay into the country to carry out the international investigation.\u000a"We ask the government what their stand on this.They must never be allowed into the country," Dr Gunadasa Amarasekera of the Nationalist Organisation Collective said.\u000a

VPriyanka Gandhi Vadra has accused Narendra Modi of insulting her father Rajiv Gandhi\u000aAmethi:  For the first time today, Narendra Modi, the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, who was campaigning in Amethi, attacked Priyanka Gandhi directly for her "arrogance." She was unflinching in her reply, vowing that Amethi "ka ek ek booth se jawaab aayega (each polling booth will exact revenge".) Without naming Mr Modi, Priyanka said, "They have insulted my martyred father in Amethi....the people here will never forgive him."\u000aAmethi was the constituency of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who was assassinated in 1991. His son, Rahul, older than Priyanka by a year, has represented it in parliament since he entered politics in 2004.\u000aPriyanka's near-daily confrontations of Mr Modi through her public speeches has become the new normal of the final stages of the national election, which is expected to deliver a crushing defeat for the Congress.\u000aSo far, in his rallies, Mr Modi, 64, has been scathing of Rahul and his mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi; he has accused them of helping Priyanka's husband, Robert Vadra, of amassing an illicit fortune through sweetheart land deals. However, he had been gentler on Priyanka, saying that he understands her need "as a daughter" to defend her mother and brother, whose campaigns she is managing.\u000aToday's turnaround comes after Priyanka responding with a dismissive "who?" when reporters asked her yesterday about Smriti Irani, the BJP's candidate from Amethi. ("Who?" Asks Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Smriti Irani)\u000a"Look at the arrogance of the Congress, one of their leaders says 'Who is Smriti Irani?'," Mr Modi, 64, said today. (In Amethi, Modi takes on Priyanka, slams her "arrogance")\u000aAmethi votes on Wednesday. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has put up Hindi poet Kumar Vishwas as its candidate.\u000aIn a litany of taunts to the Gandhis delivered at his rally in Amethi today, Mr Modi said, "Let them abuse me as much as they want to. There are just days left now... I'm glad I could at least serve as an outlet for their anger." (Highlights of Narendra Modi's speech)\u000a

VThe rupee recovered from early losses on Tuesday to end the session with marginal gains as the government's auction of mobile airwaves attracted strong demand, including from bidders such as Vodafone, offsetting concerns about global risk aversion.\u000aThe government received $7 billion worth of total bids on Monday, the first day of the auction and looked set to top its minimum target of raising $1.8 billion initially.\u000aForeign companies like Vodafone and Telenor would have to convert their dollars to rupees if they win licences, with the first tranche needing to be paid within 10 days of allocation.\u000aThe rupee also benefited as Asian currencies firmed up later in the session on Tuesday as the region is seen better placed than other emerging markets to face the fallout of any global risk aversion due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering and concerns of a slowdown in China.\u000a"There have been rumours of fund flows related to the mobile spectrum auction over the last two days. The recovery in stocks also helped the rupee," said Uday Bhatt, a senior manager at UCO Bank.\u000aHe expects the rupee to trade in a range of 62-63.50 to the dollar in the near term.\u000aThe partially convertible rupee closed at 62.5250/5350 per dollar compared with Monday's 62.56/57, after initially falling to a session low of 62.81.\u000aDealers spotted healthy dollar selling by foreign banks, which they attributed to inflows related to the spectrum sale.\u000aMeanwhile, shares rebounded from four-month lows, also helping the rupee. India's benchmark BSE index ended flat on Tuesday after declining as much as 1.2 percent.\u000aConcerns about selling by foreign investors have clouded the outlook for Indian markets. Overseas funds sold a net $1.7 billion worth of shares and debt over seven sessions to Monday, according to preliminary exchange and regulatory data.\u000aStill, India is seen as less vulnerable than last year when similar fears of a Fed tapering sent the rupee crashing to a record low of 68.85 to the dollar on August 28.\u000aIn the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 62.95, while the three-month was at 63.84.\u000a

And I will definitely create that in my films. I would like to present women in all their diversity and colours in my films. I will have more interesting women characters in my films," Kiran Rao said.\u000aSince the film is still being written, Kiran Rao says she can't say in which genre will it fit.\u000aKiran Rao was present at the felicitation function of women national award winners by WIFT (Women in Film and Television Association India). She is proud of all the women achievers but feels importance should be given to regional cinema.\u000a"As an audience we don't get to watch regional movies and I wish and hope we get to see it. We must go and see which film is put in theatre, be it Telugu or Tamil or Bengali, etc. We must watch, we may not know the actors and the team, we must go and see the film at least as one may like it," she said.\u000aAlso, since Mother's Day is around the corner (May 12), Kiran Rao, wife of actor-filmmaker Aamir Khan, is quite thrilled to be a mother herself.\u000a"I am thrilled to be a mother and I am sure everyone who is a mother feels the same way. So I wish success in this very exciting and complex journey of mothers," she said.\u000a

VStockholm:\u000aHennes & Mauritz (H&M) will open its first store in India this year, it said on Wednesday, as the world's second-biggest fashion retailer becomes the latest to take advantage of the opening of Asia's third-largest economy to foreign operators.\u000aH&M, which said last year it plans to spend around 100 million euros on an initial 50 stores in India, received final approval in December from the Indian government to invest in the country.\u000a"We are very excited to open our first store in India. It is one of the most exciting countries in the world right now, with so much potential," H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson said in a statement.\u000aThe Swedish retailer has almost tripled store numbers over the past decade to over 3,100 outlets in 53 countries, but it has lagged bigger rival Inditex in expanding in fast-growing emerging markets.\u000aH&M still makes about 80 percent of sales in Europe, while Inditex, with over 6,000 stores in 86 countries, makes about 20 percent of sales in Asian economies versus 6 percent for H&M.\u000aH&M said last month it planned to open 375 new stores worldwide in 2014, including 80-90 in China. It also plans to enter Australia and the Philippines this year.\u000aA flurry of international retailers, including Swedish budget furniture chain IKEA, are looking to expand into India after its government moved in 2012 to allow foreign firms to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the country. Inditex is already in India through a joint venture.\u000aIndian retail consultancy Technopak has predicted the textile and clothing market in the country would more than double to $141 billion by 2021, from $58 billion in 2012.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

Let's take a look at how it stands against the soon to release LG Optimus 2X.\u000a\u000aBoth the devices boast of similar specifications that includes a 1 GHz dual core NVIDIA tegra 2 processor, 8 MP camera, 1080p video camcorder, Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 n, DLNA, HDMI out and support HSPA+ network. However, there are some differences that distinguish the two devices. The Galaxy S II has a 4.3-inch WVGA (480 x 800) Super AMOLED plus touch screen display whereas the LG Optimus 2X has a 4-inch WVGA (480x800) TFT LCD touchscreen display. The Galaxy S II has a whopping 16GB of internal storage as compared to the Optimus 2X that has an internal storage of 8GB. Samsung has added Cisco based enterprise solutions to attract the enterprise users while the Optimus 2X shows off dual display support (HDMI mirroring) and may be upgradable to Android 2.4 when it is ready.

VA few dozen members of Cuba's small but growing Twitter community have met in real space for the first time. They got to put unfamiliar faces with familiar user names, and they commiserated about the woeful Internet access on an island that has the second-worst Web connectivity rate in the world.\u000a\u000aGathering at a downtown Havana pavilion on Friday, Cuba's Twitterati wrote their online handles on name tags emblazoned with the Cuban flag and the hash tag used to organize the event, TwittHab. One by one they introduced themselves, told of their history with social media and compared numbers of followers.\u000a\u000a"Many of us didn't know each other. This is about stepping out from behind the 'at' symbol," said "alondraM," who was only identifying herself by her username.\u000a\u000aNext to her, "cuba1er.plan," a.k.a. Alejandro Cruz, said Cubans like him are increasingly using social media to share interests and information.\u000a\u000aTheir ranks are still relatively sparse because Cuba lags far behind the rest of the world in connectivity, besting only the Indian Ocean island chain of Mayotte, according to a report by the consulting firm Akamai Technologies Inc.\u000a\u000aThe decades-old U.S. economic embargo has left Cuba without a hardwired connection to the rest of the world, and the island relies on slow, costly satellite service. The Twitter users expressed hope things will soon speed up now that an undersea fiber-optic cable to Venezuela has arrived in Cuba. It could go online this month.\u000a\u000aFor now, plodding dial-up is about the only option - and even those accounts have historically been hard to get and prohibitively expensive for most Cubans. The government says it must use its limited bandwidth carefully and gives priority to usage with what it deems a social purpose.\u000a\u000aCuba's National Statistics Office reported last year that just 2.9 percent of islanders said they had direct Internet access, most through their schools and workplaces, though that number doesn't reflect the black market sale of minutes on dial-up accounts.\u000a\u000aThe real figure is more likely between 5 percent and 10 percent, said Ted Henken, a professor of sociology and Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York who has traveled to Cuba frequently and is writing a book on social media and civil society on the island.\u000a\u000aIt all creates unique challenges for tweeters in Cuba. For one thing, their local audience is relatively small. Also, cost and availability limit how much time they can spend connected. And while Twitter is popular in other nations among smartphone-toting\u000a\u000atechnophiles, limitations here mean most Twitter interaction happens on computers.\u000a\u000aWhen users here want to send a tweet from the field, they send a cellphone text message to an overseas number that converts and posts it, said Mario Leonart, a 36-year-old from Villa Clara known online as "maritovoz."\u000a\u000aIt's expensive: $4 for the initial setup, plus $1 per tweet. Send 20 tweets and you've already equaled Cuba's average official monthly salary.\u000a\u000aSome get around that by hitting up followers abroad when they start to run low on funds, Henken said, citing the case of one tweeter he monitors.\u000a\u000a"Like most Cubans he doesn't have a whole lot of money to be able to do this, but he tweets all the time," Henken said. "So he must have this feedback from people who follow him, because they put money in his account."\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Henken said, Twitter's immediacy and the fact that Cubans are learning to take it mobile are creating an incipient "new narrative" that at least has the potential to challenge state domination of information.\u000a\u000a"Just like in the rest of the world, it can be used as a form of pushing back against the mainstream media - and, of course, in Cuba the mainstream media is the official government media," Henken said. "So it does act as a corrective on what's happening or gives another version of events."\u000a\u000aFor a little more than an hour Friday, the tweeters talked about strategies for staying connected and dreamed aloud about having Internet in their homes.\u000a\u000aThe event was organized by Leunam Rodriguez, a 26-year-old radio station employee who has been tweeting for just a few months.\u000a\u000aRodriguez, who doesn't fall into either the pro- or anti-government camps, pitched the meet-up as an apolitical gathering.\u000a\u000aBut when the venue was moved from a pizzeria to the Cuba Pavilion, Yoani Sanchez, known internationally for her blog writings opposing the government, complained that the meeting had been "kidnapped" by officialdom. Ultimately she skipped both the gathering and the handful of tweeters who met at the pizzeria.\u000a\u000aRodriguez denied that the site change was politically motivated.\u000a\u000a"I've said that I don't belong to any organization. I'm just a Cuban," he said.\u000a\u000aHenken said tweeting in Cuba will involve politics, no matter what individual tweeters might want.\u000a\u000a"I think Twitter is political even when it's not political," he said. "The (Cuban) system is very monolithic; therefore even if you use Twitter to promote a sewing circle ... it's political because it is unfiltered."

VAirtel has started the countdown to the nationwide launch of its mobile wallet solution. Airtel Money, launched in January 2011 as a pilot in Chennai and Delhi/ , has opened its doors to Airtel customers all across India, ahead of the official launch of the service tomorrow.\u000a\u000aRegistration for the Express account is free and enables the user to make utility payments and purchase rail/ flight tickets on various portals online. An Express account comes with a daily limit as well as maximum account balance of Rs. 10,000.\u000a\u000aA customer can upgrade to a Power account by paying Rs. 50 as a processing fee and filling the necessary paperwork at the nearest authorized Airtel money outlet or Airtel relationship centre. Power accounts get enhanced privileges like ability to pay for movie tickets, shopping and other extras like insurance premium, subscriptions & donations. Power accounts can also transfer money to other Airtel Money customers as well any bank account via transfer.\u000a\u000aPower accounts come with an enhanced daily limit and maximum account balance of Rs. 50,000. Both account types have a single transaction limit of Rs. 5000, unless you are using a special Airtel SIM (available right now only in Delhi and Chennai), in which case no transaction limit applies.\u000a\u000aThere are no minimum balance requirements. Minimum amount you can spend is Rs. 5 while minimum amount you can transfer to a bank account or Airtel Money customer is Rs. 10.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1% of transaction amount, subject to a maximum of Rs. 50\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRs. 5 for transactions up to Rs. 500, Rs. 10 for transactions above\u000a\u000a2% of transaction amount, subject to minimum of Rs. 10\u000a\u000aAirtel Money is expected to compete with other mobile payment solutions like Paymate. Paymate works across all mobile operators and thus, theoretically, has a larger customer base it can target. But Airtel has the trust factor and the ability to integrate the solution with its existing offerings going in its favour.\u000a\u000aWhile this initiative is to be appreciated, the services on offer right now do not seem very different from what customers can already do via mobile banking. Besides, how are you expected to buy a flight ticket with a 5000 transaction limit? We expect this limit to be done away with fast.\u000a\u000aThe shortcomings aside, it does give Airtel an opportunity to build a customer base as it waits for NFC technology to go mainstream (like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus). That is when things will get really exciting in the mobile payment space, giving Airtel a ready-made customer base to tap into.

VYouTube Gaming is getting a host of new features. The gaming-focused video streaming service has gotten rid of the sidebars on its homepage to make navigation easier - with new pages to manage games and channels - as well as to boost discovery of new content. There's a new "Live" tab on the homepage that brings top streams, games, and videos from subscribed channels. In addition to this, there's an Android live stream player - a feature that was limited to iOS and browsers (via HTML5). It will support quality switching, 60fps viewing, and DVR mode.\u000a\u000aAlso new is a pop-out player on Android. This will allow users to pop out the YouTube Gaming player, allowing it to be visible above other apps on your device.\u000a\u000a(Also see:Twitch Partners Cannot Stream on YouTube Gaming: Report)\u000a\u000aThere's more to it - the YouTube Gaming mobile app for Android and iOS will be made available to a few more countries.\u000a\u000a"Now we're inviting more players to the game. Starting today, the YouTube Gaming mobile app will be available on iOS and Android in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland, homes to top gaming creators like jacksepticeye, Vanoss, and TypicalGamer," wrote YouTube Gaming Product Manager Alan Joyce. After which he hinted that "many more countries are coming soon".\u000a\u000aIt'll be interesting to see if India makes the cut anytime soon. Reason being, the company just took interest in gaming content out of India, hosting the country's first workshop on gaming. With video streaming consumption being decidedly mainstream, we wonder if there are enough gaming content creators (and the requisite volume of gaming viewers) to justify a local release.

VMore than six months after the infamous surveillance firm Hacking Team disappeared in the wake of a massive breach on its own network, it seems the Italian software company is prepping a return to the game.\u000a\u000aSecurity researchers have found new OS X malware in the wild that they believe has been developed by Hacking Team. The malware, researchers note, installs a copy of the software firm's Remote Code Systems compromise platform, leading them to believe that the infamous, controversial Italian firm is back.\u000a\u000aThe malware in question installs different programs on a computer. "The dropper is using more or less the same techniques as older Hacking Team RCS samples, and its code is more or less the same," wrote security researcher Pedro Vilaca.\u000a\u000aThe Hacking Team suffered a massive breach on its network last July. The hack saw over 400GB of data including sensitive information such as firm's relationship with governments, emails, source code, and exploits published online. The group has been mysteriously quiet since. "Either this is an old sample or HackingTeam are still using the same code base as before the hack," Vilaca wrote.\u000a\u000aThe sample was uploaded on Google-owned VirusTotal last month, and at the time, no popular antivirus program was able to detect it. At the time of writing, 15 antivirus programs including AVG, Eset-Nod 32, F-Secure, BitDefender, and TrendMicro were able to detect it.\u000a\u000aPatrick Wardle of Synack security firm believes that the installer was last updated in October or November last year. He added that the sample of malware utilises most of the same code as old Hacking Team malware.\u000a\u000a"I just found some unique code in this dropper. This code checks for newer OS X versions and does not exist in the leaked source code," Vilaca wrote. "Either someone is maintaining and updating HackingTeam code (why the hell would someone do that!?!?!) or this is indeed a legit sample compiled by HackingTeam themselves. Reusage and repurpose of malware source code happens (Zeus for example) but my gut feeling and indicators seem to not point in that direction."\u000a\u000aMany questions remain unanswered for now. It is not clear how this malware gets installed on a system. Wardle, however, has found out a way to check if your Mac is infected with it. He urges users to check for a file "Bs-V7qIU.cYL" in a folder called "~/Library/Preferences/8pHbqThW/ directory."

VWith respite from rain and flood waters receding, the Army has scaled up its air-lift rescue operations in Jammu and Kashmir today. But there is a complete breakdown of the telecommunication network and could take two more days to fix. Over 150 people are reported dead in the state's worst floods in 60 years.\u000aComments\u000aSign in using or\u000aLoading...\u000aTo subscribe to email notification for comments, please add your email address.\u000aEmail\u000aName Email\u000aPost to FacebookPost to Twitter\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VVirat Kohli scored a century in the maiden Test match at Indore.\u000aSuccess has been following Virat Kohli for the last couple of years. Almost every bad delivery that touches his willow turns into a four or a six. But that has been the trend in limited overs cricket, in particular.\u000aKohli hasn't flourished as he would have liked to in Tests but the India captain always comes out fighting against the toughest of oppositions when needed.\u000aHe added another feather in his cap when he notched his 13th century in Test cricket in the third and final game of the series against New Zealand at the Holkar Stadium in Indore, where the first international five-day game is taking place, on Saturday.\u000a

VAs Kerala gears up for upcoming Assembly Election 2016. There is much to look in the place rather than battling parties to fetch seat of power. Here are 10 place to visit if you have checked in at Kerala.\u000a\u000aTea Gardens (Munnar): Assam tea may be famous in the whole world but Kerala\u2019s Munnar region holds significant place in traveller diary for its evergreen tea gardens.\u000a\u000aAthirappilly Waterfalls: How about having a date with nature when you are in Kerala. This place can be as soothing as heaven on earth.\u000a\u000aGuruvayur Temple: For all the devotees in town, there are many offerings. One of the famous temple Guruvayur Temple can be the choice for travellers.\u000a\u000aKerala Backwaters: The backwaters of Alleppey could be described as a mirage of what heaven must look like on a tranquil day; only, it\u2019s not a mirage but very real. Alleppey is blessed with a rather peculiar geographical feature of having the water at level with the land.\u000a\u000aLighthouse Beach: Visiting Kerala and not beaches is a crime and when it comes on deciding which one is the best, Lighthouse Beach can be the favourite choice.\u000a\u000aBekal Fort: For fort lovers there is an offering too.\u000a\u000aFolklore Museum: And if you belong to the category who love to explore the history, what\u2019s better than visiting a museum.

VWashington:  A US Air Force officer in charge of preventing sexual attacks has been arrested for assaulting a woman, police said Monday, in the latest setback for a force struggling to stem a pervasive rape problem.\u000aUS Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel "expressed outrage and disgust over the troubling allegations and emphasized that this matter will be dealt with swiftly and decisively," Pentagon spokesman George Little said.\u000aLieutenant Colonel Jeff Krusinski, head of the Air Force's sexual assault prevention and response program, was drunk when he "approached a female victim in a parking lot and grabbed her breasts and buttocks," according to a police report from Arlington, Virginia, just outside the US capital.\u000a"The victim fought the suspect off as he attempted to touch her again and alerted police," police said.\u000aKrusinski, 41, was charged with sexual battery and held on a $5,000 bond, it said.\u000aLittle confirmed Krusinski was head of the service's prevention program and said he has been removed from his post pending the outcome of an investigation.\u000a"The American people, including our service members, should expect a culture of absolutely no tolerance for this deplorable behavior," he said, adding that Hagel would soon announce new steps in "ongoing efforts to combat this vile crime."\u000aThe Air Force has come under severe criticism after a general recently tossed out a sexual conviction from a court martial against a fighter pilot, Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkerson.\u000aAnd the Air Force has been reeling from a scandal at its main training center in Lackland, Texas, where more than a dozen training instructors have been accused of misconduct with recruits, including sexual assault.\u000aLawmakers have slammed the Air Force and the broader military over sexual assault cases, saying the Pentagon has failed to come to grips with the problem.\u000a

VNew Delhi:  Four sisters in Uttar Pradesh have suffered burn injuries after two men on a motorcycle threw acid on them as they were returning from school, the police said on Wednesday. One of women is in hospital in Delhi.\u000aThe incident took place in Shamli, around100 km from the national capital, on Tuesday evening when the sisters, three of whom are teachers, were returning home from a government school.\u000a"The victims were walking together when two men on a motorbike made lewd remarks and the man who was riding pillion splashed acid on all of them," Abdul Hammed, senior police officer who is investigating the case said. Mr Hameed said no arrests had been made and the motive behind the crime was unclear.\u000aThe youngest sister, he said, suffered maximum burn injuries and had to be rushed to a hospital in Delhi.\u000aAttacks on women have topped the national agenda since December 2012 when a medical student was assaulted and raped by six men on a moving bus in Delhi. She died two weeks later of her injuries.\u000aPublic anger prompted parliament to toughen sex offence laws including doubling the minimum prison sentence for gang-rape, but lawmakers voted against making acid attacks punishable with life imprisonment.\u000aAcid attackers can be jailed for eight-12 years depending on the injuries inflicted, but the offence is bailable.\u000aActivists have asked that India should regulate the sale of an acid called "Tezaab" which is designed to clean rusted tools but is commonly used in attacks.\u000a

VLondon:\u000aNokia, battling to keep up with Samsung and Apple in the global phone race, lost almost 5 percentage points of market share in the first quarter, research company Gartner said on Tuesday.\u000aOverall global sales figures for mobile phones rose 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, driven by demand for smartphones and strong growth in the Asia Pacific region which helped to offset much weaker sales elsewhere.\u000aOf the different vendors, Samsung took much of the gains, remaining in the No. 1 position with a market share of 23.6 per cent, ahead of Nokia on 14.8 per cent and Apple on 9 per cent. Nokia had held a 19.7 per cent share just a year ago.\u000aThose figures followed a 13 per cent rise in sales by Samsung, a 16 per cent increase by Apple, and a 24 per cent fall by Nokia, compared with the same period last year.\u000aSo-called "smart feature phones" like those in Nokia's Asha range have limited smartphone capabilities such as Internet and email access and touch screens but are cheaper than the likes of Samsung's high-end Galaxy models or Apple's iPhone.\u000aThey are crucial to Nokia's future as it defends its leading market share in emerging economies such as India and Africa, while struggling to keep up in the smartphone race.\u000aWorryingly for Nokia, however, Gartner said that overall sales of the cheaper feature phones were slowing, as consumers kept hold of their phones for longer.\u000a"Nokia's mobile phone share dropped 4.9 percentage points in the first quarter of 2013 mainly due to a steep decline in feature phone sales," said Gartner in its quarterly report on the industry, which is closely watched for moves among vendors.\u000a"Although Nokia's Windows Phone sales have sequentially improved, reaching a volume of 5.1 million units, Nokia is yet to see high growth in the smartphone segment. Nokia's position in the smartphone market dropped to No. 10 in the first quarter of 2013, from No. 8 in the fourth quarter of 2012."\u000aGartner said smartphones accounted for 49.3 per cent of sales of mobile phones globally, up from 44 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012.\u000a"Feature phones users across the world are either finding their existing phones good enough or are waiting for smartphones prices to drop further," said research analyst Anshul Gupta.\u000a"Either way the prospect of longer replacement cycles is certainly not a good news for both vendors and carriers looking to move users forward."\u000a

VLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner speaks during an interview in San Francisco on Feb. 25.\u000aThere are two reasons employees leave companies, said Ken Oehler, the director of the global engagement practice at human resource consulting firm Aon Hewitt: "They're moving away from something unpleasant ... or toward something better."\u000aLinkedIn is concerned about the former scenario.\u000aAfter a disappointing earnings report, a downgrade by analysts, and a stock plunge, the social network lost about half its market value. When companies stumble, the best employees leave. Losing talent is expensive, and an exodus of institutional knowledge is last thing a struggling company needs.\u000aHoping to avoid this phenomenon, Chief Executive Jeff Weiner held an all-hands meeting about a month ago to calm the troops. "We are the same company we were the day before our earnings announcement," he told 9,200 nervous employees. His efforts to keep the company's workforce from bolting didn't stop there: Weiner relinquished his annual $14 million stock bonus to employees.\u000a"Jeff did not receive an equity package this year at his request," a spokesperson told Re/code. "He asked the compensation committee to take the stock package he would have received and put it back in the pool for employees."\u000aThe tactic has become more popular among CEOs leading companies headed into darkness. Jack Dorsey gave Twitter employees $200 million in stock after a rough first couple of weeks as CEO. (Layoffs followed after the company's stock price dwindled.) Aeropostale CEO Julian R. Geiger (former leader of the catastrophe that was Crumbs), gave up 1 million in stock options "solely for the purposes of motivating and retaining other key members of the organization," read a business update from early this year. (Aeropostale has lost almost all its value over the past five years.)\u000aThe hope is that the gesture, the money, or some combination of the two will keep people around. But does it work?\u000a"It doesn't make much of a difference," said Brian Kropp, who heads the HR practice at the Corporate Executive Board. Of course people like money, but the benefits are short-lived. "There's kind of a flurry of talk and activity about it. It doesn't actually sustain," he said. Even $14 million dollars in stock isn't that much divided among almost 10,000 people, and it creates the dangerous expectation of a bonus next year. "A well-written thank you note from a manager has as much of an impact as a cash bonus," said Kropp.\u000aWhat keeps people at their jobs, feast or famine, is perceived career opportunities, research from both Aon Hewitt and CEB has found. "A compelling value proposition is really at the forefront of what makes people stay," said Oehler, citing Aon Hewitt research. "Pay and rewards do have a part in this equation-but it's not everything." People want to see a future with their employer, which is particularly difficult when it's not clear if the employer has a future of its own. Better ways to keep employees from fleeing include giving them interesting projects and challenges, improving their work-life balance, and creating an environment that nurtures work friendships.\u000aThat's not to say the gesture is completely devoid of value. It signals empathy: "I don't think the financial impact [on] the rank-and-file employee is nearly as great as the shared pain that the CEO is trying to communicate," said Jason Wesbecher, chief marketing officer of Mattersight, which sells software to help companies retain workers. Sometimes humanity is the only thing a faltering employer can offer during chaotic times.\u000a© 2016 Bloomberg L.P.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

MLAs would be provided smart cards with talk value valid for a year.\u000aThe move assumes significance in the wake of some members in Karnataka and Gujarat assemblies being caught watching porn on their cellphones during proceedings.\u000aLast year, the mobile phone of DMK MLA TRB Raja, son of party MP TR Baalu was confiscated allegedly for recording house proceedings during a fracas between arch rivals DMK and AIADMK.\u000a

She grabs the bag and walks away from the plane, which was at full stop.\u000aA photo of the airplane on the station's website shows it at the gate, with the slide deployed on the side opposite of the gate.\u000aThe flight, with 159 passengers and six crew members aboard, was from Sacramento to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The airplane, a Boeing 737-900, was briefly taken out of service for maintenance and then was returned to its scheduled use.\u000aThe flight attendant, who was not identified by the airline, has been removed from flying duties.

VNew Delhi:  A lawyer has challenged the contentious Food Security Ordinance in the Supreme Court, terming it as "illegal". The Centre's ambitious welfare programme is now a law after receiving President Pranab Mukherjee's assent on Friday; the scheme provides subsidised food to nearly 800 million or 67 per cent of the population and is being viewed as a major vote-getter in the national elections, due by May.\u000aAdvocate ML Sharma today filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), asking the top court to quash the ordinance. The Congress-led UPA government, which is in a minority, had brought in the executive order earlier this week to clear the food scheme to bypass a debate in Parliament.\u000aThe petition says that an ordinance can be promulgated only in extraordinary circumstances and the current situation certainly didn't warrant the move. Mr Sharma also justified the order as illegal by citing that the monsoon session was barely three weeks away.\u000aThe ordinance must be cleared by Parliament within six weeks of its next seating; sources say this may provoke the government to delay the Monsoon Session.\u000aMr Sharma also contended that the Food Security Bill had already been tabled in Parliament; hence, a move to push it through the ordinance route was aimed at securing political mileage. The bill had been expected to be cleared by Parliament in February, but opposition protests ensured that didn't happen.\u000aOpposition parties led by the BJP have attacked the government for ramming the measure through by decree, saying there has not been enough discussion of its effect on prices and on farmers who must produce more food.\u000aThe populist programme, championed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, will cost R 1.25 lakh crore per year. Critics of the scheme, though, say that the country can ill-afford such a costly subsidy at a time of slowing economic growth and when credit ratings agencies are eyeing the country's large deficit.\u000a

VA top Samsung executive says the company will take a bolder stance in its patent battle with smartphone and tablet rival Apple, which Samsung claims has been "free riding" on its patented wireless technologies.\u000a\u000a"We'll be pursuing our rights for this in a more aggressive way from now on," Lee Younghee, head of global marketing for mobile communications, said Friday in an interview.\u000a\u000aLee, a senior vice president at Samsung, did not say what form the South Korean company's stronger stance would take or if there would be more lawsuits. But her remarks suggest a definite change in tone. She described its previous approach as "passive."\u000a\u000aSo far, Samsung has mostly spoken about the dispute through press releases and comments by anonymous company officials in South Korean and foreign media. The public nature of the comments appeared to back up recent South Korean media speculation the company was planning to go on the offensive.\u000a\u000aThe fight began when Apple sued Samsung in April in the United States, alleging the product design, user interface and packaging of Samsung's Galaxy devices "slavishly copy" the iPhone and iPad.\u000a\u000aSamsung has responded with its own lawsuits accusing Apple of violating its intellectual property. The fight has spread to 10 countries, according to Samsung, including the U.S., South Korea, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.\u000a\u000aThe battle is all the more complex as Apple and Samsung are not only competitors in the fast-growing global market for smartphones and tablet computers, but also have a close business relationship.\u000a\u000aSamsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest manufacturer of memory chips and liquid crystal displays, supplies some of the key components that go into Apple Inc. products.\u000a\u000aLee said that Samsung has kept that relationship in mind amid the dispute with the Cupertino, California-based company, and has largely been pulling its punches.\u000a\u000a"We've been quite respectful and also passive in a way" in consideration of those links, Lee said during the interview in her office at Samsung's headquarters building in southern Seoul. "However, we shouldn't be ... anymore."\u000a\u000aLee said that Samsung holds numerous patents covering wireless telecommunications technology. Samsung says such patents cover key functions including allowing a mobile phone user to speak on the phone and receive an e-mail at the same time.\u000a\u000a"We believe Apple is free riding" on such Samsung patents, Lee said.\u000a\u000aApple reacted to Lee's comments by reiterating its claim Samsung has violated its intellectual property.\u000a\u000a"It is no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging," said Seoul-based spokesman Steve Park. "This kind of blatant copying is wrong and we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas."\u000a\u000aLee's comments came after a German court ruled earlier this month that Samsung cannot directly sell its new Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet in the country, saying the design too closely resembles Apple's iPad 2. Samsung has appealed the decision.\u000a\u000aSamsung ranked No. 2 globally in smartphones behind Apple in the second quarter of this year, according to U.S.-based market research firm IDC, which cited the growing global popularity of the Galaxy S smartphones. In overall mobile phones, Samsung ranks second behind Finland's Nokia Corp.\u000a\u000aThe Suwon, South Korea-based company got a late start in smartphones after Apple shook up the industry with the launch of the iPhone in 2007, but has come on strong.\u000a\u000aLee painted an optimistic portrait of Samsung's future growth and said she believes it can eventually take the No. 1 spot in smartphones and mobile phones.\u000a\u000a"We are striving to continue this growth momentum and someday we can imagine that we can be in the leading position," she said, emphasizing that Samsung has a broad array of hardware, functions, operating systems - Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows and Samsung's own bada - prices and presence in global markets.\u000a\u000a"We are aware of the importance of branding so we'll be reinforcing this Galaxy branding," she said of the Android-based devices.\u000a\u000aRegarding Google Inc.'s proposed $12.5 billion deal to buy mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility, Lee said the plan has not changed Samsung's relationship with the Mountain View, California-based search engine.\u000a\u000a"We still have a very good relationship," she said. "We are working very closely with Google."\u000a\u000aLee joined Samsung in 2007 from French cosmetics maker L'Oreal. Makeup and mobile phones have a lot in common, she said, in that both are focused on individual expression.\u000a\u000aMobile phones, she said, are not just technology, but "a culture and showing who I am, where I belong, how trendy I am."\u000a\u000a© 2011 The Associated Press.

VTokyo: Asian shares firmed on Thursday, encouraged by stronger U.S. economic data and a rise in oil prices, while growing prospects of a U.S. rate hike hit gold and the boosted the dollar to one-month highs versus the yen.\u000aMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.9 percent.\u000aOn Wednesday, U.S. S&P 500 Index gained 0.43 percent, led by banks and energy companies.\u000aU.S. services sector activity recovered sharply in September from six-year low hit in August, following similarly upbeat news from U.S. factories on Monday.\u000a"Both manufacturing and service indexes recovered from big falls in August. While it is not clear what the underlying U.S. economic trend is, given the recovery in Japanese and Chinese surveys the global economic cycle appears to be rebounding for now," said Chotaro Morita, chief bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\u000aRising optimism on the U.S. economy boosted bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.\u000aThe policy-sensitive two-year U.S. note yield hit a four-month high of 0.857 percent with interest rate futures pricing in more than a 60 percent chance the Fed will hike by its December meeting.\u000aThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield also rose to 1.706 percent, compared to around 1.60 percent at the start of week.\u000aThe rise in bond yields partly stemmed from speculation the European Central Bank may eventually taper its bond buying after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday the bank would probably wind down the monthly 80-billion euro ($90 billion) scheme.\u000aEuro zone bond yields have picked up since then, with Germany's 10-year Bund yield rising back to near zero percent from 2 1/2-month low of minus 0.16 percent hit last week.\u000aThe spectre of tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe hit precious metals hard.\u000aGold extended losses after its sharp fall on Tuesday, hitting a 3 1/2-month low of $1,262.2 per ounce. Silver also fell to $17.565 per ounce, its lowest since late June.\u000aIn the currency market, the dollar rose to a one-month high of 103.67 yen and last stood at 103.52 yen.\u000aThe British pound recovered slightly after hitting a three-decade low of $1.2686 on Wednesday on worries about Britain's EU exit. It last traded at $1.2747.\u000aThe euro was little changed at $1.1209, with pressure from concerns about the health of Deutsche Bank offset by speculation about the ECB's tapering.\u000aOil prices rose to their highest since June after the fifth unexpected weekly drawdown in U.S. crude inventories added to support on hopes that major producers will agree to cut output next month.\u000aThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell 3 million barrels last week, well below the build of 2.6 million barrels forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.\u000aInternational benchmark Brent futures rose to as high as $52.09 per barrel on Wednesday, the highest since early June and up almost 6 percent so far this week.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VThe Asia-Pacific smartphone market is expected to double to 200 million by 2016, with Google's Android operating system the leading platform, an industry analyst said Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe growing popularity of the hand held devices, which allow users to surf the Internet and access emails, will mean they will account for almost a third of all mobiles in the region in that time, telecoms consultancy Ovum said.\u000a\u000aAnd despite the continuing success of Apple's iPhone, Ovum added the Android platform will be by far the most used system because it is used in so many devices.\u000a\u000aSmartphones, which numbered 100 million in the region last year, are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 12.5 percent between 2010 and 2016 and make up about 32 percent of all mobiles in Asia-Pacific, according to a statement from Ovum.\u000a\u000aAt the same time global sales are expected to hit 653 million, with Asia-Pacific accounting for 30.7 percent of the total, it said in a statement. More than 288 million smarthphones were sold worldwide in 2010.\u000a\u000a"The smartphone market will see significant growth over the next five years, once again outperforming the wider mobile phone market," said Ovum principal analyst Adam Leach.\u000a\u000a"We will see dramatic shifts in dominance for smartphone software platforms, with Android storming into the lead with 38.7 percent market share, compared to Windows Phone with 22.6 per cent," he said.\u000a\u000aLeach added that Apple's iOS would account for 19 percent of the operating systems used by 2016, followed by BlackBerry's platform with 9.2 percent.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, Android held an 8.9 percent market share, while Apple's iOS had 13.3 percent, BlackBerry's operating system 7.9 percent and Windows Phone 0.15 percent, Ovum data showed.\u000a\u000aLeach said Android's success "is being driven by the sheer number of hardware vendors supporting it at both the high and low ends of the market."\u000a\u000aBut he also said he expects at least one other platform to achieve mainstream success within the forecast period.\u000a\u000a"This could be an existing player in the market such as Bada, WebOS, or MeeGo, or it could be a new entrant to the market place," Leach said.\u000a\u000aThe alliance between Nokia and Microsoft "has redrawn the smartphone market and will result in a significant reduction in shipments of (Nokia's) Symbian-based handsets as Nokia transitions to Windows Phone as its primary smartphone platform," he said.\u000a\u000aNokia in February joined forces with US giant Microsoft in a major strategy shake-up aimed at regaining market share from Apple and Google.\u000a\u000a"For Microsoft the deal provides a committed handset partner that has the potential to make Windows Phone a mainstream smartphone platform," added Leach.\u000a\u000a"The risk to Microsoft is that other handset makers may choose not to compete with Nokia and may turn their backs on Windows Phone."

VNew Delhi:\u000aAsian shares and the euro fell on Friday as investors shunned risk after the European Central Bank took no immediate action and only hinted at future steps to tackle the euro zone's fiscal woes, following similar inaction from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\u000aInvestors also have reasons to be more cautious ahead of a key U.S. non-farm payrolls data for July due at 1230 GMT, with job creation below the 100,000 forecast likely to boost hopes the Fed, which on Wednesday stood pat with its current monetary policy, would embark on further easing as early as next month.\u000aMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 1 per cent after global stocks tumbled on Thursday, but was set for a weekly gain of about 1 per cent.\u000aThe index's materials sector slumped nearly 2 per cent as miners dragged Australian shares lower to rank among the worst performers in Asia with a 1 per cent drop.\u000a"One would expect the risk-off adjustment would likely be involved in the selling of stocks such as miners, whose revenue strengths are more vulnerable to on-going problems in Europe, and the retrenchment of world confidence and so forth," said Ric Spooner, market strategist at CMC Markets, of Australian stocks.\u000aJapan's Nikkei stock average slid 1.6 per cent, hit by heavy quarterly losses and cuts to the full-year earnings outlook from Sharp Corp and Sony Corp.\u000aExpectations for bold actions had run high after ECB President Mario Draghi on Thursday last week vowed to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.\u000aThe ECB, after keeping interest rates steady, indicated it may resume buying government bonds to drive down surging Spanish and Italian borrowing costs, but passed the baton back to euro zone governments by saying they must act first.\u000aBut Draghi said the ECB would consider other "non-standard" measures, hinting at quantitative easing, and by noting signs of an economic recession spreading across the continent left the door open for future rate cuts.\u000a"It was obviously disappointing not to get outright buying of bonds by the Fed and ECB, but it seems they will come and in the case of the ECB, could be unlimited," said Chris Weston, a dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne.\u000aCENTRAL BANKS NOT ALMIGHTY\u000aThe euro hit all-time lows against the Australian and New Zealand dollars in early Asian trade around A$1.1600 and NZ$1.4980 respectively.\u000aThe single currency fell 0.1 per cent against the U.S. dollar to $1.2170, not far from a one-week low of $1.21335 touched after investors digested the ECB's news on Thursday.\u000a"Draghi kept hopes that the ECB will do what it can within the framework of a central bank and that is positive," said Kazuto Uchida, an executive officer and general manager of the global markets division at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\u000a"But concurrently, markets were reminded of the limit to what the central bank can do for Europe's fiscal crisis. There is now risk of repercussions to having an excessive belief that monetary policy or central banks are 'almighty'."\u000aUchida said that the Fed, in contrast, has managed market expectations better to keep relative stability by pricing in further easing stimulus.\u000aWhile European shares fell on Thursday, euro zone bank shares and Spanish stocks were still up following Draghi's pledge last week, while Europe's volatility index fell 6 per cent on Thursday, signalling investors are still willing to take risk.\u000aRisk aversion may also be tamed somewhat as data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week and manufacturers suffered an unexpected drop in orders in June, suggesting the economy is struggling to break out of a soft patch and needs more monetary stimulus.\u000aThe Fed said at this week's meeting that it is prepared to act if the economy deteriorates further, and economists say the U.S. central bank is buying time to lay the groundwork for further monetary easing, possibly at its September 12-13 gathering.\u000aBrent crude added 0.4 per cent at $106.30 a barrel while U.S. crude futures rose 0.4 per cent to $87.50.\u000aData on Friday showed activity in China's services industry slowed in July from June, but still fared far better than the factory sector, with the official purchasing managers' index falling to 55.6 from 56.7 and staying above a 50 reading which signals expansion.\u000aMarket jitters unsettled Asian credit markets, sending the spread on the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment-grade index wider by 4 basis points.\u000aCopyright @Thomson Reuters 2012\u000a

VA BJP leader from Telangana offends and shocks with his statement that Sania Mirza should not be brand ambassador of Telangana, that she's Pakistan's daughter-in-law. The BJP says Sania is India's pride but does there need to be stronger condemnation of the fringe elements?

How could entire panel live in a parallel world? How could everybody pretend so well. What Dr. Laxman said is entirely different from what was attributed to him. Laxman was questioning TRS' hypocrisy - Sania is immaterial. "If Seemandhra people can't become Telangana even if they were born in Telangana, how can Sania who was born in Maharashtra become Telangana Ambassador". Why is this so difficult to understand? WHy is this a WOMAN ISSUE? This is Seemaandhra issue! Is the panel saying "women deserve respect but Seemandhra people don't"? How ignorant and insensitive can you North Indians be? \u000aCitizen | 2 years agoPermalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  @Viswanath: I agree with you because TRS is so anti Seemandhra. As regards Sania she unfortunately is the collateral damage. I think Laxman can politely say sorry to her with a bouquet of flowers. As regarding fringe elements; if BJP and Team Modi have to apologize for every fringe elements remarks than they will have only time to apologize and no time to govern. I think it is time fringe elements are ignored and not given too much publicity which they seek piggy back riding on BJP. Probably BJP needs to Appoint a damage control spokesman publicly rebuke such elements preferably somebody senior and respected by the opposition . \u000aNavkaran | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  Like for congress, Sonia hamari desh ki mata hai, Sania hamari desh ki Bethan hai.\u000a It's politics at its best. Wonder, if we have no talented Indian living in India to receive the brand ambassador or represent a state. \u000aSham | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike (2) Now you all see the true face of BJP and have fun after giving them majority as well all Indian media is responsible for that. \u000aRaj | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  The BJP better be very careful and not let this election win go to its head by supporting such comments, by its members or from collation member.They are becoming arrogant like the congress. People of India do not like this type of behaviour by it's elected officials, remember the aam admi. Today is the middle class, not the ones in the villages.Every job has minimum standard of education, social skills, etc, why not. MP's \u000aAnonymous | 2 years agoReply | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  which antinational in Telengana said that Kashmir and Telengana never part of India. why no FIR? and no debate.is it secular comment? he is danger to national security. \u000aSharath Krishnan | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  What happened to Saina Nehwal?, she won a medal in Olympic which Sania dint,she is yet to get her cash award from the State Government for that feat.\u000a Why was she not considered as brand ambassador? \u000aRao | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  The issue is entirely side tracked and the comments by BJP leader are quoted out of context. The real issue is the nativity rule enforced by Telangana govt. according to which a student has to prove that not only he has to be born in Telangana but also his parents has to be born in Telagana. Because of this stupid rule many students are not eligible for govt tutions reimbursement scheme. According to this rule Sania Mirza is not a local . The question raised by BJP leader is that how come Sania who is not born in Telangana, not living in Telangana since she is married to non telangana guy be eligible to get one crore for being brand ambassador while the students are not eligible. No where was the citizenship issue of sania is questioned, the dual policy of govt is questioned \u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VFile photo of Raghavji\u000aJabalpur:  Madhya Pradesh High Court on Monday granted bail to former state Finance Minister Raghavji, arrested on charges of sexual assault.\u000aThe bail was granted by the court of Justice TK Kaushal on the grounds of old age and health condition, advocate Raghvendra Singh Rathore said.\u000a"The bail plea of Raghavji was opposed by the lawyers as well as the bar association. However, the court granted him bail as the investigation into the case was over and also because of his old age and health problems," he said.\u000a79-year-old Raghavji was arrested from a flat in Bhopal on July 9 after his servant alleged that he was sexually-abused by the minister for nearly three-and-a-half years on the promise of getting him a government job.\u000aThe matter was exposed by the victim by preparing his purported CDs of the alleged sexual act.\u000aAfter the exposure, Raghavji resigned from the Cabinet and was later the expelled by BJP.\u000a

VGoogle TV has just enacted its first programming cancellation.\u000a\u000aThe Consumer Electronics Show next month in Las Vegas was meant to be the great coming-out party for Google's new software for televisions, which adds Web video and other computer smarts to TV sets. Although Google already has a deal with Sony for its Internet TVs, other television makers -- Toshiba, LG Electronics and Sharp -- were prepared to flaunt their versions of the systems.\u000a\u000aBut Google has asked the TV makers to delay their introductions, according to people familiar with the company's plans, so that it can refine the software, which has received a lukewarm reception. The late request caught some of the manufacturers off guard. And it illustrates the struggles Google faces as it tries to expand into the tricky, unfamiliar realm of consumer electronics, and drum up broad interest in a Web-based TV product that consumers want.\u000a\u000aGoogle has a long history of putting out new products and then revising them on the fly. But in the consumer electronics market, companies place big, well-timed bets -- to attract holiday buyers, say, or back-to-school shoppers.\u000a\u000aThis year, for example, computer makers waited for Google's new ChromeOS software so they could ship new types of Web-based laptops. But delays at Google led the manufacturers to miss this year's holiday season.\u000a\u000aGoogle has notched a big win with its Android software for smartphones. But, again, phone and computer makers have been forced to push back their plans to release tablets based on a refined version of the software, leaving Apple's iPad as the tablet king this Christmas.\u000a\u000aNow similar problems may be plaguing Google TV. With its push to improve the lackluster software, Google, like so many companies before it, appears to be confronting the technical challenges that have kept Web TV from becoming mainstream.\u000a\u000aIndustry analysts also say Google's sudden change of plans reflects a weakness in the company's business culture around managing relationships with partners.\u000a\u000a"Google as a company is not a particularly partner-friendly or partner-focused company," said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester, who added that because of the delay, it might take another year before Google TV has a chance to catch fire.\u000a\u000aExecutives at the television makers played down the idea that they were reacting to an abrupt change in marching orders from Google, but according to people familiar with the negotiations, they were caught by surprise.\u000a\u000aGina Weakley, a Google spokeswoman, declined to discuss "rumors and speculation" about unannounced products.\u000a\u000a"Our long-term goal is to collaborate with a broad community of consumer electronics manufacturers to help drive the next-generation TV-watching experience, and we look forward to working with other partners to bring more devices to market in the coming years," Ms. Weakley said.\u000a\u000aUnder Sony's deal with Google, the first Google TVs were shipped in October, starting at $600 for a 24-inch HD flat-screen unit to $1,400 for a 46-inch TV. Sony and Logitech also sell complementary appliances that let people tap into the Google TV software without replacing their televisions.\u000a\u000aSamsung now appears set to be the only new entrant to the Google TV market at the show, where it will present two appliances similar to those from Sony and Logitech, according to people familiar with the company's plan. Vizio will also demonstrate its take on a Google TV, but will do so in private demonstrations off the show floor.\u000a\u000aThe Google TV products on the market are close to full-fledged computers. They run on Intel's Atom chips, most often found in laptops, and can process software common on PCs.\u000a\u000aThe biggest promise of Internet television -- the ability to watch any show or movie at any time, streamed over the Web -- is far from reality with Google TV. People can pay to watch shows or movies on demand using Netflix or Amazon on Google TV, and can watch regular TV programming. The major networks, though, are not providing shows on Google TV, and NBC, CBS, ABC and Hulu have blocked people from watching full-length shows on their Web sites using Google TV.\u000a\u000aGoogle TV offers viewers other things they may not find useful, like watching YouTube videos and showing friends vacation photos on a bigger screen, or monitoring ESPN.com while watching the game and writing Twitter posts about "Mad Men" on the same screen displaying the show.\u000a\u000aGoogle promises to apply its main expertise -- search -- to the TV. Instead of the byzantine cable and DVR programming menus that viewers navigate today, with Google TV, they can search for the name of a show and see when it's being broadcast and where it's available online, in addition to viewing links to Web sites about the show and its actors.\u000a\u000aBut, so far, Google TV is not ready for prime time, according to consumer technology reviewers and some early customers.\u000a\u000aThirty-eight percent of shoppers on Amazon.com gave the Logitech Revue box three stars or fewer, and 19 percent gave it the lowest rating of one star. The main complaints were that it was slow and did not offer more features or programming than other, less expensive set-top boxes.\u000a\u000a"The concept of Google TV is very neat and I'm excited to see where it goes, but the only place my Logitech Revue is going is back to Best Buy," wrote J. DiBella from Palm Coast, Fla.\u000a\u000aThe Google TV software is complex, requiring a remote control that includes a mouse and keyboard. And there are smaller problems, as when the windows to watch TV and browse the Web simultaneously sometimes cover up crucial commands.\u000a\u000aDespite these limitations, the major TV makers were prepared to jump on the Google TV bandwagon. In particular, they hoped to blunt any lead established by Sony.\u000a\u000aNow the TV makers have been asked to hold off on releasing products until Google completes the new version of its software, adding features like an application store.\u000a\u000a"We will not be announcing a Toshiba TV or Blu-ray player or demonstrating the products at CES," said Jeff Barney, the vice president of Toshiba's digital products division. "We have an understanding with Google about the future product roadmap and will bring the right product out at the right timeframe."\u000a\u000aGoogle issued a blog post last week announcing software updates to its TV platform to include better tools for watching movies and TV shows via Netflix and a remote control app built for smartphones running Android software. But the main updates are still to come.\u000a\u000aTo master the consumer electronics game, Google should develop more sophisticated partnership skills and issue polished products, Mr. McQuivey said.\u000a\u000a"Google needs to learn some of those abilities -- both in terms of partnerships with broadcasters and working with hardware partners," he said. "You can give me the recipe for the absolute best chocolate chip cookies in the world, but until I put the ingredients together and bake them at exactly the right temperature for the right time, they're not cookies, and that's where Google TV is."

VMumbai:\u000aGold extended losses to hit its lowest level in ten months on global cues, attracting bargain hunters in the wedding season.\u000aAt 2:51 pm, the most-active gold for June delivery on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) was Rs. 140 lower at Rs. 29,465 per 10 grams, after hitting a low of Rs. 29,357, a level last seen on June 1.\u000aGlobal gold fell for a second straight day to hit its lowest in four weeks, with investors shifting their money into risky assets for better returns on renewed optimism over the US economy.\u000a"Activity is there in the market, physical interest is building up on correction ... market will eye the non-farm payroll data due on Friday," said a dealer with a private bullion importing bank in Mumbai.\u000aIndia, the world's biggest buyer of gold, has been trying to curb imports to put a lid on the record-high current account deficit. The government raised the import duty on gold, which it called a dead investment, by 50 per cent to 6 per cent in January.\u000aFinance Minister P. Chidambaram suggested on Tuesday that the government is unlikely to raise the import tax on gold further to avoid gold smuggling.\u000aHowever, a weak rupee kept the downside limited. The rupee plays an important role in determining the landed cost of the yellow metal, which is quoted in dollars.\u000aSilver for May delivery on the MCX was Rs. 533 lower at Rs. 50,940 per kg.\u000aCopyright @ Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a

VMozilla has rolled out Firefox 23, the new iteration of its web browser for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\u000a\u000aThe new version of the browser is now available through the Firefox.com website. Existing desktop users will also be able to get the update through the browser.\u000a\u000aThe browser now sports a new logo and features a share button that lets users share a web page through a browser based dialog box, without the need to go to another web page. The sharing feature is enabled for Facebook. This is similar to Safari's sharing features, though it supports multiple services. The Firefox feature is based on Mozilla's Social API that makes it easier for web browsers to integrate with social media services.\u000a\u000aThe update also brings a Mixed Content Blocker. According to Mozilla, when secure HTTPS pages load additional content insecurely over HTTP (also known as Mixed Content), users are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. The Mixed Content Blocker blocks insecure active content by default, protecting users from these attacks. Firefox automatically blocks mixed content and displays a shield icon in the address bar.\u000a\u000aFirefox 23 also ships with a Network Monitor tool that allows users to track how long it takes for individual components of a webpage to load.\u000a\u000a- NEW: Mixed content blocking enabled to protects users from man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdroppers on HTTPS pages\u000a\u000a- CHANGED: "Enable JavaScript" preference checkbox has been removed and user-set values will be reset to the default\u000a\u000a- CHANGED: Users can now switch to a new search provider across the entire browser\u000a\u000a- CHANGED: CSP policies using the standard syntax and semantics will now be enforced\u000a\u000a- CHANGED: Replace fixed-ratio audio resampler in webrtc.org capture code with Speex resampler and eliminate pseudo-44000Hz rate\u000a\u000a- CHANGED: "Load images automatically" and Always show the tab bar" checkboxes removed from preferences and reset to defaults\u000a\u000a- DEVELOPER: Write more accessible pages on touch interfaces with new ARIA role for key buttons

VRepresentational picture\u000aNew Delhi:  It is now mandatory for women travelling on two-wheelers, driving or riding pillion, to wear helmets in the national capital.\u000aThe Delhi government issued a notification on Friday inviting objections and suggestions from public within 30 days.\u000aDelhi's Chief Electoral Office had recently given a go-ahead to the state government's plea to implement the decision of making wearing of helmets mandatory for women two-wheeler riders within the city.\u000aThe proposal had already been approved by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung.\u000aAccording to the order, the sub-rule (2) of rule 115 (that exempts women from wearing helmets) in the Delhi motor vehicles rules, 1993 shall be deleted.\u000aThe new rules may be called Delhi motor vehicles (amendment) rules, 2014, the notification said.\u000aAccording to a recent World Health Organization report, India has the highest number of road deaths in a year in the world - 105,725 deaths, followed by China (96,611), the US (42,642) and Russia (35,972).\u000aAccording to the Delhi's transport department, a total 576 two wheeler riders lost their lives in 2012.\u000a"This means two persons who die every day in road accidents are two wheeler riders. In India, during the year 2012, a total number of 35,767 two wheeler riders, many of them women, were killed in road accidents.\u000a"The main risk factor for motorised two wheeler users is non-use of helmets and head injuries are the major cause of death, injury and disability among them," the Transport department officials said.\u000aHowever, Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee and other Sikh organizations had opposed the transport department's move and urged the Lieutenant Governor to review the order in light of their religious sentiments.\u000a"As per the Sikh tenets wearing of caps is not permitted in Sikh religion. Some Sikh women who are Amritdari and have been baptised wear turbans or headgears and it is not possible for them to wear helmets," said Manjit Singh, President of DSGMC in his letter to Najeeb Jung.\u000a

VGeneva:  The humanitarian situation in Syria is now so bad that the Red Cross is struggling to cope, the new head of the international aid agency said on Thursday.\u000a"The humanitarian situation is getting worse despite the scope of the operation increasing," Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told reporters in Geneva.\u000a"We can't cope with the worsening of the situation."\u000aThe ICRC, which works in collaboration with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) to deliver aid in the conflict-wracked country, has "a lot of blank spots" with regard to meeting the needs of the people on the ground, he said.\u000a"There is no doubt the seriousness of the crisis is deepening every day, and this trend has been uninterrupted since the summer," he said.\u000aMr Maurer, who met with President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus in September, said the amount of aid getting into the country had increased following his visit after dipping to a "low level in the summer months" owing to "serious obstacles".\u000aAfter the talks, Damascus had allowed 14 ICRC aid lorries carrying food and medicine to enter the country, Mr Maurer said, adding that the agency had also secured the use of warehouses inside Syria.\u000a"There is an unknown number of people in Syria who do not get the aid they need," Mr Maurer said, adding that the Red Cross had no strategy in the country beyond taking action when and where it could.\u000a"There is no point in planning. You try every day to fill the crack that is opening."\u000aAt the briefing in Geneva, the Red Cross chief described the agency's delivery of aid to Homs on November 4 as "an utterly important achievement."\u000a"But that was only one city," Mr Maurer said, adding that the agency had not gained access to Aleppo "in a while" and could get into other cities such as Idlib "but not far beyond."\u000aMr Maurer said his organisation had "no overall figures, only estimates, suspicions" on the level of need.\u000aHis comments come after a relief group for the war-ravaged country claimed on Wednesday that almost all international aid sent to SARC headquarters in Damascus is being confiscated by the regime and never reaches civilians in need.\u000aThe claim, by the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations, was rejected by the Red Cross and the UN World Food Programme.\u000aMr Maurer meanwhile said the ICRC had access to "some" of the people detained in Syria's some 25 central prisons, but said Damascus had yet to follow through on promises of broader access, including to other kinds of detention centres.\u000aThe conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives since it erupted in March 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, while the United Nations has estimated the number of people in need within Syria at around 1.2 million.\u000aThe UN also estimates that more than 2.5 million people have been affected by the war, with more than 358,000 refugees registered in neighbouring countries and many more unregistered.\u000a

VMadrid:  Spanish King Juan Carlos apologised on Wednesday as he emerged from hospital after breaking his hip on an African elephant hunting trip, which provoked a scandal at home.\u000a"I am very sorry. I made a mistake and it won't happen again. Thank you for your interest," the 74-year-old monarch said during his televised departure from a Madrid hospital.\u000aLooking serious, the king said he was feeling "much better" after the hip replacement performed at the capital's USP San Jose Hospital and was looking forward to resuming his official duties.\u000aDoctors discharged the head of state a few hours earlier, saying in a statement that after a "very satisfactory" recovery since Saturday's operation, Juan Carlos was now able to get around by himself.\u000aThe king, though widely respected for his role in steering the country to democracy after the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, was harshly criticised for his Botswana hunting trip.\u000aMany were angered by the extravagance of the holiday, coming at a time when millions of Spaniards are suffering in recession, and the fact that he was hunting big game.\u000aLeaders of the two main political parties have refrained from explicitly criticising or defending the king.\u000a But newspapers were not so forgiving.\u000aThe conservative daily El Mundo branded the trip "irresponsible" and "inopportune" in an economic crisis.\u000a"The sight of a monarch hunting elephants in Africa when the economic crisis in our country is causing so many problems for Spaniards does not set a good example," it said.\u000aMany papers published a photograph dating to about 2005 of Juan Carlos posing with an elephant during a hunting trip.\u000aAnimal rights groups also protested outside the hospital during the king's convalescence, holding photographs of elephants and baby seals to denounce the trip.\u000aThe Spanish branch of the wildlife charity WWF, which names the king as its honorary president, said this week it would make comments to the royal palace and reiterate its commitment to the conservation of elephants,\u000aA petition on the online forum Actuable listed 40,000 signatures urging the king to give up his presidency of the Spanish WWF.\u000aBotswana authorities confirmed on Monday that Juan Carlos fell and broke his hip during an elephant hunting expedition in the north of the country but said he slipped in his chalet, not in the bush.\u000aJuan Carlos has suffered a troublesome few months marked by an embarrassing corruption scandal implicating his son-in-law, the Duke of Palma, Inaki Urdangarin.\u000a

VMadan Mitra was questioned earlier today in connection with Saradha scam\u000aKolkata:  West Bengal Minister Madan Mitra was arrested on Friday in the Saradha chit fund case, in growing trouble for the government of Mamata Banerjee. He is the first minister and third major leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress to be arrested in the scam, in which lakhs of people were cheated out of their savings.\u000aMr Mitra is known to be one of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's most trusted aides and a founder member of the party.\u000aLast month, after being summoned by the CBI, the minister had checked himself into hospital.\u000aMr Mitra, the state Transport Minister, was seen in video clips praising Saradha Group chairman Sudipto Sen at a meeting of Saradha agents and allegedly enjoyed benefits like a car, fuel and driver at the company's expense. He allegedly also extracted donations out of Sudipto Sen for a temple.\u000aTrinamool leaders said they anticipated this "vindictive move" after BJP president Amit Shah's recent rally in Kolkata. The party has accused the ruling BJP at the Centre of targeting its members after Ms Banerjee attended a Nehru conference organized by the Congress.\u000aReacting to the charge, Mr Shah said, "CBI is doing their work."\u000aThe Saradha Group operated a Ponzi scheme offering massive returns of 40 per cent and more until it collapsed last year, leaving lakhs of small investors bankrupt in West Bengal and Odisha.\u000aWith today's arrest, three of the four leaders that the Chief Minister had strongly defended at a party meeting last year are now in jail. She had asked rhetorically, "Are they thieves? Am I a thief?"\u000aTrinamool lawmakers Srinjoy Bose and Kunal Ghosh were earlier arrested in the multi-crore scam. Rajat Majumdar, a former police officer and Trinamool vice president, was also arrested in August.\u000aIn November, the police said Kunal Ghosh had overdosed on sleeping pills in jail. The lawmaker had threatened in court that he would take his own life if the "real beneficiaries" of the chit fund scam were not arrested. He has alleged that top leaders of his party are being shielded.\u000a

VA rally that's taken India's stock market to record highs faces a reality check as profits at some blue chips have been bolstered by non-operating items such as tax credits and investments, rather than by a revival in demand.\u000aThe reliance on "other income" to pad profits in January-March quarter results reported thus far indicates that an anticipated economic recovery has yet to take hold, and that the current rally may be running ahead of fundamentals.\u000aInvestors have been betting on improving profits. Earnings at 170 large and midcap Indian companies tracked by Thomson Reuters StarMine currently are expected to surge by an average of 17.8 per cent in the fiscal year that started in April, more than double the 7.7 per cent a year earlier.\u000a"Markets would increasingly start looking expensive if earnings don't keep pace with it," said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance in Mumbai.\u000aRecent share-price gains "would be futile unless operating margins and profits follow," he added.\u000aBoth the NSE index, the country's biggest stock exchange, and the BSE Sensex, the oldest, have hit record highs since February.\u000aA market rally for the NSE this year has been driven by bets that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will handily win elections concluding this month, and by hopes that India's economy is on the mend after hitting a decade-low growth pace.\u000aAt this year's peak - on April 23 - the index was up 8.5 per cent. As of Friday, it was 6.2 per cent ahead in 2014.\u000aAnalysts had widely expected core earnings to recover after an analysis of 128 companies in the BSE 200 index showed operating margins fell to 14.7 per cent in the October-December quarter, the lowest since December 2008.\u000aBut those hopes have taken a knock from recent company results.\u000aNO SIGN OF REVIVED DEMAND\u000aOne example is Maruti Suzuki Ltd, India's biggest auto maker. It disappointed investors last month by posting a bigger-than-expected 36 per cent decline in quarterly net profit to Rs. 800 crore.\u000aMaking it worse, half of the entire net profit came from treasury income including investments such as mutual funds. Meanwhile, its sales in April were down 11.4 per cent on a unit basis from a year earlier, hardly a sign of revived demand.\u000aMaruti Suzuki's reliance on non-operating items was much higher than over its previous two fiscal years, when other income accounted for a median of 32 per cent of earnings.\u000aShares of the auto maker - which is 56 per cent owned by Suzuki Motor Corp. of Japan - have fallen 5 per cent since earnings results compared to near 2.1 per cent fall in the NSE index.\u000aEarnings disappointment has been especially acute for infrastructure shares, which had surged because of hopes the sector would benefit most from any economic recovery and will be boosted by a BJP-led government focussing on new investment projects.\u000aMajor cement maker ACC, a unit of Swiss cement maker Holcim Ltd, reported results that some analysts considered less than solid.\u000aThe earnings report showed that non-operating items, including a one-time tax credit, contributed 27 per cent of ACC's net profit, more than a median of 22.7 per cent in the last two years.\u000aOther blue-chips such as Cairn India Ltd and Sesa Sterlite Ltd showed a similar reliance in other income.\u000aFor now, fund managers are willing to wait, given about half of India's blue chips are yet to post quarterly results, and because they are reluctant to miss out on a potential rally should the election outcome due on May 16 show the BJP winning an outright majority.\u000aBut patience is starting to get tested and some investors such as Phani Sekhar, a fund manager at Angel Broking in Mumbai, are looking to book profits.\u000a"If better earnings don't come through or if the election results disappoint, then concerns over the market rally could be magnified by 10 times," Sekhar said.\u000aCopyright Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VCaracas:  Venezuela's opposition said Tuesday it has suspended working group-level talks with the government because of mass arrests of student protesters last week.\u000a"These actions show that the government does not want dialogue, when it has been asked several times to stop this very aggressive position," said Juan Jose Medina, the coordinator of the opposition delegation.\u000a"We're convinced that they are creating a climate that is not conducive to talks," he said.\u000aMedina said the meetings of government-opposition working groups were suspended on Monday.\u000aThe opposition coalition, which goes by the acronym MUD, also was mulling whether to take part in higher level talks Thursday with the government under auspicies of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) and the Vatican, he said.\u000aMore than 200 people were arrested in police raids last week on encampments of protesters in Caracas, a focus of the street demonstrations against the government of President Nicolas Maduro.\u000aMost of those detained have since been freed but the NGO Penal Forum said eight more protesters were arrested Monday night in clashes with police.\u000aMaduro's socialist government and the moderate wing of the Democratic Unity (MUD) opposition coalition established the committees to review the cases of detained opposition leaders and student, and to create a truth commission to investigate protest violence, among other tasks.\u000aMaduro agreed to the face-to-face meetings with the opposition after Unasur offered to mediate.\u000aAt least 42 people have died and more than 800 have been injured since students and other opponents of the socialist government took to the streets in February to protest rampant crime, runaway inflation and shortages of basic goods.\u000a

VAFP image\u000aIslamabad:  Pakistan army helicopters on Tuesday dropped commandos behind the Taliban lines in Swat as security forces stepped up offensive to dislodge militants still holding some of the key towns in Pakistan's troubled northwestern region.\u000aTroops were landed by helicopters at Peochar, a thinly populated hilly area in northern Swat, considered to be the hiding place of Maulana Fazlullah, the commander of the local Taliban.\u000a"The operation is still in progress," a military spokesman said as attack helicopters also bombed Taliban positions in Malam and Jabba, more well-known for their ski slopes.\u000aThis was the first time troops were air-dropped to outflank the Taliban who have fortified houses and buildings, making it difficult for the army to launch a frontal assault on Mingora, the main town of Swat, and other built-up areas.\u000aThe army had used similar operations to wrest Daggar, the main town of Buner, from the Taliban.\u000aNearly 12,000-15,000 armed security personnel are operating in Swat against an estimated 5,000 well-armed Taliban fighters, who still are in occupation of Mingora town.\u000aPrime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had deployed the armed forces last week to eliminate militants who had violated the peace deal in Swat and challenged the writ of his government.\u000aA minister from the North West Frontier Province had said on Monday that about 50 per cent of Mingora's population of about 360,000 had already fled the city due to fighting.\u000aEarlier, Interior Minister Rehman Malik had said that around 700 Taliban fighters had been killed in the fresh offensive against the militants.\u000aThe government launched operations against the militants after they extended their influence from Swat to the nearby districts of Buner and Dir, located about 100 km from Islamabad.\u000a

Was the President talking about people's power to the BJP, Congress and other parties in government when he said 'False promises lead to disillusionment which gives birth to rage.

"I don't believe that Pakistan is responsible for the incident (killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistani army on the LoC in Poonch district) on Tuesday," Mr Singh, the Bihar Agriculture Minister, said.\u000aIssuing notices to the ministers, JD(U) president Sharad Yadav today said the statements are "against the policy, ethics and norms of the party" and asked them to explain within seven days "why disciplinary action should not be taken against you on the above misconduct".\u000aMr Yadav also told the ministers that their remarks had not only "caused embarrassment" to the party but also damaged its reputation.\u000aIn the letter to Bhim Singh, Mr Yadav said, "Your statement regarding army personnel who were killed on the LoC, was uncalled for you being a member of JD(U) and also being a member of the state cabinet."\u000a"Your above act is against disciplinary norms of the party," he said.\u000aIn his letter to Narendra Singh, the JD(U) chief said that his statement that Pakistan government had no hand in the killings was against the party policy, norms and ethics.\u000aHe also reminded the minister that "in this regard I had personally requested you to issue the rebuttal and contradiction to your statement, but it was apparently not done."\u000a

VDiver Philip Chan, dressed as Santa Claus, feeds fish during Christmas at the Singapore aquarium.\u000aSingapore:  A Singaporean diver has died after being struck on the chest by stingray in a closed underwater attraction in the city-state, the aquarium's owners said Wednesday.\u000aVeteran diver Philip Chan, 62, was stung on Tuesday at Underwater World Singapore in a "tragic accident", while readying stingrays for transfer to another aquarium, the attraction's owners Haw Par Corporation said in a statement.\u000aHe later died of his injuries in hospital.\u000aThe incident brought back memories of Australian celebrity conservationist Steve Irwin, who was killed by a stingray barb in the chest in 2006 during a diving expedition off the Great Barrier Reef.\u000aHaw Par said it has suspended the animal transfer programme while police investigations are underway.\u000aThe 25-year-old facility on the resort island of Sentosa shut down in June when it could not keep up with newer attractions on the same island, including a bigger aquarium and water adventure park.\u000aIts pink dolphins, fur seals and otters were moved to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Zhuhai, China, one of the largest marine parks in the world, while its other sea creatures were still looking for new homes, local media reported.\u000aIt is unclear which species of stingray struck Chan in the chest.\u000a Stingrays are commonly found in tropical waters and their barbs, at the end of their tails, are coated in toxic venom which they use to defend themselves when threatened.\u000aWhile the animals' stings are painful, they rarely attack humans.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VThe appeal came as the United Nations is reeling from a wave of sexual abuse allegations blamed on UN peacekeepers serving in missions in Africa.\u000aUnited Nations, United States:  The next United Nations secretary general must commit to a new global deal for refugees and to end the death penalty during his or her tenure, the world's leading human rights groups said today.\u000aAmnesty International, Human Rights Watch and four other groups also said the next UN chief should be prepared to invoke the UN charter to prevent and end mass atrocities such as targeting civilians in wars.\u000aThe eight point agenda by the rights groups was released just as candidates to succeed Ban Ki-moon prepare to address the UN General Assembly to lay out their vision and answer questions, a first in the UN's 70-year history.\u000a"Candidates to lead the United Nations have to stand up for human rights, starting now. They should not fear a backlash for doing so," said Salil Shetty, who heads Amnesty International.\u000aWith Europe facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, the next UN chief must deliver on a new deal for refugees and migrants that includes burden-sharing for resettlement, the groups said.\u000aThe rights activists called for a full review of the bodies that manage international migration.\u000aThe six rights groups urged candidates to promise to work towards abolishing the death penalty during their term after a recent Amnesty report showed that executions worldwide were on the rise.\u000aThe surge was largely fueled by Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but China and the United States also resort to the death penalty.\u000aThe groups urged the candidates to speak out in favor of defending civil society, fighting discrimination, ensuring gender equality and combating impunity by strengthening the International Criminal Court.\u000aThe new secretary general must also be willing to stand up to big powers at the Security Council to discourage them from using their veto power to block action to end atrocities, they said.\u000aRights activists point to the failure by the Security Council in 2014 to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court for war crimes prosecutions as a particular low point in UN diplomacy.\u000aThe measure was blocked by Russia and China, which have veto power.\u000aThe six groups called for "bold and transformative steps to improve the respect for human rights worldwide, leaving no-one behind."\u000aThe appeal came as the United Nations is reeling from a wave of sexual abuse allegations blamed on UN peacekeepers serving in missions in Africa.\u000aThe eight candidates will go to the podium beginning on Tuesday for two-hour sessions that diplomats say are shaping up as a first test of their skills for the top job.\u000aThe human rights agenda was also endorsed by Civicus, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect and the World Federalist Movement - Institute for Global Policy.\u000a

VFile photo of Jacob Zuma\u000aJohannesburg:  South Africa's president said Monday that criminals broke into his rural homestead more than a decade ago and raped his wife, as he sought to explain a $23 million taxpayer-funded security upgrade ahead of elections.\u000aJacob Zuma said the culprits were "arrested, charged, convicted," recounting a previously unpublicised event at his Nkandla homestead in KwaZulu-Natal before he took over as president in 2009.\u000aZuma did not say which of the four wives he had at the time was the victim. One has since committed suicide and he has divorced the African Union chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.\u000aThe 72-year-old has come under fierce criticism over the spending ahead of Wednesday's election. He is expected to win a second five-year term despite the scandal.\u000aA public watchdog in March found the president had unduly benefited from the renovations, which included a swimming pool, helipad and private clinic, and ordered him to pay back part of the costs.\u000a"Why should I be charged for it if some people inflated prices?" he hit back on Monday.\u000aHe said that the issue had been stirred up by the media and by opposition parties.\u000a"People don't think the Nkandla is an issue to affect ANC voters," he said.\u000aA recent snap poll by research firm Pondering Panda showed more than two thirds of young South Africans believe Zuma should resign over the Nkandla scandal.\u000aBut the ANC's anti-apartheid past is likely to be enough to give the party another election landslide.\u000aJoblessness\u000a"We think the ANC will win the elections overwhelmingly, not just, you know, by the skin of its teeth," Zuma told a news conference two days before the May 7 vote.\u000aHigh joblessness and poverty levels, as well as a succession of government corruption scandals, are unlikely to reduce support for the ruling African National Congress, which has won each of the four elections since apartheid ended in 1994.\u000aOfficial figures released Monday showed unemployment had risen to above 25 percent for the first time in almost a year in the first three months of 2014. Unofficial estimates put the figure closer to 40 percent.\u000aBut Zuma emphasised South Africa's progress since the end of white minority rule, especially compared to its African peers.\u000a"All the countries who got independence -- not a single one has been able to deliver in the way that we have delivered," he said, though he acknowledged problems in delivering basic services especially to poor and rural communities.\u000aMany problems were the legacy of apartheid, which had left certain areas underdeveloped and deprived black South Africans of education, he said.\u000aZuma also took a dig at Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu for his criticism of the ANC.\u000a"My understanding is that bishops and pastors are there to pray for those who go wrong, not to enter into political lives," he said, after Tutu last month reiterated he would not vote for the ruling party.\u000aAnglican archbishop emeritus Tutu is widely respected as the country's moral compass, and has grown increasingly vehement in his censure of the ANC in recent years.\u000aHe even supported a group of party stalwarts who called on voters to spoil their vote in protest at the organisation's failings.\u000a"For pastors to say don't vote... I think to me that is a problem. That is entering into a political thing," Zuma said.\u000aThe ANC is expected to garner 63 percent in Wednesday's vote, according to the latest Ipsos poll, just three points less than in 2009.\u000aBut many people are expected to stay away from the ballots, disillusioned with the ruling party but at a loss for a viable political alternative.\u000aThe party wrapped up its election campaign in Soweto township on Sunday. Around 90,000 people gathered for a rally at the same stadium that hosted the 2010 football World Cup Final, though many left during the president's speech.\u000a

VCaracas:  Venezuelans complain that what goes into their Sunday dinner plate comes from abroad: Steak, from Brazil; plantains, the Dominican Republic; rice, South Africa; Parmesan cheese, Uruguay; oats, Chile. Even coffee, in a country famed for it, often is Colombian.\u000aIt's a complaint heard often these days as Hugo Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, seeks election against opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Under the socialist government, shoppers cannot count on finding sugar, cornmeal for Venezuela's beloved arepas and other goods when they go to market.\u000aThose shoppers will be casting ballots Sunday in an election in which food security is a key issue, along with crime and power outages.\u000a"You can't find anything," said Ermis Rodriguez, a 76-year-old retiree who walked away from the chicken legs on offer at a meat stand inside Caracas' bustling Guaicapuro Market. "I voted for Chavez, but I'm not voting for Maduro. Things are getting worse."\u000aChavez, who died March 5, made agrarian reform a pillar of his "revolution" and vowed to turn Venezuela into a self-sufficient, food-exporting power. His government expropriated 2.3 million hectares (5.7 million acres) of farmland over the last 12 years that he said were misused. He nationalized food-producing companies whose owners he claimed were gouging the people, conspiring against his government, or both. For some products such as rice and coffee, the government-controlled market share has ranged from 40 percent to 75 percent.\u000aFor the past seven years, Venezuela, a major oil exporter, has seen sporadic shortages of some basic foods like milk and butter. The country of 30 million people still imports nearly 70 percent of its food. And it has to import products it did not need to before Chavez, including beef, coffee and rice.\u000aWhile Venezuela was nearly self-sufficient in beef 15 years ago, it now imports nearly half the beef it consumes, said Manuel Cipriano, president of the national cattle ranchers' association. The government and some pro-Chavez agricultural groups dispute that figure but still put it at least 30 percent. Last year alone, frozen beef imports increased nearly 150 percent, according to government figures posted on the ranchers' association's website. That has pushed up beef prices.\u000aGerardo Barreto, president of the Chamber of Industry of the central state of Carabobo, said Chavez gutted Venezuela's coffee industry by expropriating its major players, in one stroke diminishing and degrading the product as companies with decades of know-how were replaced by state conglomerates lacking expertise.\u000a"Our coffee used to be excellent. Now it's a coffee worthy of the garbage," he said. "Because it doesn't come prepared or selected. The know-how has been lost."\u000aBarreto said Chavez's expropriation of the seed and fertilizer company Agro Islena had also hurt agricultural production. Fertilizer imported by the government is now more expensive or can't be obtained, he said. "The entire chain of productivity was messed up," he said.\u000aSonia Pena, 50, eyes cuts of Brazilian beef in the Guaicapuro market. "It takes me all day, going from market to market, to get enough to feed my family each week," she said.\u000aCapriles accuses the government of ruining the food market through nationalizations and what he calls ineptitude. He promises to end expropriations and promote dialogue between landowners and farmworkers. He says he will fix Venezuela's deteriorating rural roads, create a micro-lending program for small farms and establish agricultural teaching institutions in every region.\u000aVenezuelan homes will "have refrigerators filled with good food, food made in Venezuela, food made by our farmworkers and not farmworkers from other countries," Capriles vowed during a campaign rally on Sunday.\u000aChavez's proposed plan for his unfinished six-year term had similar proposals, including fixing roads, but the government plans to keep up expropriations.\u000aJose Agustin Campos, president of the pro-government National Confederation of Farmers and Ranchers, defended Chavez's policies at a news conference Tuesday. He said Chavez had reduced interest rates for agricultural loans to help farmers invest and imposed a minimum wage for rural workers on par with urban laborers to encourage the workforce to stay on the farms.\u000aCampos also said dependence on food imports is an old problem that preceded Chavez.\u000aAttempts at agrarian reform in the 1960s sputtered when the government redistributed land but failed to provide the new farmers with the expertise and capital needed to succeed, leading them to produce less. By the time Chavez was elected in 1999, a census had found that 90 percent of farmland given to the poor had returned to large landholders.\u000aChavez had promised not to make the same mistakes, but Venezuela's poor have continued to migrate to the cities; deprived of expertise, many expropriated farms produce less and less. Private food makers, large and small, often sell at a loss because of hundreds of price controls that Chavez imposed in a losing fight against runaway inflation. The government controls the foreign currency they need to buy foreign-made pesticides, fertilizers, animal food and machinery.\u000aMaduro has insisted he will continue Chavez's legacy of state-sponsored supply for the poor. And last Thursday, he injected a new element into the campaign, accusing Venezuela's biggest private food producer, Alimentos Polar, of sabotaging the domestic food market, though he did not elaborate on how.\u000a"Keep up your sabotage of the people's food," Maduro bellowed at a rally in the northern state of Carabobo. "That's OK. Everything in life has its end."\u000aPolar employs about 48,000 people directly and indirectly in its foods division and accounts for roughly 10 percent of domestic food production, including grains, sauces, cheese, canned foods, jam, animal food and other products.\u000aIt issued an unusually strong statement Friday that called Maduro's remarks "threatening" and insisted it is producing at maximum capacity despite a web of government restrictions.\u000aPolar said the government owes it $140 million in US dollars for imports. It said the government decides where its products are shipped, "without taking into account consumer demand." It said the government has disrupted cornmeal inventories throughout Venezuela by demanding that Polar send most of it to Caracas.\u000aPolar added that every food delivery it makes must be approved beforehand by the government. And it noted that official prices for many of its products have not changed in two years despite a recent devaluation of the bolivar currency and estimated inflation of 23 percent. The company said it is losing money on sales of some products, including precooked corn meal, rice, corn oil and pasta.\u000aIn a skewed and often irrational market, the vendors at Guaicapuro do what they can.\u000aDexnmit Gonzalez's family sells chicken and eggs at 50 percent more than official prices. The government-set prices are posted on a board he's flipped around so customers can't see them, but which can be quickly displayed should a price inspector come around.\u000a"Between us," Gonzalez said, "we cannot sell at official prices."\u000aOn Saturday, many shoppers walked away from a display case half-stocked with scrawny chicken breasts. Gonzalez brought out a healthy chicken breast and held it in his palms. "This is very scarce," he said. "Nothing's guaranteed."\u000aAcross the way, Rocky Galviz, 42, sells pig feet, cuts of meat and turkey beneath a sign urging shoppers to denounce price gouging to the "Institute for the Defense of People Seeking Goods and Services." Galviz confides he must sell his Brazilian meat at 50 percent above official prices to make ends meet.\u000aThe government can sell its own imports of Brazilian meat at state prices, Galviz complained.\u000a"That is unfair competition," he said.\u000a

VLondon:  Britain's armed forces will take two years to recover from their involvement in the Olympic Games because the high number of personnel deployed at short notice were taken away from normal duties, the army's chief planner for the Games told the Guardian newspaper.\u000aWing Commander Peter Daulby, who was put in charge of the army's Olympic planning 18 months ago, said the capability to send 18,000 troops to the Games highlighted the danger of "pulling the military down."\u000a"We were originally planning to provide niche capabilities. When the requirement for venue security was doubled, that was a bit of a game changer," Mr Daulby was quoted as saying in the Guardian on Tuesday.\u000a"It will take two years to recover from this, to get back to normal, to get everything back into kilter. You can't expect them to go back to normal routine very easily."\u000aThe Olympics became the largest peacetime operation ever performed by Britain's armed forces after security firm G4S could not supply all of the promised 10,400 guards for the two-week sporting festival.\u000aMr Daulby said the UK's commitment to Afghanistan had not been affected by the Olympics but the military had exceeded by 6,000 the maximum number of people he thought the Ministry of Defence could supply.\u000a"Anything above 18,000 and you start to shut down elements of defence," he said.\u000aA spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the defence contribution to the Olympics had been planned to avoid an impact on current operations.\u000a"While some individual training and leave may need to be rescheduled, this will be managed and will not impact on operations including the ongoing mission in Afghanistan," he said.\u000aBritish Defence Minister Philip Hammond said on Tuesday that G4S's failure to provide enough guards has shown that there were some things only state organisations, such the army, could be relied upon to do.\u000aHammond, currently overseeing the largest overhaul of Britain's armed forces in a generation, said in an interview with the Independent that "the story of G4S and the military rescue is quite informative."\u000aRegular trained members of Britain's army will be cut to 82,000 from 102,000 by 2020 to save money.\u000a

VOn the telethon, Suhel Seth emphasizes the need for corporates to play a much bigger role and take up the cause of the girl child. He felt governments both at Centre and State need to put the cause of the girl child on top priority and there needs to be fast track courts not just for rapes but also for murders of the girl child.

VYSR Congress Party chief Jagan Mohan Reddy with his mother Vijayamma during their dharna in support of United Andhra Pradesh in New Delhi\u000aNew Delhi:  A controversial bill to create Telangana by dividing Andhra Pradesh is likely to set off a political confrontation in Parliament tomorrow with a desperate government determined to push it through, even without a discussion, despite the BJP's warning.\u000aAndhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy may resign tomorrow over the Centre's decision to bifurcate his state; eight of his officials have been given new postings, according to sources.\u000aThe ruling Congress has ordered all its MPs to be present in Parliament this week and sources indicated that the party was all set to push the bill through even without a discussion, if necessary. A three-line whip has been issued to all Congress MPs.\u000aThe BJP has told Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde that the government should not try to pass the Telangana bill in chaos and without the presence of all stakeholders in the house. \u000a"One section of Andhra Pradesh can't be missing," said senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, demanding that 16 MPs suspended for protests against Telangana, including those from the Congress, be allowed in during a discussion on the new state.\u000aThe MPs were suspended after unprecedented violence in Parliament last week. An expelled Congress MP, Lagadapati Rajagopal, used pepper spray on lawmakers in the Lok Sabha and other MPs yanked mics and broke a computer. (MPs shame India, vandalize Parliament)\u000aPoliticians from Seemandhra, or the non-Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh that is strongly opposed to bifurcation, have vowed to stall the bill at all costs. Seemandhra is worried about a smaller share of water, power and revenue from Telangana once the new state is created.\u000aThe BJP's warning to the government came after five central ministers from Andhra Pradesh, including Chiranjeevi, Pallam Raju and Purandeswari, met senior BJP leader LK Advani and urged the main opposition party to oppose the bill.(Live Blog) \u000aJagan Mohan Reddy, who sat on protest in Delhi all day today, also reached out to the BJP. "We will support anyone who helps us keep Andhra Pradesh united and Narendra Modi is not an exception," Mr Reddy told NDTV. (highlights of Jagan Reddy's interview)\u000aEight trainloads of people from Andhra Pradesh, including government employees from Seemandhra, have arrived in Delhi to participate in protests against Telangana. Three key metro stations were shut till evening due to security concerns in the most protected VIP zone in the heart of the city. \u000aThe Centre has five days to pass the bill that will create India's 29th state. The ruling Congress hopes to reap electoral dividends from Telangana in the national election, due by May.\u000aCongress leaders in Seemandhra, including Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy, however fear that the move will decimate the party in the residuary state.\u000a

VWearing a traditional Himachali cap, Mr Negi holds up his ink-stained finger to the camera.\u000aKinnaur, Himachal Pradesh:  In the fruit-laden Himachali district of Kinnaur, the local hero is not named Modi or Gandhi or Kejriwal.\u000aWhite-haired and wrinkled, Shyam Saran Negi arrived at the polling booth today, one kilometer from his home in the hamlet of Kalpa, to the grandest of welcomes. Before he voted, he was presented with a shawl and a garland. With him was his wife Hira Mani, 87.\u000aWearing the traditional Himachali cap, Mr Negi held up his ink-stained finger to the camera. The mark on his index finger, signifying that he voted, is very familiar to Mr Negi. He is independent India's first ever voter, now 97.\u000aShyam Saran Negi's story has a touch of destiny, painted in the brush strokes of history. It is the story of how a little-known school teacher from a little-known village helped to mint a brand new India, 63 years ago.\u000aIn the October of 1951, the threat of a bitter winter and snowy roads allowed Himachal Pradesh to vote some months earlier than the rest of India in the fledgling country's first ever general election. The first Indian to cast his vote in the tehsil of Chini was Shyam Saran Negi, then 34.\u000aSix decades later, Mr Negi hasn't forgotten the emotions that were evoked by that fateful day. "Mujhe aaj bhi who din yaad hain. Woh khushi, woh garv (I still remember that day. The joy, the pride)," he says in a video released by Google urging people to vote.\u000aMr Negi, a committed believer in the democracy he helped construct, has never missed an election since. Now bent by the years and clutching a walking stick, Shyam Saran Negi says neither snow nor rain has ever stopped him from casting his vote.\u000aToday, Mr and Mrs Negi were among the earliest voters at the polling booth. Vote cast, Shyam Saran Negi proudly told reporters "This time again I have not missed an opportunity to cast my valuable vote."\u000aWatch his inspirational story here:\u000aShyam Saran Negi votes in 2014:\u000aPlease download the latest flash player to watch videos.\u000a

VLondon: A selloff in world stocks slowed on Thursday as oil prices steadied at a five-year low and lacklustre demand for virtually- free ECB money stoked expectations the bank will have to resort to full-blown quantitative easing.\u000aBanks borrowed 130 billion euro of four-year loans from the European Central Bank, taking barely more than half of the total money that had been offered this year as the euro zone's economy continues to struggle.\u000aInvestors had seen it as a final throw of the dice before deciding, probably early next year, if it will put aside Germany's concerns and copy the approach of the US, Britain and Japan and start buying government bonds.\u000a"The bottom line is that the disappointing TLTRO (loan) outcome has brought sovereign QE another step closer," said Nick Kounis, head of macro and financial markets research at ABN Amro.\u000a"It now looks close to impossible for the ECB to achieve anywhere near a trillion euro balance sheet expansion with its existing measures."\u000aEuropean shares rose and the euro and government bond yields in the most of the 18-country bloc fell after the result, although the effects were quick to wear off as the cautious market mood returned.\u000aOil saw a 1 per cent rise in Europe, but after another sharp drop on Wednesday and more evidence that Saudi Arabia, the world's top producer, is content to let the slump continue, Middle Eastern stock markets took another lurch lower.\u000aRussia and the battered rouble was back in the firing line too, as a 100 basis point interest rate hike by the central bank failed to eliminate fears that the country is heading for a full-blown financial crisis.\u000aThe bank has now raised rates by a cumulative 500 basis points this year. That is despite a sharp slowdown in economic growth fuelled by worries about oil and Russia's deteriorating relations with the West over Ukraine.\u000a"There is no way this won't be impacting the banks and the corporates," said UBS strategist Manik Narain. "They should send a much more determined signal that they will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes."\u000aDollar dips, oil steadies\u000aFutures prices pointed to a small 0.2 per cent rebound for Wall Street when trading resumes, but after its biggest fall since October on Wednesday and with trading volumes already thinning ahead of the year-end, dealers were subdued.\u000aThe dollar was also starting to backslide again in the currency market. It made small gains against the yen but as it waned against the euro it looked to be heading for a fourth straight day in the red.\u000aDespite the recent volatility displayed by the dollar, the divergence in US monetary policy from Europe and Japan could continue to favour the greenback in the long term.\u000aNew Zealand's central bank governor said he expected to see more central bank money printing next year than both the last two years, despite the US ending its efforts.\u000a"There are question marks around Japan and certainly in Europe," Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler told a media briefing.\u000aThe prospect of ECB QE next year kept German bond yields pinned at record lows, while Greek bonds were also steadier, having been in a tailspin this week after the Greek prime minister decided to bring forward a presidential vote.\u000aBattered oil prices had edged up towards $65 a barrel helped by the weaker US dollar, although prices remained close to a five-year low on signs that already ample supply will be even more plentiful in 2015.\u000aNorth Sea Brent crude rose 63 cents to $64.87, up from Wednesday's low of $63.56 - the weakest since July 2009. US crude, which also hit a five-year low on Wednesday, rose 48 cents to $61.42.\u000aAsian stocks had sagged overnight following on from Wall Street's tumble.\u000aThe volatile Shanghai Composite Index shed earlier gains and fell 0.8 per cent after regulators announced a flood of IPO approvals, while Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit on Monday.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VChristine Lagarde rebuffed any suggestions the IMF was pushing for crisis in Greece. (File Photo)\u000aWashington:  International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde on Sunday told Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that "we are still a good distance away" in negotiations for a new deal for hard-up Athens.\u000aHer strongly worded letter to the prime minister, made public by the IMF, comes amid tense ties between Athens and the IMF after WikiLeaks said the lender sought a crisis "event" to push the indebted nation into concluding talks over its reforms.\u000a"My view of the ongoing negotiations is that we are still a good distance away from having a coherent program that I can present to our Executive Board," Lagarde wrote, in unusually forceful terms, after Tsipras wrote to her in the wake of the WikiLeaks allegations.\u000a"I have on many occasions stressed that we can only support a program that is credible and based on realistic assumptions, and that delivers on its objective of setting Greece on a path of robust growth while gradually restoring debt sustainability."\u000aThe Greek government on Saturday reacted strongly to the WikiLeaks report, saying it wanted the IMF to clarify its position.\u000aLagarde rebuffed any suggestions the IMF was pushing for crisis in Greece.\u000a"The IMF conducts its negotiations in good faith, not by way of threats, and we do not communicate through leaks," IMF managing director Lagarde said in her letter, adding that she was releasing the details of the text "to further enhance the transparency of our dialogue."\u000a"I also look forward to any personal conversation with you on how to take the discussions forward," she added.\u000aIn July, Greece accepted a three-year, 86-billion-euro ($94 billion) European Union bailout that saved it from crashing out of the eurozone. But the bailout came with strict conditions such as fresh tax cuts and pay cuts.\u000aThe IMF worked with the EU on two previous bailouts for Greece since 2010 but the Washington-based lender said it would not participate in the third rescue plan without credible reforms and an EU agreement to ease Greece's debt burden.\u000aAthens is under pressure to address the large number of non-performing loans burdening Greek banks and to push forward with a pension and tax overhaul resisted by farmers and white-collar staff.\u000a'Stalling Tactics?'\u000aTsipras has accused the IMF of employing "stalling tactics" and "arbitrary" estimates to delay a reforms review crucial to unlock further bailout cash.\u000aMission chiefs from Greece's international lenders -- the EU, IMF, European Central Bank and European rescue fund -- are due to resume an audit of the reforms on Monday.\u000a"I agree with you that successful negotiations are built on mutual trust, and this weekend's incident has made me concerned as to whether we can indeed achieve progress in a climate of extreme sensitivity to statements of either side," Lagarde wrote.\u000a"On reflection, however, I have decided to allow our team to return to Athens to continue the discussions," she added, stressing that "it is critical that your authorities ensure an environment that respects the privacy of their internal discussions and take all necessary steps to guarantee their personal safety."\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VIf you're using iOS 8 then sharing from apps has become a lot simpler. Earlier, you could only share links and images to Facebook Twitter and Apple's default apps. Sending a link from Safari to Pocket (for example) meant copying the link, and then closing Safari and launching Pocket, and finally adding the link. Similarly, if you had been using a third-party password manager app, you would have had to open the app, copy your password and paste it in your browser.\u000a\u000aAll of those cumbersome steps are no longer necessary. As long as the app you're using supports iOS 8 extensions, sharing will seem much easier.\u000a\u000aUnderstanding extensionsBefore you start sharing, take a moment to read about the different kinds of extensions on iOS 8. Primarily, there are four types of extensions in the OS.\u000a\u000a1.Photo extensionsThese appear in the Photos app and let you share photos and videos directly to third-party apps.\u000a\u000a2.Share SheetsApps that support share sheets will let you share photos, videos and links to other apps. Safari browser supports share sheets and Chrome has added it too.\u000a\u000a3. Action extensionsWhen you tap the share button in Safari, you'll see two rows of icons. The first row is for share sheets, while the second is for action extensions. Actions were limited to Print, Copy and Bookmark, but now include third party apps. Unlike a Share sheet, where the browser is sharing content, Actions let the third party app "send" information to your browser. This is where, for example, you can use 1password to automatically enter your passwords while browsing the Web.\u000a\u000a4. Interactive notifications and widgetsInteractive notifications let you reply to text messages or calendar invites from the lock screen or a tiny banner at the top of the screen. You don't have to do anything to enable these - it's up to apps to enable support for this. Widgets show you updates quickly in the Notification Centre. We've covered how to enable widgets in iOS 8 and written about our favourite iOS 8 widgets as well.\u000a\u000aNow that you know about the different types of extensions, here's how to enable them.\u000a\u000aPhoto extensionsWant to edit photos using third-party apps? You can do this quickly through the Photos app itself. Here's how.\u000a\u000a1. Open the Photos app and open any photo.\u000a\u000a3. Now tap the three dots icon at the top-left.\u000a\u000a4. Tap More in the pop-up.\u000a\u000a5. Now you'll see a list of installed apps that support photo extensions. Each app will have an on/off switch next to it, so switch on the extensions you want to enable.\u000a\u000a6. You can also drag the three horizontal lines next to the switch to change the order in which these extensions show up.\u000a\u000aNow these extensions will show up everytime you tap Edit and hit the three dots icon after opening any photo.\u000a\u000aShare SheetsShare Sheets let you share data with third-party apps. Here's how to use them.\u000a\u000a1. Open Safari and open any website.\u000a\u000a3. In the first row of icons, swipe to the end of the list and tap More.\u000a\u000a4. A list of installed apps that support Share Sheets will show up here. Slide the on/off switches and tap the three horizontal lines icon to re-order them.\u000a\u000a5. Tap Done when you've set it up.\u000a\u000a6. Now tap the share button in Safari to see the extensions you enabled.\u000a\u000aAction extensionsPassword manager apps are making the most of this feature. Here's how to enable it.\u000a\u000a1. Open Safari and head to any website.\u000a\u000a2. Tap the share button and swipe left in the second row of icons.\u000a\u000a3. Swipe to the end of the list and tap More.\u000a\u000a4. Now installed apps that support action extensions will appear in a list.\u000a\u000a5. Use the on/off switches to enable or disable these. Again, drag the three horizontal lines icon to rearrange the extensions.\u000a\u000a7. Now go back to Safari and tap share to see these extensions appear in the second row. Password manager apps use this to let you enter passwords quickly on any website.\u000a\u000aAs of now, one problem with extensions is that none of the apps remember the order in which you want these extensions. We noticed that the extensions always seemed to reset to the default order, no matter how many times we changed the order. This bug will hopefully be fixed soon, but it doesn't affect the extensions' functionality, and enabled extensions remain on, which is more important anyway.\u000a\u000aWe hope you've managed to configure extensions on your iOS device.

VUday Chopra, Abhishek Bachchan, Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif in a poster from the movie\u000aAs Dhoom: 3 readies to make its stylised entry at the Indian box office this Friday, it seems that it will not just impact audiences visually but financially as well.\u000aIf that is not enough, the film is expected to make waves in Pakistan too.\u000aAs the film's release draws closer, the IMAX screens have set their prices at Rs 400-600 for the morning shows and Rs 700-900 for the night shows, according to their official website. \u000a For a family of five, watching Dhoom: 3 could thus mean an expenditure of Rs 4,500, sans any coke and popcorn!\u000aThe prices might seem extravagant and uneconomical for a middle class family but advance booking status on the website shows that the seats are filling up fast and have even been sold out at places.\u000aThis might be the status for IMAX screens but others are keeping the ticket price affordable. The cost of tickets in multiplexes ranges between Rs 300-Rs 400.\u000aThe prices in New Delhi seem to be lesser than those in Mumbai and range between Rs 200-Rs 250, with the exception of a few theatres where the prices have gone upto Rs 500.\u000aSmaller cities like Chandigarh and Jaipur fall in the average price range of Rs 150-Rs 400. However, there are also places like the Gaiety Galaxy theatre in Bandra here where you can enjoy Aamir Khan's grey character in the action thriller at reasonable rates.\u000a"All the theatres might have been taking advantage of the release of Dhoom: 3, but we at Gaiety Galaxy have made it a point to not increase the rate. Our ticket prices remain consistent at Rs 70-Rs 90," said Manoj Desai of Gaiety Galaxy. Desai added that the weekend is already pre-booked and he is expecting an identical pattern in the following week as well.\u000aProduced under the Yash Raj Films (YRF) banner and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, the film boasts of a starry cast with Aamir in a new role - he will be seen as a gymnast.\u000aAbhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra will reprise their roles of Jai Dixit and Ali from the last two Dhoom movies and Katrina Kaif will enhance the glamour quotient as the female lead in the movie, which will be Bollywood's first film to be released in the IMAX format, a specialised film format.\u000aThe 2D film is already being appreciated for the stunts featured in the trailer and especially the bike scenes featuring Aamir. Trade analyst Amod Mehra predicts that the film will surpass the collections of previous blockbusters. "Reality check. Mark my words Dhoom: 3 will cross Rs 100 crore in the first three days and it will also cross Rs 200 crore in the first seven days," Mehra said in post on Twitter on Wednesday.\u000aRaising the bar of pre-release promotions, the makers have also come up with innovative advertisements with tag lines reading - "It's Dhoom day. Are you bunking college today".\u000aNot only is the film expected to flourish in India, it will also see a release in Pakistan.\u000a

VDespite their anger, many PDVSA workers say they are scared to protest.\u000aMaracaibo, Venezuela:  For decades, jobs at Venezuela's state-run oil giant PDVSA were coveted for above average salaries, generous benefits and cheap credit that brought home ownership and vacationing abroad within reach for many workers.\u000aNow, in Venezuela's asphyxiating economy, even PDVSA employees are struggling to pay for everything from food and bus rides to school fees as triple-digit inflation eats away incomes.\u000aThey are pawning goods, maxing out credit cards, taking side jobs, and even selling PDVSA uniforms to buy food, according to Reuters' interviews with two dozen workers, family members, and union leaders.\u000a"Every day a PDVSA worker comes to sell his overall," said Elmer, a hawker at the biggest market in the oil city of Maracaibo, as shoppers eyed pricey rice and flour imported from neighboring Colombia.\u000a"They also sell boots, trousers, gloves and masks."\u000aThe bulk of PDVSA's roughly 150,000 workers make from $35 to $150 a month plus some $90 dollars in food tickets, as calculated at the black market exchange rate. It is still more than many Venezuelans, but not enough, employees say.\u000a"Sometimes we let the kids sleep in until noon to save on breakfast," said a maintenance worker who works on the shores of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela's traditional oil-producing area near the Colombian border. He said he has lost five kilos (11 lb) this year because of scrimping on food.\u000aThe toll of the economic crisis is fueling worker disillusionment, absenteeism, and a brain drain and is hurting efficiency in the industry which produces more than 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue.\u000a"Most of us aren't as productive as we used to be, because we're more focused on how to survive economically," said the maintenance worker, speaking on condition of anonymity as he said he feared reprisals.\u000aThat adds to a wide array of problems caused by a cash shortfall - from underinvestment and part shortages to poor maintenance, theft and insufficient imports for blending.\u000aAs a result, the OPEC member's oil output tumbled this year, dealing another blow to the unpopular government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, already under pressure due to low international oil prices.\u000aPDVSA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this story, says its employees are happy and state television regularly shows crowds of cheering PDVSA workers in red overalls. The company talks of a right-wing media campaign to discredit late leader Hugo Chavez's "21st century Socialism."\u000a"While PDVSA does not escape the (oil) price situation, its workforce remains intact and ready to generate initiatives to boost major projects," it said recently.\u000aBartering To Eat\u000aIn Ciudad Ojeda, a hot oil town that hugs the shores of Lake Maracaibo, food lines and shuttered shops dot the city of roughly 92,000 and, for the first time, the opposition-led mayor's office is organizing soup kitchens.\u000aA former PDVSA worker, who quit earlier this year because he could earn more driving a taxi, said that over the past months he sold four overalls and one pair of boots to feed his three children. He bartered another pair of boots for meat. He also sold his furniture, including his dining table, to buy food.\u000aFurther north at the massive Paraguana refining center, a mechanic and a father of two, recently offloaded new boots for roughly $7 - "cheap, so I could sell quickly and get food."\u000aDespite their anger, workers say they are scared to protest.\u000aSince Chavez opponents tried to oust him by shutting down the oil industry in a months-long strike that started in 2002, stoppages are considered sabotage.\u000aOil workers duck out of work to stand in food lines, and people at the Petrocedeno oil upgrader in eastern Venezuela say rowdy company cafeteria queues now start an hour before lunch as workers jostle before food runs out.\u000aMaduro blames these shortages on US-backed businessmen he says are hoarding products to torpedo his government, an argument that still resounds with some workers.\u000a"The situation is tough because of the 'economic war'," said PDVSA cook Moraima Reyes in Paraguana. "That's why we're defending the revolution more than ever."\u000aBut many speak of leaving PDVSA or Venezuela altogether, joining a brain drain that has seen professionals flock to Colombia, Spain or Panama.\u000a"What's the point of working? It's impossible to have a good quality of life," a former automation specialist at PDVSA said in a phone interview. Last year he moved to the United States, where he has to hold several jobs, including in a restaurant and a car dealership.\u000a"I have no regrets. Whatever it takes to escape Venezuela's communism."\u000a

VAjay Devgn's Himmatwala turned out to be a box office dud.\u000aAjay Devgn was almost having a dream run at the box office that was abruptly brought to a halt thanks to Sajid Khan's Himmatwala.\u000aWhile his previous films Singham, Bol Bachchan and Son of Sardaar raked in some pretty impressive moolah, his film with Sajid sank without a trace. Now word is that Ajay has asked director Rohit Shetty to speed up on the work on their next film Singham 2, apparently to leave behind the bitter memories of his recent release.\u000aAn industry insider says, "This was the first time Ajay had stepped out of his comfort zone of working with directors like Rohit Shetty, Prakash Jha or Ashwini Dhar to join hands with Sajid. He is extremely disappointed with the film's results." \u000a Another source close to the actor adds, "Ajay wants to restore his lost glory at the box office and has asked his trusted aide Rohit to speed up things on their next. They have done nine films together out of which eight have been hits."\u000a

VA new exhibition highlights chefs' ideas about avoiding waste, including dishes such as mackerel scratchings and bin-end pilaff\u000aWaste is the most pressing problem in modern food (unless you don't have enough of it - but that's another post). Home cooks are endlessly lectured about cutting back the 30% of usable food we are said to throw away. The government-backed Wrap agency, with its Love Food, Hate Waste campaign, has been at the job for 14 years. Now the supermarkets are issuing their own finger-wagging advice (which is sort of hypocritical, because it is in food production and retail that most waste occurs). Tesco admitted recently that it throws away 30,000 tonnes of food a year - including a third of all the bags of salad it puts on sale.\u000aAt the restaurant level it is all rather different. For a start, food is a relatively minor expense compared with staff costs and premises. The more high-end restaurants make little, if any, money on their food; the profit is in alcohol. Good restaurants order ingredients according to what the bookings and experience dictates, and managers hold chefs to account if they have overdone the buying.\u000aSo avoiding waste becomes more of an issue of pride and morality - that, at least, is the attitude of five big-name chefs who have contributed ideas to a photo exhibition and conference being held in London this week by the Sustainable Restaurant Association and the Dutch embassy.\u000aThe results are dishes of ugly fish, wonky carrots as served at Grain Store, mackerel scratchings, prawn heads, cuttlefish testicles prized by chef Peter Weeden and some of the far extremities of farm animals. Wahaca's Thomasina Miers came up with dishes to make the most of Sunday roast leftovers, and Henry Dimbleby made a "bin-end pilaff".\u000aLast month I watched two Michelin-starred Andrew Fairlie working in his kitchen at the Gleneagles hotel. "Using the whole beast is a great way to cook," he said, pulling out a bucket of pink pigs' tails. "It's cost effective. Buying local? Using the whole beast? It drives me mad when people boast about these things. Any self-respecting chef should be buying local and using as much of the animal as possible."\u000aFairlie cooked us his glorious "pig bits" signature dish. It is a celebration of the far ends of the animal, so often discarded in Britain, though not in more sensible places such as Thailand or China. On the plate you get a series of intriguing riffs - roulade of head, confited and smoked pork belly, crispy pig's tail, creamy boudin noir - served with crispy bacon, jus, tarragon mustard and caramelised apple. "We're using every bit of the pig except the bones."\u000aThis parade appears on the menu simply as assiette de porc. It has been a favourite since Fairlie opened his restaurant at Gleneagles 13 years ago, outselling every other main course. Over the years, the only change is that the medallion of pork loin was dropped. Customers wanted the odd bits.\u000aIn the kitchen, we watch Fairlie's chefs prepare the different elements of the dish. It is time-consuming. "Most of the expense is the labour," he says. But the ingredients are insanely cheap. Pig heads are just 50p each. The big bucket of pigs' tails were free from the supplier. From that bucket and six heads will come as many as 140 portions, the main part of a dish selling for more than £20. You'd have thought the economics of that might inspire a canny restaurateur - but, of course, there are some fine old-fashioned skills needed.\u000a"The young chefs need to be taught. We had this young guy, 26 or so, he's worked in some great restaurants but this was the first time he'd seen a whole pig's head. He was so excited. Boning a pig's head is an amazing skill.\u000a"Chefs have to understand the anatomy of the animal. It drives me nuts when you see people chucking the head of a beast away. Go to the farm, meet the farmer, see what he goes through. You wouldn't toss good food away again."\u000aCampaigner and author Tristram Stuart sees tackling food waste as a global crusade. "We, the people, do have the power to stop the tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food."\u000aHe quotes the recent report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which estimated that 30-50% of the 4bn tonnes of food produced globally each year never reaches a human stomach due to "poor practices in harvesting, storage and transportation, as well as market and consumer wastage". Even a partial solution would go a long way to solving the problem of feeding the nine billion people expected to inhabit the earth by 2050.\u000aHow to get started: ask your butcher for a pig's head and do this, with advice from St John's Fergus Henderson. Sourcing cuttlefish testicles may be a little harder.\u000aPhoto: Chef Andrew Fairlie bones a pig's head. Photograph: Marco Kesseler\u000a

VNew Delhi:  Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily today said the Congress would not protect anybody and the law would take its own course on senior party leader Jagdish Tytler in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.\u000a"Our heart goes out to the victims. We are not here to protect anybody. The law will take its own course," Mr Moily told reporters here, while noting that the Congress leadership had owned up "moral responsibility" as far back as in 1985-86 itself on the anti-Sikh riots issue.\u000aMr Moily, however, said the allegation against Mr Tytler was not "as serious" as against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi who had not taken a single step "to come clean" on the 2002 riots in Gujarat.\u000aMr Tytler had suffered a setback when a 29-year-old anti-Sikh riots case came back to haunt him with a Delhi court setting aside CBI's closure report giving him a clean chit and ordering reopening of probe into the killing of three persons.\u000aIn its order on Wednesday, the court had also faulted CBI for not examining the available witnesses.\u000a

Because of this it's easier than ever to do things like apply for a passport or get a copy of your Aadhaar card. Since these digital services are new, people don't always know how to make use of them, but we're here to help. This week, we're going to show you how to file a Right to Information (RTI) application online.\u000a\u000aThe Right to Information Act 2005 makes it mandatory for the Indian government to issue a timely response to citizens' requests for information in the public domain. Filing an RTI application is a very simple process unlike most other requests to the government. You can easily file an RTI application online, but you need to know a few details to do so.\u000a\u000aFor one thing, you can't file an RTI application for certain kinds of information such as matters concerning national security or if the data you seek could compromise someone's safety or privacy. You can find the full list of information you can't request here. The Right to Information is powerful, and these restrictions are in place to ensure that it isn't misused.\u000a\u000aThe other important thing about filing an RTI plea online is that you need to submit it to the correct authorities. There are different RTI authorities for Central and state governments, and you will have to send your query to the correct department as well. RTI applications for State Authorities will be rejected, but according to the website, if your application is sent to the wrong Public authority in the Central government, it can be transferred to the correct authority by the nodal officer. The full government guide to RTI is available here.\u000a\u000aThe following steps will tell you how to file an RTI plea online in just few minutes This guide focuses on sending an RTI application to Central government bodies. Not all state government bodies let you file an RTI application online yet - on most of the state's sites, you can just download the forms.\u000a\u000aHere's how to file the application with the Central Government.\u000a\u000a1. Go to the RTI website and click on Submit Request. Alternatively, click to go to the RTI application page, here.\u000a\u000a2. Check I have read and understood the above guidelines and click Submit.\u000a\u000aYou can now begin filling in the form for submitting an RTI application. Pick the correct Ministry and department and fill in your contact details. You have to enter your email id to complete the application, but if you want SMS alerts about the status of your application, then you can also enter your mobile phone number.\u000a\u000aIf you don't know the public authority to file your application with, use the search bar on top - it will help choose the ministry/ department and public authority.\u000a\u000a3. You have to fill the entire form - so for example, even if you are not below the poverty line, you need to choose the correct option from the drop down menu. Click the menu, and select No (or Yes, if applicable - this waives the fee for submitting the plea).\u000a\u000a4. Next to Text for RTI Request application, you can write your RTI request. This form limits you to 3,000 characters.\u000a\u000a5. If your request exceeds 3,000 characters, or if you need to submit documents to support the application, click Choose File next to Supporting document. You can upload a pdf file up to 1MB in size with your plea.\u000a\u000a6. Enter the characters in the image next to Enter security code.\u000a\u000a8. The fee for submitting an RTI application is Rs. 10. You can pay that via credit/debit card or net banking on the next page.\u000a\u000a9. Once you've paid, you will be shown an acknowledgement with a unique registration number for your RTI plea. This will be sent to you via SMS and email as well.\u000a\u000a10.

VNew Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to lower policy rates by 50 basis points in 2015 with the first rate cut likely as early as February next year on the back of slowing inflation, global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley said.\u000aThe report said the magnitude of rate cuts would depend on the trajectory of inflation, which is expected to reach 6 per cent level on a sustained basis by March 2015.\u000a"In our base case, we expect inflation to reach the 6 per cent level on a sustained basis by March 2015 (same as the RBI's expectation). We therefore assume 50 basis points policy rate cuts in 2015 in our base case," Morgan Stanley said in a research note.\u000a"We believe that the first rate cut is likely to be in February / March 2015," the report added.\u000aIn terms of magnitude of rate cuts, Morgan Stanley expects 50-100 basis points of policy rate cuts in 2015, depending on the inflation trajectory, which in turn will be dependent on the trend in commodity prices, fiscal deficit and rural wage growth.\u000aThe upside and downside risks to these forecasts would be influenced by two key factors: the pace of policy actions to revive productivity dynamic and the strength of external demand recovery, it said.\u000aAt the December 2 monetary policy review, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan chose to hold rates, saying it is premature to go in for a cut at the moment, but held out hope of a cut if inflation falls.\u000aOn economic growth, the report said GDP growth on a quarterly basis is expected to accelerate from the current pace of 5.3 per cent for the quarter ended September 30, to 7.3 per cent in the March quarter of 2017.\u000a

VA crashed military plane is pictured in Oum El Bouaghi province, about 500km from the capital Algiers. Photo credit: Reuters\u000aOum El Bouaghi, Algeria:  Algerian search teams recovered one of the black box flight recorders of a military plane on Wednesday in their quest for clues to why it crashed killing all but one of 78 people on board.\u000aAlgerians began three days of mourning for the dead from the crash of the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft in the mountainous Oum El Bouaghi region of the northeast on Tuesday -- the country's worst air disaster in a decade.\u000aOfficials said one seriously injured survivor was found in the wreckage.\u000aThe remainder of the 74 passengers and four crew were all killed when the plane came down in bad weather.\u000aA source close to the specialist search teams said they had located the black box flight recorder, which was in "good condition," the national APS news agency reported.\u000aThe plane had plummeted "nose first" before hitting the ground, the source said, adding that it would have been contending with strong winds and poor visibility.\u000aEmergency services chief Mustapha Lahbiri said search teams had been scouring the snowy and rugged area with sniffer dogs since early morning.\u000aThe male survivor, who was in a "critical" condition after suffering serious head injuries, was being treated in a military hospital in the city of Constantine, east of the capital, where the plane had been headed.\u000aBereaved families arrived at the same Constantine hospital throughout the day to collect their loved ones' remains.\u000aAmong the dead were the wife and daughter of a senior military officer, the defence ministry said.\u000aThe plane was flying from the desert garrison town of Tamanrasset in the deep south to Constantine, 320 kilometres (200 miles) east of Algiers, and lost contact with the control tower as it was preparing to make its descent.\u000aAlgerian television broadcast images of the crash scene showing the broken carcass of the aircraft lying in a mountainous snowy landscape, at an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000 feet).\u000a"School notebooks and military duffle bags were also visible at the site of the crash," a source at the scene of the crash told AFP.\u000a- Hercules 'normally extremely reliable' -\u000a"Very bad weather conditions, involving a storm and heavy snowfall, were behind the crash," the defence ministry had said on Tuesday.\u000a"A commission of inquiry has been created and sent to the scene to determine the causes and exact circumstances of this tragic accident," it added.\u000aFlight specialist Kaddouche Maamar, quoted by Algerian daily El Watan, said the airport in Constantine is particularly difficult because of the high surrounding terrain.\u000aHe said that Hercules aircraft were normally extremely reliable, adding: "We can never eliminate all the risks linked to a crash."\u000aAnother Algerian newspaper, El Khabar, quoted a security source as saying the pilot had contacted an air base in Oum El Bouaghi several minutes before the crash, requesting clearance for an emergency landing.\u000aPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced three days of national mourning beginning on Wednesday, praising the soldiers who perished in the crash as "martyrs".\u000a"It is a painful test for the Algerian people, who have just lost some of their brave and loyal children" as they were returning home, Bouteflika said in a letter of condolence to the families of the dead.\u000aTamanrasset, where the flight originated, lies in Algeria's far south near the border with Mali, and is the main base for the country's southern military operations.\u000aIt is 1,500 kilometres (950 miles) from Constantine, and was the site of Algeria's worst air disaster in March 2003, when an Air Algerie passenger plane crashed on takeoff after an engine caught fire, killing all but one of the 103 people on board.\u000aThe same year, another C-130 crashed in a residential Algiers neighbourhood, killing 20 people -- four crew members, eight passengers and eight people on the ground.\u000a

VLucknow:  Lucknow's landscape of crumbling palatial buildings and gardens, inspired by nawabi fantasies and British nostalgia now includes monuments like the Parivartan Chowk and Ambedkar park but for many, Ram Advani's bookshop, tucked away in a corner of Hazrat Ganj has always been the most important jewel in the city's crown since it opened in 1948.\u000aAs we enter the final phase of elections 2014, all eyes are on battle ground UP Including Ram Advani, a man who has seen political fortunes make and break in the Hindi heartland from 1952 onwards, when independent India voted for the first time\u000aIn those early years some of Ram Advani's more regular customers were the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Dr Govind Ballabh Pant, Sucheta Kripalani and Dr Sampoornanand. Jawaharlal Nehru also visited the shop soon after it opened inside the Gandhi Ashram and bought two books, one by the English poet and literary critic, Herbert Read.\u000aRam Advani's father migrated to Lucknow from Karachi in the 1920s. The family owned a chain of book stores where the young man found his calling. After his Master's degree, he decided to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and become a bookseller rather than a teacher. He went to Rawalpindi to see his grandfather's book stores and was hugely influenced by the humility of the authors and literati he met there. He realized there was something in bookselling worth thinking about.\u000aThe shop moved to its present location in Hazrat Ganj in 1951. At the time the building also housed the British and American libraries, Kwality restaurant which served the finest cakes and pastries and the popular Mayfair theatre, a favourite haunt of the British historian, Perciveal Spear and the legendary ghazal singer, Begum Akhtar.\u000aWith the passage of time Lucknow's genteel ways lost out to the impatience and aspirations of a brash new India which had less time for books, while the inquisitive Indian was replaced by selfie collecting tourists. But Ram Advani's space continues to attract travelers, historians and writers from across the world. Lovers of books and arguments, including Rosie Llewellyn Jones, Lucknow's modern day chronicler, indologist William Dalrymple, and authors Amitav Ghosh and Ruskin Bond.\u000aAuthor and cultural historian, Salim Kidwai says that almost anyone who has written on Lucknow thanks Mr Advani in their published works. A modest man, he doesn't discuss politics, but some very important political discussions brew at his bookshop. And at the centre is the 90 plus, Ram Advani, a connoisseur of good books, good conversation, malt and music.\u000a

VJeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, expects the dollar to rise further against other currencies in the remaining period of 2015 on hopes of higher interest rates.

VAn "early version" of the screenplay for the new James Bond film was the latest victim of a massive hacking attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, its producers said in a statement on their website Sunday.\u000a\u000aThe news came less than two weeks after details of the new Bond movie "Spectre", starring Daniel Craig and Christoph Waltz, were unveiled.\u000a\u000aEon Productions confirmed "that an early version of the screenplay for the new Bond film SPECTRE is amongst the material stolen and illegally made public by hackers who infiltrated the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system."\u000a\u000aIt expressed concern that whoever carried out the hack could try and publish the "stolen" screenplay and vowed to take "all necessary steps" to protect their legal rights.\u000a\u000aHollywood giant Sony Pictures Entertainment has been hit by a string of embarrassing leaks following a huge hack, which some have blamed on North Korea after its anger at the forthcoming movie "The Interview", which lampoons its leader, Kim Jong-Un.\u000a\u000aThe leaks revealed a producer, Scott Rudin, describing Angelina Jolie as a "minimally talented spoiled brat" plus racially insensitive exchanges about US President Barack Obama between Rudin and co-chairwoman Amy Pascal.\u000a\u000a"Spectre" is due to hit screens worldwide on November 6 next year and also features Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux.

It seems to me that by comparing notes on how many countries he has visited or how many books he has read, he is trying to make people believe that he is ready for politics. \u000a He is as new to politics as Rahul Gandhi is. In my understanding, our country should not be lead by him or Rahul gandhi. All the better leaders (Lal Bahadur Shastri, Balgangadhar Tilak, Atal Behari Vajpayee) in our country were better because of the humble nature and hardwork. This guy is as arrogant as any other dick head in India.\u000a I just hope people in my country see this problem and just dont go after showbiz. Leasing a country is not a contest between how vocal a person is or how many poems he can recite.\u000a If knowing books, remembering poems or teaching in college would have been the qualification, then all the prof. in universities in India should be leading the country not a loud mouth like Dr Vishwas. \u000aAnonymous | 2 years agoReply | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike (1) AAP effect:\u000a Every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to be a leader :D \u000amadhavan | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike (2) Kumar Viswas seems to me from this interview, that he is not a man of character to take on Rahul Gandhi. He shows arrogance and negligence of Human respect to others. He accused other something and does the same tacktics to win votes (Eg. Visiting Dalits home for media attention).\u000a His accusation that Rahul has done nothing to deserve to be the p.m. candidate, except being the son of Sonia Gandhi is a laughing stock. Indirectly he is accepting Sonia as capable and good leader. Any way Rahul was not till now (43 Years)not simply reciting ´Kavitas`; he was involved in all the matters concerning congress party and of the nation. He has sacrificed a lot for our country. Simply to ignore this facts and trying to mullify Rahul is very bad character of Kumar Viswas. \u000aRahul Krishna Agarwal | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u091b\u093e \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u000aAyush Jha | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  Also, I do not endorse AAP's views on attacking and running away. This way of hurling allegations can be opted by anyone. Once you remain in power for long, controversies seem to find a good appetite for big you (public figures). AAP had proofs of corruption against congress before elections but that has changed quiet a bit now when they ask BJP to present them with the proof. Much more can be said, but i suggest AAP fastly learns it's lessons. \u000aAyush Jha | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  I personally am a Modi supporter but i love Kumar Vishwas's views. I find them very similar to what every normal Indian wants, atleast similar to my thinking and ideologies. Also Wishwas has very nice poetic vocabulary/skills which in turn enhances his oratory skills, keeps audience bound to chair. Sadly, in terms of LS elections i find myself as your opposition. Also not to mention that AAP was formed with purest of the motives but lacks on major national, international issues, Also, The people in control of power and decision making in AAP are not anything according to my ideologues. If that was not enough, AAP lacks in governance skills and is yet to prove it's mettle. A responsibility and chance was given to AAP in Delhi to perform and silence it's critics but it rather chose for publicity stunts, wasted it's energy for hastening into LS elections. Also, I feel retraction on every other statement reduced your accountability and credibility in people's eyes. So, every actions/statement should be cautiously well thought before being performed/spoken publicly and a statement once made should never be mended to fit the view others have but what your ideology says. \u000aSahbzada Sabubhai | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  No recognised wrestler (Pehelwan) ever challenged any one in is life, he had to fight to retain his 'title' only!It is the "tyro"-the "inexperienced that slaps (his thigh)and audaciously challenges one and all to have a fight with him and which ultimately proves his blunder only!\u000a Look at the AAP within a matter of 37 days its sheen has come off!How many somersaults its leader has made!Now Modi shines better than him!What a big fanfare was made of"Janata Darbar"!What a"fiasco' it has proved!Asif it was a rotten egg,he has thrown it beyond the boundaries of the national capital territory"!\u000a Kumar could not answer to the question how could he assert that those who protested against him were congressmen?He wriggled out saying one teen aged was having a "congress flag"\u000a When he was cornered by Barkha on "offending religious sentiments of one community",he said that he has apologised for it long ago!And that "he never meant to hurt anyone's feelings"!William Wordsworth has said,"Poetry \u000a is the spontaneous over-flow of'emotions'.It takes its origin from'emotions recollected in tranquility'!So a poet cannot detach himself from his inner emotions!He might have arranged his verses in tune with the rhyme and rythm of the topic given at that time. \u000aMore Comments\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VPune:  The parents, friends and relatives of a 14-year-old girl in Pune are angry. A 9th standard student of a school in Pune, she was the first casualty of swine flu in the country. Her parents allege that Jahangir Hospital where she was admitted initially as a case of pneumonia had kept them in the dark.\u000aThe girl showed symptoms of the flu on July 21 but got better soon after and started attending school. Then again, five days later, the fever was back and far worse. She had to be admitted to the ICU.\u000a"I have lost my child; it shouldn't happen to anyone else. The government should take strict action against this," said Sajid Osman Shaikh, her father.\u000aBut this girl's death has exposed the lack of coordination between government agencies. Pune's health authorities who were so far monitoring the swine cases in Pune's schools were totally in the dark about one case being treated at one of Pune's prime hospital, until the news of her death was confirmed and that too from Delhi.\u000a"I was informed about the case only after the incident, even my health officials were not informed," said Mahesh Zagade, municipal commissioner, Pune.\u000aJahangir hospital, whose primary responsibility was to refer the matter to the specially created swine flu hospital in Pune did not bother to inform the Pune health authorities who were found napping when the news of the girl's death broke.\u000a"We had informed the state health authorities and we were in touch with them," put forth Dr Prasad Mulgikar, from Jahangir Hospital, Pune.\u000aShockingly the Jahangir Hospital had asked another top private hospital to conduct a test of swine flu on the girl which turned out to be negative. Perhaps not knowing that swine flu tests are conducted only at the Pune's National Institute of Virology and NICD at Delhi - a lapse which cost the girl her life.\u000aMeanwhile her shocked school has declared a holiday on Tuesday to condole the death of their student. Her parents are contemplating legal action against the hospital for what they say was a series of grave lapses.\u000a

VArjun Rampal will be seen next in Satyagraha\u000aBollywood actor Arjun Rampal, who will be seen in Prakash Jha's Satyagraha, says that since he has worked with the director and the star cast before, the project was like "going back home" for him.\u000aThe film also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor and Manoj Bajpayee.\u000aArjun has worked with Jha in films like Raajneeti and Chakravyuh in the past. \u000a "It was fantastic. This is Prakash's most ambitious project. There is a wonderful star cast, all of whom I have worked with a lot. It was like going back home and having a good time," Arjun said.\u000aThe actor said that he had to spend a lot of time with the other actors during the shooting of the film, and that made it a memorable experience.\u000a"The film is quite intense... We spent a lot of time on and off set together. We were in Bhopal for 60 days," he said.\u000aJha had approached Arjun for the film while filming their last film Chakravyuh itself.\u000a"Prakash had not really got a character for me. He was working on Chakravyuh and he was scripting Satyagraha. He told me if he gave me a part, would I do it? I said yes. It became a full-fledged role and when I read the part, I really liked it," said the model-turned-actor.\u000aHowever, Arjun did not wish to play a similar role to what he had played in Jha's film, Raajneeti.\u000a"My fear was since I was going back with Prakash in a political thriller, will my character be similar to what I had played before. I wanted to stay clear from that. Prakash wanted to do something new and I was wondering how he will do that this time," he said.\u000aArjun will be seen as a young and volatile person in the film, but in a different way.\u000a"The character is different from what I played in Raajneeti, he is young and volatile but in a different way. He is not a selfish man or come from a rich home. He is a guy who is from the grassroots. He is the muscle power of that campaign," he said.\u000aSatyagraha is set to release on August 30.\u000a

VSalman Khan also thanked his ex-girlfriends' boyfriends for taking care of them\u000aWho knew it would be Salman Khan, 47, who would be the one to leave the never-at-a-loss-for-words Karan Johar speechless? He did it by the simple expedient of telling the filmmaker-turned-TV host on the first episode of the new season of Koffee With Karan that he had never had a girlfriend, adding for good measure: "I'm going to save myself for the one I get married to."\u000aA frankly incredulous Karan asked him, "Are you saying you are a virgin?"\u000a"Yes," came Salman's emphatic answer, said with a completely straight face. "I've had friends, no benefits," he threw in. \u000a Karan wasn't going to let that pass. "Have you been holding hands all these years," he enquired.\u000aSalman explained himself: "Tap on the back, like friends, buddies."\u000aWe didn't know about you but clearly Karan wasn't buying this story. His very next question was how did Salman handle bumping into ex-girlfriends. Salman, who had held forth on his girlfriend-free life not two minutes before this question, promptly came out with: "Some I ignore totally. I try and run away from them." Please note the use of the word 'some' - we did.\u000aHowever, it's not bad manners that's behind Salman's "ignoring" of "some" girlfriends. He clarified: "Now you're somewhere else, you have your own life. I don't want in someone else's mind that thought to come into that, you know, ex-boyfriend. I don't want anything of her past coming into their lives. So I stay miles away." What a gent.\u000aNot all ex-girlfriends are to be ignored, of course. "Sangeeta (Bijlani) is a friend. She's part of the family, she's always been," Salman said.\u000aHe's also OK with the current boyfriends of ex-girlfriends. In fact, he "thanks" them - not for taking the girls out of his life, as Karan cruelly suggested, but for taking good care of them.\u000aSalman also left Karan reeling in the rapid fire round.\u000aKaran: If you woke up as Ranbir Kapoor?\u000aSalman: Salman lucky hai ya main?\u000a Karan: At gunpoint if you were forced to have a gay encounter who would you want it to be with?\u000a Salman: Aisi koi gun bani hi nahi hai. But just to make you feel good, you Karan. (Was this what KJo wanted to hear?)\u000a Karan: Aishwarya or Katrina - the most stunning actress?\u000a Salman: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. And Katrina Kaif.\u000a Salman's parting shot: "Karan Johar doesn't want to work with me. (That's not true, says KJo) That is true. Who have you signed next? (I haven't signed anybody, says KJo) Don't lie, you've signed Ranbir Kapoor."\u000aThis was Alpha Khan's debut appearance on Koffee With Karan.

VParamilitary forces were stationed at NIT Srinagar after students clashed with police. (File photo)\u000aJammu:  The BJP today cautioned that the way outstation students are being dealt with at NIT Srinagar could have an impact on students from Jammu and Kashmir studying elsewhere in the country.\u000a"The elements involved in the misaction are anti-national and anti-people who want to destroy the peaceful atmosphere in the state by indulging in such type of violence which tantamount to instigating similar reactions against students from the state studying outside the state and putting to risk and jeopardy their lives," said Sunil Sethi, chief spokesperson of BJP's state unit.\u000aNoting that Jammu and Kashmir is poised to get the AIIMS and the IIT, he said, "Bad treatment given to our fellow countrymen in the state will dissuade the students and teachers to come to these institutions which looks like concerted effort to isolate the state from national mainstream."\u000aHe called upon the state government administration to take effective and strong action against all persons involved, including police officials, to instill confidence among outstation students.\u000aHe further said raising of national flag and chanting national slogans are a matter of pride and the state has to facilitate activities which propagate nationalism.\u000aAction should be taken against all such elements who are indulging in anti-national slogans and hoisting flags of Pakistan which amounts to supporting and propagating terrorism and separatism in the state and rest of country, Mr Sethi said.\u000aHe said there should be total ban on sale and possession of Pakistani Flags in the state with penal consequences to stop the politics of hatred in the state.\u000a

VBhubaneswar:  A retired Army officer has moved the Supreme Court to stop the Odisha government from releasing jailed Maoists in exchange of abducted Biju Janata Dal (BJD) Jhina Hikaka. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the plea tomorrow.\u000aRetired Major General Gangdeep Bakshi filed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court seeking to prevent the release of the Maoists from prison. He wanted the matter to be heard today because the deadline for the Odisha government to release the Maoists in exchange of Mr Hikaka ends today at 5 pm.\u000aHowever, the Supreme Court told Major General Bakshi, "you are coming at the eleventh hour and you can't hold us as hostage." It said it will take up the case tomorrow.\u000a

VSales of LG's flagship smartphone, the G2, have been below expectations, according to a new report emerging from Korea.\u000a\u000aWhen LG launched the G2 in August this year, the smartphone created a lot of buzz thanks to its unique design, as it features the power button and the volume rocker on the back of the phone, instead of the sides of the phone, as is usually the case.\u000a\u000aHowever, a Korean publication Asia Today has revealed in a report that LG has been unable to cash-in much on its uniquely designed LG G2 smartphone. As per the report, LG sold around 600,000 units of G2 in South Korea since the launch; internationally the South Korean major sold about 2.3 million units, while the company had set a sales target of 3 million for the G2 globally.\u000a\u000aThe report also notes that LG had spent a lot in terms of marketing and advertising for the LG G2 but the results have been disappointing.\u000a\u000aLG launched the LG G2 globally back in August. The LG G2 features a 5.2-inch full-HD (1080x1920) display, with a pixel density of 423ppi. It is powered by Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor that's clocked at 2.26GHz. The device comes with 2GB of RAM and offers 16GB and 32GB storage options.\u000a\u000aThe LG G2 sports a 13.0-megapixel rear camera with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 2.1-megapixel front shooter. LG's latest flagship runs Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and is powered by a 3,000mAh battery. The LG G2 sports dimension of 138.5x70.9x8.9mm, weighs 143 grams.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, LG's chief competitor and another South Korean major, Samsung claimed on Tuesday that its Galaxy Note 3 touched the 10 million mark in just two months.\u000a\u000aA recent report suggested that LG might be working on a mini variant of the LG G2, believed to be dubbed LG G2 mini. The report further speculates that LG might launch the alleged LG G2 mini at CES 2014 in January at Las Vegas.

VRiyadh:  Illegal foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, mostly Asians, are in a race against time to take advantage of an amnesty ending Wednesday that would allow them to stay or return home without prosecution.\u000aKing Abdullah announced the amnesty on April 3, granting foreign workers three months to regularise their residency or leave the oil-rich Gulf monarchy to avoid being blacklisted or jailed and fined.\u000aMore than 1.5 million illegal foreign workers came forward during the first two months of the amnesty, the labour ministry said.\u000aIt did not say how many illegal foreign workers currently live in the kingdom, but the number is reported to be around two million.\u000aOf these, some 180,000 have left in addition to more than 200,000 unregistered workers expelled at the start of the year under new regulations to stamp out illegal immigration.\u000aMany workers are still queueing outside their embassies to obtain documents to either leave Saudi Arabia or legalise their status before Wednesday.\u000aAs in most Gulf states, foreigners in Saudi Arabia need to be sponsored by a local business to obtain entry and work permits.\u000aForeigners desperate to work in the country are willing to pay for sponsorship, and sponsoring expatriates has become a lucrative business for some Saudis.\u000aBut under the new rules workers can be employed only by their own sponsors.\u000aSharon, a Filipina maid, stood queing in the scorching heat outside her country's embassy in Riyadh.\u000a"I'm trying to renew my passport as I am desperate to find an employer to sponsor me and keep me in the kingdom," she said.\u000a"I've provided fingerprints and obtained a travel document, in case I don't get my passport ready in time," the 38-year-old said.\u000aBut 25-year-old Anne, also from the Philippines, was concerned.\u000a"I have a travel document in hand, but I cannot find a seat on a flight to Manila. I am anxious to be with my daughter who I haven't seen in four years and hold her in my arms," she told AFP.\u000aIn Jeddah, the commercial capital, Indonesian worker Ali Rahman stood outside Jakarta's consulate, desperately waiting to finalise his documents.\u000a"I've lost hope unless the amnesty is extended to after July 3," he said.\u000a"There are still hundreds of us waiting here for consular formalities. And once completed, the paperwork has to go to the immigration authorities and the labour ministry."\u000aIt is a worrying time for the workers, most of whom are from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, but with some from Yemen and Egypt too.\u000aThey are fearful of the campaign of arrests promised by authorities once the amnesty expires.\u000aSaudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is a goldmine for millions of people from poor Asian and Arab countries where unemployment is high.\u000aAccording to official statistics, eight million expatriates work in the kingdom.\u000aThe new labour ministry regulations aim to reduce the number of foreign workers to create jobs for millions of unemployed Saudis.\u000aAlthough the country has the largest Arab economy, its unemployment rate is above 12.5 percent.\u000aSaudi Arabia has warned employers who continue to shelter illegal workers that they risk up to two years in prison.\u000aEconomic analyst Fadhl al-Bouainain said the move will benefit both Saudis and foreign workers.\u000a"This will help reorganise the labour market to promote the work of Saudis and protect foreign workers from the abuse of sponsors," he said.\u000aHowever, he warned that the massive departure of tens of thousands of workers will "negatively impact business", pointing out that some sectors, including construction, "are not attractive for Saudis" who want better paid positions.\u000aHe said the labour ministry should reduce by "at least 30 percent the number of workers in the kingdom, if the campaign is to be successful".\u000aAnother expert, Abdulwahab Abu Dahesh, was more sceptical of the amnesty's touted benefits.\u000a"As foreigners do more low-paid jobs, replacing them with Saudis will not be quick and the impact on the national economy will take some time."\u000a

(Reuters)\u000aWashington:  The United States believes Turkey should become more active in the air war against ISIS, secure its border and go after the militant group's facilitators who "intrude" into Turkey, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Tuesday."We need it to do more within its own territory, so it controls its border, which it has not done effectively since ISIS first arose," Carter told a hearing in Congress, using an acronym for the ISIS.\u000a"We would like them to operate more both in the air and on the ground. Most of the air operations are not directed at ISIS. They are directed at the PKK," he added, referring to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant group.\u000a

VThe Indian rupee recovered sharply on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of India took steps to rein in liquidity in a move that will raise interest rates in the economy.\u000aGovernment bonds slumped and interest rate swaps surged. The rupee rose to 59.13 per dollar compared with previous close of 59.89/90. (Read: What the RBI has done to defend the rupee)\u000aGlobal investment bank Credit Suisse said the fair value of rupee is at 55 to the U.S. dollar, but added that the central bank should have taken these tough measures earlier.\u000aCredit Suisse is negative on PSU banking stocks and also advised investors to sell Yes Bank & Kotak Mahindra among private lenders.\u000aMacquarie said the direct impact of RBI's move on banks will be fairly limited though these steps have pointed out towards a crisis. The brokerage ruled out rate cuts in the near term.\u000aAmong banking stocks, Yes Bank will be worst impacted, it added.\u000aMorgan Stanley said higher rates will be negative for banks and asset quality can continue to surprise negatively.\u000aIt advised investors to avoid companies with weak balance sheet, especially State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank.\u000aDomestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said the current measures will be ineffective as far as rupee is concerned.\u000a

VFishermen from Mumbai's Cuffe Parade area netted something unusual in their nets - a baby whale shark. The fish is endangered in places like Australia but does not have protected status in India. The fishermen said they wanted to release the 8-foot whale shark it but couldn't, as the fish would have carried their nets away but sadly the whale shark died as it was put ashore.\u000aComments\u000aSign in using or\u000aLoading...\u000aTo subscribe to email notification for comments, please add your email address.\u000aEmail\u000aName Email\u000aPost to FacebookPost to Twitter\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VUS computer giant Microsoft declared war on Internet king Google Thursday when it joined an anti-trust complaint in Europe that could result in billions of dollars in fines.\u000a\u000aIt is the first time Microsoft, which has itself been hit with multi-million-dollar anti-trust fines by Brussels, has gone public with submissions to European Union inspectors probing the online search giant.\u000a\u000a"Microsoft is filing a formal complaint with the European Commission as part of the Commission's ongoing investigation into whether Google has violated European competition law," read an online posting from Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel, Microsoft Corporation.\u000a\u000aThe move adds momentum to the probe against Google launched by EU regulators in November on accusations it has rigged the search market for consumers.\u000a\u000aEU competition watchdogs are investigating whether Google is guilty of "unfavorable treatment" of rival search services providers and whether the company's own services -- including YouTube video, book-scanning or telephony -- are getting "preferential placement" in consumer searches.\u000a\u000aThe Commission has "taken note" of the complaint and will ask Google for a response, said Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.\u000a\u000aAsked to comment, Google said the action was hardly surprising given a Microsoft subsidiary was one of the original complainants in the probe.\u000a\u000a"For our part, we continue to discuss the case with the European Commission and we're happy to explain to anyone how our business works," Google spokesman Al Verney said.\u000a\u000aThe November inquiry launched by the Commission, the European Union's anti-trust regulator, into Google's pre-eminent position in search services and online advertising followed several complaints, including one from internet portal Ciao, purchased by Microsoft in 2008.\u000a\u000a"We should be among the first to compliment Google for its genuine innovations," said Microsoft's Smith. "But we're concerned by a broadening pattern of conduct aimed at stopping anyone else from creating a competitive alternative."\u000a\u000aGoogle refused to divulge its share of the search services market but the Commission reckons it has clinched 95 percent in Europe.\u000a\u000aIn the United States, Microsoft says it serves around 25 percent of search needs either directly through its Bing search engine or its partnership with Yahoo!\u000a\u000aCiting court action against Google practices in the United States, Smith said the situation "is worse in Europe."\u000a\u000aGoogle was increasingly "walling off access to content and data that competitors need to provide search results to consumers and attract advertisers," he charged.\u000a\u000a"Having spent more than a decade wearing the shoe on the other foot with the European Commission, the filing of a formal anti-trust complaint is not something we take lightly," he stressed.\u000a\u000aHe cited by way of example "technical measures" put in place on YouTube after its 2006 acquisition by Google to restrict competing search engines from proper access.\u000a\u000a"Without proper access to YouTube, Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in returning search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users away from competitors and to Google," he said.

VA woman tries to get food at a shelter in school Liliane Mars Dumarsais Estime in Les Cayes, Haiti\u000aPort-au-Prince, Haiti:  At least 473 people are now known to have died as Hurricane Matthew leveled swaths of southern Haiti last week, officials said Tuesday, as hard-hit communities struggled to rebuild homes and access food and clean water.\u000aHaiti is observing three days of mourning for the victims of the deadly storm, which also left 75 missing and 330 injured according to the provisional toll from the nation's civil protection agency.\u000aMore than 175,500 people remain in shelters across the country, many of them in schools -- which is keeping nearly 100,000 children from resuming classes.\u000aMatthew struck as the impoverished nation was struggling to stifle a cholera outbreak that authorities fear will now worsen, with the World Health Organization pledging Tuesday to send a million doses of cholera vaccine.\u000aTwo water purification stations also arrived in Port-au-Prince Tuesday as part of France's first shipment of humanitarian aid, which comprised some 69 tons of supplies including medicine and anti-cholera kits.\u000aEach station produces 250,000 liters (66,000 gallons) of drinking water per day.\u000aBut damage to roads and communications has hamstrung deliveries of supplies in some areas, according to an AFP journalist in the southern coastal village of Groteaux.\u000aMany residents of that community were still struggling to find food and clean water as they scrambled to repair their battered homes.\u000a'Eating Only Coconuts'\u000aMany Groteaux homes sported new tin roofs bought at inflated prices, but poorer families could not afford new metal sheets to shelter them from intense sunlight, tropical rains or bloodthirsty mosquitoes.\u000a"Only God knows what we will eat," Jean Nelson, 68, told AFP. "We are eating only coconuts that fell."\u000a"We don't have money for rice," he said, adding that the price of the staple has doubled in the past week.\u000aNelson said that even though roads are now accessible, with cell phone coverage also starting to improve, no Haitian officials or relief workers have visited the hard-hit town.\u000aThe UN envoy Sandra Honore urged the Security Council on Tuesday to keep UN peacekeeping forces in Haiti for another six months to help cope with storm damage, ahead of a vote on renewing the mission's mandate.\u000aThe world body's chief Ban Ki-moon said a massive international response was needed to help Haiti as the United Nations launched a $120 million flash appeal for the next three months.\u000aCholera Fears Rising\u000aThe WHO said Tuesday it would send a million cholera vaccine doses to Haiti after the nation -- the America's poorest -- began seeing cases surge after Matthew's pummeling.\u000aWHO cholera expert Dominique Legros told reporters in Geneva there had already been "a sharp increase" in cases in the south of the country, with 148 cases detected in the Grande Anse department and 53 more in the Sud department.\u000aGrande Anse in Haiti's southwest took a direct hit from the storm, suffering by far the highest toll with 244 dead, the civil protection agency said.\u000aMatthew came as Haitians were already struggling with the intestinal disease spread by contaminated food and water, with more than 500 new cases each week.\u000aUN peacekeepers have been blamed for introducing the disease to Haiti, where it has killed 10,000 people since October 2010 -- and the world body tacitly admitted its share of responsibility earlier this year.\u000aThe WHO also called for the strengthening of Haitian health facilities so they can handle the brunt of the humanitarian crisis, rather than relying on outside medical intervention.\u000a"The best people to help Haitians are Haitians themselves," Jean-Luc Poncelet, the country representative for the UN's World Health Organization, told reporters Tuesday. "Priority must be given to the institutions already working in the country."\u000a"They know the people and therefore they are the most effective."\u000a

VIn total, 198 night shelters and 40 tents have been set up to accommodate around 19,000 persons. (AFP file photo)\u000aNew Delhi:  In an effort to prevent death of any homeless person due to sleeping in open during Delhi's chilly winters, the government has arranged night shelters and tents to accommodate at least 19,000 people.\u000aChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said," a few days ago a meeting of all departments was held in this regard and it was emphasised that no person dies because of sleeping in the open in cold nights. We all need to endeavor so that no one dies while sleeping in the open during winter."\u000aIn total, 198 night shelters and 40 tents have been set up to accommodate around 19,000 persons. If more people come there will be not be any shortage of space," he further said while inaugurating two night shelters at Geeta Ghat near Kashmiri Gate.\u000aHe also launched an App developed by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) for rescuing homeless people during the cold nights and putting them at night shelters.\u000a"The App will enable people to click pictures of homeless people sleeping out in the night and send it so that they could be rescued and sheltered, he said while criticising social media enthusiasts for mocking the government over it.\u000a"This App is not meant for the homeless people to use as some mocked it on social media. It is for all of us who have phones and who have been taken care of by the God. You need to click the photo and send us as you see homeless people sleeping in the open so that rescue teams could bring them to night shelters," he said.\u000aSpeaking on the occasion CEO of DUSIB, VK Jain, said that 33,000 blankets, 14,000 durries, 11,500 jute mats, have been arranged for use at nights shelters during the winter. Also, there are over 27,500 blankets in stock.\u000a"The night shelters are well maintained and special attention has been paid for maintaining facilities like drinking water and toilets."\u000a"We will also be ensuring round the clock monitoring of maintenance of the night shelters and rescue work through 20 teams," he said.\u000aAmong the 200 odd night shelters in Delhi, 44 are in Chandni Chowk constituency. The App launched by DUSIB can be downloaded by dialling the number 8826400500.\u000a"We will also be ensuring round the clock monitoring of maintenance of the night shelters and rescue work through 20 teams," he said.\u000aDUSIB with the help of NGOs will operate 20 rescue vans which will be used for bringing homeless people sleeping in open during winter night, to shelter homes.\u000aEach rescue van will be occupied by a team of four including a coordinator, besides the van driver.\u000aThe App can be used by anyone with a smart phone to click pictures of homeless people forced to stay out in the night.\u000aThe rescue teams will reach them and bring them to shelters, said a DUSIB official.\u000aAs soon as any photo or information about homeless people is sent it is received by a server at a control room set up in Punarvas Bhawan near ITO.\u000aThe information will be provided to NGO coordinators who will initiate follow up action and the sender of information or photo will also be updated about its progress and finally receive the 'complaint attended' message, added the official.\u000a

VBangalore:\u000aCooling domestic and foreign demand dragged on Indian manufacturing growth in March, with the sector expanding at its slowest pace since November 2011, a business survey showed on Monday.\u000aThe HSBC manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which gauges business activity in Indian factories but not its utilities, fell to 52.0 in March, after a surge to 54.2 in February.\u000aThe PMI has held above 50, the level that divides growth and contraction, for four years, but the March headline reading was the biggest month-on-month drop since September 2011.\u000a"Manufacturing activity lost momentum in March, with output growth slowing notably on the back of a deceleration in new orders," said Leif Eskesen, economist at HSBC.\u000aElectricity outages across India over the last month also crimped factory production, Eskesen said.\u000aThe new orders index fell from 56.3 in February to 52.8, the weakest pace of growth since November 2011. In turn, overall output grew at its weakest pace in more than a year.\u000aGrowth in new export orders also cooled to its lowest level since November 2011, reflecting the deepening global economic fallout from Europe's three-year sovereign debt crisis.\u000aThat is a disappointing signal for an economy with a wide current account deficit that hit a record high at 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product in the December quarter.\u000aHowever, most recent official data showed India's industrial output grew an annual 2.4 per cent in January as merchandise exports snapped a falling trend. Exports grew for the second straight month in February.\u000aThe HSBC Markit survey also showed input and output prices rose at a slower pace during the month, suggesting India's inflation rate will ease over coming months after picking up slightly to 6.84 per cent in February.\u000a"Encouragingly, input and output price inflation eased. Even so, the scope for further monetary policy easing remains limited," added Eskesen.\u000aThe Reserve Bank of India, facing intense pressure from industry and government to loosen monetary conditions to arrest the worst economic slowdown in a decade, has cut its key lending rate twice so far this year by 25 basis points each to 7.50 per cent after leaving it on hold for nine months.\u000aHowever, the central bank warned the prospect of further monetary easing is limited.\u000aA recent uptick in headline inflation and a record-high current account deficit limit the RBI's space for monetary easing despite pressure from a government facing elections in 2014.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a

VIt's make or break time for leftist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's attempt to avoid impeachment -- and for Brazil itself. (File Photo)\u000aRio de Janeiro, Brazil:  It's make or break time for leftist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's attempt to avoid impeachment -- and for Brazil itself.\u000aA months-long political crisis wrapped in a gargantuan corruption scandal and the worst recession for a generation starts coming to a boil this week.\u000aOn Monday, Rousseff's solicitor general, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, will make final arguments before a congressional impeachment commission, which then has five sessions to debate before voting.\u000aUnderling the urgency of the process, that vote is scheduled for April 11 and the commission chairman wants all 65 members seated before dawn so that they can finish in the same day.\u000aShortly after -- April 17 is the latest plan -- the commission's non-binding recommendation goes to the lower house, which will either scrap impeachment or send Rousseff to trial in the upper house.\u000aTwo thirds of the chamber, or 342 votes, are needed to move the case to the Senate, where legislators are considered likely to follow the lower house's lead.\u000aThis means Rousseff, who lost her main coalition partner to the opposition last week, might have just days to lobby for support and save her presidency.\u000aFollowing intense behind-the-scenes dealing, she is soon expected to announce a series of ministerial posts and other government jobs given in reward for congressional support.\u000aShe could also find out this week if the Supreme Court agrees to let heavy-hitting but controversial ex-president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, join her cabinet.\u000aLula is crucial to rallying the leftist base and negotiating an anti-impeachment coalition, but has been barred because he is accused in a case connected to a huge embezzlement and bribery scandal at state oil company Petrobras. The court decision should come by Thursday, Lula says.\u000a"This week will be the week where both sides are playing all their cards pretty hard and making their moves," Gabriel Petrus, a partner at the political consultancy Barral M Jorge Associates, told AFP.\u000a "The following week we'll have the final result of this battle."\u000a'Corruption In All Directions'\u000aRousseff is accused of illegally manipulating government accounts, a charge that many experts consider to be relatively light for impeachment.\u000aHowever, the one-time Marxist guerrilla during Brazil's military dictatorship is also taking fire for the brutal recession and the Petrobras corruption scandal. With only 10 percent government approval ratings and inability to pass legislation in Congress, Rousseff already looks powerless.\u000aBut those working to oust Rousseff themselves face serious allegations.\u000aRousseff's vice-president-turned- opponent, Michel Temer, has been linked -- though not charged -- as a participant in the Petrobras scandal. If Rousseff goes, he'd become president.\u000aThe speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who has spearheaded the effort against Rousseff, was charged by prosecutors last year with taking millions of dollars in bribes in the scandal and hiding the money in Switzerland.\u000a'Climate Of Hate'\u000aHuge opposition rallies and smaller but still significant pro-Rousseff rallies are now a regular feature across Latin America's biggest country, accentuating a divide that some fear could turn violent.\u000aAt a demonstration Saturday in the leftist northeast of Brazil, Lula said he had "never seen such a climate of hate."\u000aThe authorities said late Friday that they are looking into online death threats against Rousseff's spokesman, Edinho Silva, who earlier expressed worries that the increasingly nasty row could produce its "first corpse."\u000aWith Rousseff claiming she is victim of a coup and the opposition saying that the future of the country is at stake, compromise appears finished.\u000aReflecting that spirit, Cunha is planning to break the tradition of house speakers not participating in votes of this kind, Folha newspaper reported Sunday.\u000aIn addition, he plans to move the voting day to Sunday, April 17, making it easier for the opposition to rally outside Congress, the report said.\u000aHe also will insist on an open vote to make it harder for deputies trying to hedge their bets in a secret ballot or -- as Rousseff's camp is trying to persuade many to do -- abstaining or not showing up.\u000a"To me, not being present is the same thing as voting (no)," O Tempo newspaper quoted Cunha saying Saturday. "A political war will be waged and the punishment for those who don't show up will be political."\u000aYet another trick Cunha plans, Folha reported, is to swing momentum against Rousseff by starting the voting with deputies from the right-leaning south of Brazil, rather than alternate between north and south, as would be the norm.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VDonald Trump participates in a debate sponsored by Fox News at the Fox Theatre on March 3, 2016 in Detroit, Michigan. (AFP)\u000aThe changing tenor of the Republican presidential race might have been demonstrated best by a pair of questions about immigration -- one last year, one Thursday night. In October, at the CNBC debate that became defined by Sen. Ted Cruz's, R-Texas, mockery of the questions, Donald Trump was asked simply if he was "in favor of H1Bs," visas for high-skilled labor.\u000a"I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally," he said. "And you know what? They can have it any way you want. You can call it visas; you can call it work permits; you can call it anything you want ... as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have to -- it's fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders; we have a country of laws; we have to obey the laws. It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally."\u000aThere was no follow-up question. In fact, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, quickly said that Trump was right.\u000aThursday night, Fox News's Megyn Kelly invoked the CNBC answer to ask whether Trump had vacillated. "Your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, 'decimate American workers,'" she said. "However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas. So, which is it?"\u000aTrump bit right into the question. "I'm changing. I'm changing," he said. "We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can't do it, we'll get them in."\u000aKelly followed up: "So you're abandoning the position on your website?"\u000a"I'm changing it," said Trump, "and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country."\u000aImmediately, this was covered as a fresh position change from Trump. It was not, really. But under pressure, which did not exist in October, he adopted the frame -- that he was "changing." Cruz, who had no interest in attacking Trump until last winter, quickly turned the answer into an attack on "the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida."\u000a© 2016 The Washington Post\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VNew Delhi:  A Supreme Court judge today recused from hearing appeals pertaining to dropping of criminal conspiracy charge against LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and other BJP-VHP leaders in the Babri Masjid demolition case.\u000aJustice V Gopala Gowda, who was heading the bench also comprising Justice Arun Mishra, recused himself from the hearing without citing any reason and said, "let the matter be placed before the Chief Justice" for its allocation to some other bench.\u000aThe appeals were filed by one Haji Mahboob Ahmad and the CBI against the dropping of conspiracy charges against senior BJP leaders Mr Advani, Mr Joshi and 16 others, for demolition of the disputed medieval structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.\u000aThe pleas had sought setting aside of the Allahabad High Court's order of May 20, 2010, which had dropped section 120B (criminal conspiracy) under the IPC while upholding a special court's decision.\u000aIn September last year, the CBI had told the top court that its decision-making was not influenced by anyone and the dropping of criminal conspiracy charge against senior BJP leaders in the case was not at its instance.\u000a"The decision-making process of the CBI is completely independent. All decisions are taken based on correct facts in the light of the extant law. There is no question of any person, body or institution influencing the decision-making process of CBI or the manner in which it pursues its cases in courts," the agency had said in an affidavit.\u000aThe agency had said its decision-making process was carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of CBI Crime Manual and there was a "hierarchic" mechanism that allowed officers at each level to take decisions and make reasoned recommendations in an independent manner.\u000aEarlier, the top court had sought responses of Mr Advani, Mr Joshi, union minister Uma Bharti and 16 others on Ahmad's plea.\u000aBesides BJP leaders Mr Advani, Mr Joshi and Mr Bharti, the court had also sought response from Himachal Pradesh Governor Kalyan Singh, among others.\u000aShiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray and VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore were among the accused, who have since died.\u000a

VNew York:\u000aThe Golden Arches are starting to lose some of their shine.\u000aMcDonald's Corp. says a key revenue figure came in flat in July, its worst showing in more than nine years, as diners pulled back amid a rough economy. After years of outperforming rivals with a string of popular new items, the snag also suggests competition is intensifying for the world's biggest hamburger chain.\u000aThe last time the global sales figure dipped for McDonald's was in April of 2003. The figure had grown every month since then, even through the recession.\u000a"McDonald's may be underperforming the industry, which is not typical for them," said Sara Senatore, a Bernstein analyst. She noted that Taco Bell is showing strength as a result of its popular new Doritos-flavored tacos, with revenue at restaurants open at least a year registering double-digit growth in the second quarter.\u000aBurger King Worldwide Inc. and Wendy's Co. are also revamping their menus and stepping up their marketing campaigns.\u000aIn the U.S., McDonald's said its promotions failed to drive growth in July, and revenue at restaurants open at least 13 months dipped 0.1 percent. The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company also says it faced a tough comparison from a year ago, when it launched the mango pineapple smoothie.\u000a The figure dipped 0.6 percent in Europe because of weakness in Germany and several Southern European markets. It fell 1.5 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region \u2014 a key growth area for McDonald's.\u000aSales in Latin America and Canada, which are not reported separately, helped pull overall results even with last year.\u000aOverall, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected growth of 2.8 percent in July.\u000aRevenue in restaurants open at least 13 months is a key measure of a restaurant chain's performance because it strips out the impact of recently opened or closed stores. The figures are a snapshot of money spent on food at both company-owned and franchised restaurants. They do not reflect corporate revenue.\u000aIn economically hard-hit regions, McDonald's has been working to emphasize the value of its meals to entice penny-pinching consumers to eat out more often. In Europe, which accounts for 40 percent of the company's business, the company said last month that guest traffic was down in several regions during the second quarter.\u000aMcDonald's, which has more than 33,500 locations around the world, is often seen as a bellwether for the industry. Its stock price has nearly quadrupled over the past decade and surpassed the $100 mark late last year. But shares have since declined and closed down almost 2 percent at $87.53 Wednesday.\u000aThe company has exceeded expectations over the years by emphasizing value and evolving its menu to keep up with changing tastes. Some of its most successful new offerings \u2014 such as snack wraps and specialty coffees \u2014 have high profit margins, yet give customers a way to treat themselves for just a few bucks.\u000a"This chain has gone through a complete metamorphosis since the early part of the 2000s," said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones. Now McDonald's may struggle to continue delivering the same level of growth, he said.\u000a"Instead of leading the pack as they have for so long, they're running with the pack," he said.\u000aStill, Russo noted that disappointing results for one month don't necessarily spell doom for McDonald's. He noted that there was also one less Friday and Saturday in July, which likely affected sales, and the timing of Ramadan this year could have hurt sales in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. And McDonald's sheer size still gives it a considerable marketing edge over competitors going forward.\u000aGrowth might not be as fast in the future but still should be "respectable," Russo said. "There's something to be said for consistency."\u000aCEO Don Thompson, who took the helm in July, said in a statement Wednesday that he's confident the company will build sales over the long term.\u000aMcDonald's said it plans to restart growth in the U.S. by continuing to offer variety and new menu items. In Europe, it said it will boost customer traffic by featuring everyday value items. In Asia, the company has been working to offer locally relevant menu options and "convenience enhancements," such as delivery.\u000aBut there are no signs competitors will pull back on their efforts or that the economic climate will improve. Last month, McDonald's said its net income fell 4 percent in the second quarter as unfavorable currency exchange rates and high costs ate into profits.\u000aRevenue at restaurants open at least a year rose 3.7 percent in that quarter, which was the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2009.\u000a

VOpposition demonstrators seek shelter during a protest against the government of President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on May 14, 2014. AFP\u000aCaracas:  Venezuelan police arrested 105 people and fired tear gas at anti-government student protesters who hurled stones and fireworks Wednesday at a ministry building in the capital, officials said.\u000aThe students, who were marching to demand the release of protesters arrested in recent days, massed in eastern Caracas. But the demonstration quickly became violent when they targeted the Tourism Ministry and riot police intervened.\u000aIt was the latest chapter in months of turbulence in the oil-rich but economically and socially troubled South American country.\u000aAt least 42 people have died and more than 800 have been injured since students and other opponents of the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro took to the streets in February to protest rampant crime, runaway inflation and shortages of basic goods.\u000aManuel Quevedo, commander of the National Guard regiment in Caracas, said 16 women and 89 men were arrested Wednesday, including 11 minors. He had earlier indicated that about 80 arrests had been made.\u000aLocal non-governmental group Foro Penal confirmed the tally.\u000aWhile declining to confirm how many civilians were wounded in the clashes, Quevedo said two members of the security forces were wounded.\u000aOne captain of the National Guard was assaulted, while another sergeant almost got rolled over by vehicles due to protesters trying to prevent the transfer of detainees to prison, according to the military chief.\u000a"Everything has been done with respect for human rights," he added.\u000aTrucks carrying the detainees tried to move along the main route of the Caracas district of Chacao, heart of more than three months of opposition protests, amid a crowd shouting "Let them go!"\u000aLast week, more than 200 people were arrested in police raids on encampments of protesters in Caracas. Most have since been freed.\u000a"Fewer and fewer people are heeding protest calls. Intimidation has succeeded," one of the young marchers told AFP, requesting anonymity after a previous arrest.\u000a

VLadakh:  China and India have simultaneously withdrawn their troops from the face-off point at Daulat Beg Oldie near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Sources said the agreement was reached after intense negotiations via diplomatic channels and the modalities were worked out at a flag meeting between Indian and Chinese commanders today.\u000aThe National Security Advisor briefed the Prime Minister about the withdrawal, which sources said, was completed at 7:30 pm on Sunday .\u000a"Am glad behind the scenes tough negotiations worked with China rather than public bluster," RPN Singh, Minister of State in the Home Ministry, tweeted this morning.\u000aThis ends the deadlock that began when Chinese troops set up camp 19 km inside Indian territory in the Depsang Valley near the LAC, the de facto border. Soon after, India set up its own post just 500 metres away.\u000aBoth sides have now withdrawn their troops to positions held prior to April 15, the "status quo" that India had pushed for and China had not agreed to in three previous flag meetings.\u000aEarlier last week, sources had told NDTV that India, unhappy with the way the negotiations were progressing, was considering cancelling External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid's upcoming trip to China. Mr Khurshid himself had said that he couldn't "predict with certainty" whether he would be travelling to Beijing for his scheduled visit beginning May 9.\u000aMeanwhile, the Chinese Premier, Le Keqiang, is scheduled to visit New Delhi on May 20.\u000a

VThe Dragon space capsule, which has launched a new era of commercial spaceflight, completed its first tests before its scheduled docking at the International Space Station, NASA said Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe test flight of US company SpaceX's capsule, which launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on Tuesday, aims to show that industry can restore US access to the ISS after NASA retired its space shuttle fleet last year.\u000a\u000a"So far everything is going as planned," said NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, that directs all ISS missions and activities. He pointed to a "sense of optimism" among the mission control team.\u000a\u000aHumphries said the capsule has completed the first part of its demonstration flight, including navigating with the Absolute GPS system, an abort demonstration and a demonstration of free drift, a mode often used when interacting with the ISS.\u000a\u000aThe mission is set to include a fly-by and berthing with the station this week, before the capsule returns to Earth at the end of this month.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the spacecraft's sensors and flight systems are to undergo a series of tests to see if it is ready to berth, including a complicated fly-under at a distance of about 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers).\u000a\u000aIf NASA gives the green light, the Dragon will then approach the ISS on Friday in an attempt to berth with the station.\u000a\u000aIf the Dragon capsule successfully docks at the orbiting outpost, it will mark a new era in space transportation with commercial firms playing a growing role in space travel.\u000a\u000aThe astronauts on board the ISS will maneuver the station's robotic arm to help capture the capsule and attach it to the orbiting research outpost.\u000a\u000aThe hatch of the Dragon is set to open on Saturday to unload 521 kilograms (1,148 pounds) of cargo for the space lab and restock it with a 660-kilogram (1,455-pound) load to return to Earth.\u000a\u000aOn May 31, the Dragon is set to detach from the station and seek to make a safe landing in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California.

VSrinagar:  A former Hizbul Mujahideen militant, who had suffered critical injuries when a grenade was lobbed inside a police vehicle which was transporting him to Baramulla this afternoon, has succumbed to his injuries.\u000aShakeel Ahmad Kasana was the former bodyguard of Hizbul chief Syed Salahudin. He was arrested last year under Section 7/25 of the Arms Act.\u000aKasana was being shifted by the police to the Baramulla district jail in north Kashmir from the Panthachowk police station in Srinagar, when militants attacked with a grenade near Batmaloo. The four policemen inside the vehicle also sustained injuries and have been admitted to a hospital. They are said to be out of danger.\u000aMilitant attacks are on the rise in the Kashmir valley. On June 24, eight army jawans were gunned down by two terrorists on the outskirts of Srinagar, a day before the Prime Minister visited the Valley.\u000aThe Army yesterday said that Pakistan-based militant groups have intensified their infiltration attempts along the border and around 300 militants continue to be active on the other side of the Line of Control (LoC), just along the Jammu region.\u000a

VLinkedIn, the professional-networking website firm, said Tuesday it expects to be worth as much as $4 billion when it goes public soon, sparking fears of another Internet bubble.\u000a\u000aLinkedIn raised the share price for its public listing by some 30 percent, lifting the company's value as high as $4 billion and testing the market's lust for Internet companies.\u000a\u000aFor what will be the first initial public offering by a major US social-networking firm, LinkedIn jacked up its expected share price for 7.84 million shares to between $42 and $45, just a week after it first set a target of $32-35 per share.\u000a\u000aThe IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, as early as Thursday, could bring in more than $350 million.\u000a\u000aLinkedIn, whose members cultivate and manage their careers and business networks online, said it plans to use the money raised on the stock market to fuel expansion.\u000a\u000aBut the dizzying spike in the IPO price range has set off alarms.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Wall Street Journal, it is the first time since the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 that a firm has hiked its price range by so much ahead of its share float.\u000a\u000aThe LinkedIn market debut will be the biggest in the United States since Internet search giant Google went public in August 2004, IPO specialist firm Renaissance Capital said.\u000a\u000aIn a survey of investors and traders about the share pricing, financial website 24/7WallSt.com found that two thirds thought "it's already too high."\u000a\u000aAlthough LinkedIn more than doubled revenue in 2010, to $243 million, it says it expects a loss in 2011 and slowing growth.\u000a\u000aThe Mountain View, California-based firm swung into profit of $3.4 million in 2010 after a $4.0 million loss the prior year.\u000a\u000aA recent Internet market flotation has provided food for second thoughts. Investors who two weeks ago snatched up shares in social-networking site firm Renren, seen as China's answer to Facebook, have watched their shares drop by nine percent from the IPO price -- which was also hiked by 27 percent days before the subscription period.\u000a\u000aBut Lou Kerner, an analyst specialized in social networking firms at Wedbush Securities, was not surprised by LinkedIn's attraction.\u000a\u000a"There's very significant investor demand for what's going to be the premier public equity in social media," he said, dismissing the speculation about a new Internet bubble.\u000a\u000aThe talk "misses the bigger point, which is that there is a tremendous amount of shareholder wealth being created in social media today, and there are very few ways for public investors to play it."\u000a\u000aFor many market players, LinkedIn's IPO is an opening act for the blockbuster float of social-networking giant Facebook, which could come in early 2012.\u000a\u000aWith currently more than 500 million users worldwide, Kerner estimated that Facebook's IPO could drive the firm's valuation to a whopping $85 billion and to $235 billion by 2015.\u000a\u000aUntil then, he said, investors could look at shares in companies potentially worth twice that of LinkedIn and expected to go public: online social game star Zynga and online coupon giant Groupon.\u000a\u000aMorningstar IPO analyst Bill Buhr agrees that market appetite for social-media stocks is understandable, but not necessarily justified.\u000a\u000a"If you consider Facebook, for instance they're talking about a $100 billion valuation, on $4 billion of expected revenue, which puts them at about 25 times sales multiple. Google has a five times sales multiple," he said.\u000a\u000aThe market enthusiasm for Groupon is even more astonishing, he said, with people talking about a valuation of around $15-20 billion.\u000a\u000a"For an online coupon company that the only thing they've really done correctly is be the first mover, maybe that's not justified."\u000a\u000aThe fast-growing LinkedIn has more than 100 million members in over 200 countries and territories. Forty-four million live in the United States and 56 million outside of the country.\u000a\u000aMembership grew by 428 percent in Brazil last year, 178 percent in Mexico, 76 percent in India and 72 percent in France.

VA National Disaster Response Force worker rescues a boy in Chennai. (Associated Press photo)\u000aWashington:  The severe flooding in Chennai caused by torrential rains is a result of climate change and should be an eye opener for city planners, experts here have warned.\u000aSome experts have opined that Chennai being one of the outsourcing hub of India and a major destination of foreign investment, the current disastrous situation could also affect the national economy.\u000a"Chennai has seen 17 days straight of rain, precisely the kind of extreme weather event that experts say will only become more common in a warming world," said Nambi Appardurai, India's adaptation strategy head for World Resources Institute (WRI).\u000a"Having been in the adaptation business for about 10 years now, I find these events reinforce the challenges we face in adapting to a changing climate. No doubt about it, there's so much to learn from this experience.\u000a"These sudden, erratic rainfalls are something we've seen happening over the years and the fact that this is an El Nino year has also contributed to extreme events. Certainly, though, climate has an impact as well," he said.\u000aThe experts have, however, also highlighted the positive use of social media - Twitter, Whatsapp and Facebook -- as a resource tool for the people to organise and help each other.\u000aAswin Punathambekar, associate professor of communication studies at the University of Michigan, said with over half a million tweets in less than two days, citizens in Chennai and across the country mobilised to produce an infrastructure of care.\u000a"The hashtags #chennairains and #chennairainshelp are a truly creative, citizen-driven response to a crisis and at the same time a resounding call for the government machinery in India to rethink urban planning, develop better systems to deal with natural disasters and to lead the way in tackling climate change" he said.\u000aPuneet Manchanda, a professor of marketing at the Ross School of Business, said the economic impact of the heavy rain in Chennai is going to be significant.\u000a"Obviously, industries such as tourism will face adverse outcomes as Chennai is the entry point for most tourists. The local infrastructure, especially roads, has also taken a big hit and this will continue to impact the local economy much after the rain subsides," he added.\u000aMatthew Boulton, whose research in India involves vaccination and other public health issues, felt that the risk of drowning and electrical hazards may be two of the most immediate dangers, but flooding and standing water of this magnitude can significantly increase the risk for serious waterborne illness, like childhood diarrhea.\u000a"Although many scientists are saying that these rains are a direct result of global warming, I think that climate change has exacerbated the intensity of such extreme weather events," said Mayank Vikas.\u000aMeanwhile, the Srivari Sri Balaji Temple, located in Franklin Township, New Jersey, has announced to organise a prayer on behalf of the Chennai flood victims today.\u000a"The prayer is being held to offer spiritual support to the thousands of individuals impacted by the floods in Chennai," the temple said in a media release.\u000aEmergency Toll Free Number: 1910, State Emergency: 1070, District Emergency: 1077, Electricity:1912, Fire & Rescue: 101, Ambulance: 108, Tree fall, waterlogging - 1913, Sewage overflow - 45674567, 22200335\u000a Helpline Numbers: Tiruvottiyur : 09445190001, Manali: 09445190002; Madhavaram: 9445190003, Ambattur: 9445190007; Tondiarpet: 9445190004, Royapuram: 9445190005; Annanagar: 9445190008, Teynampet: 9445190009, Alandur: 9445190012, Adyar: 9445190013,Perungudi: 9445190014\u000a Flood Control Room: 28593990, 044-28410577,9445869843/47\u000a

VChandigarh:  After spending four months in jail, former Punjab cabinet minister Bibi Jagir Kaur has been granted parole for 28 days. Ms Kaur is serving a five-year sentence at the Kapurthala Central Jail. She was convicted in March of various criminal charges related to her teen daughter's death in 2000.\u000aThe teenager, Harpreet, was forced into an abortion by Bibi Kaur. She died on April 20 under mysterious circumstances. No post-mortem was conducted. Bibi Kaur was at that time the president of the powerful Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Harpreet's family said she had died of severe dehydration, vomiting and fever.\u000aWhen Bibi Kaur was arrested, she was the only woman in the Punjab cabinet.\u000a"Kaur has been given parole for 28 days. She came out of jail today and left with her son-in-law for her village," Kapurthala Jail Superintendent S P Khanna said.\u000aA Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court in Patiala on March 30 this year convicted the then minister of forcible abortion, wrongful confinement, abduction and criminal conspiracy. She was, however, absolved of the charges of murdering her daughter.\u000aMs Kaur has been surrounded in controversy about receiving special treatment in jail ever since she was convicted. Video footage showed she was driven up to the jail in an air-conditioned Innova car. A policeman in the jail, in a gesture of respect, also bent down to touch her feet.\u000aMs Kaur was also a chief guest at a religious function held inside the jail where she was seen honouring Jagjit Singh, Inspector General, Prisons. At the function, Ms Kaur, who is also the head of the Dera Sant Baba Prem Singh, honoured some other jail officials as well, including the Jail Superintendent.\u000a

VBJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi addresses a rally in Guwahati. Earlier in the day Mr Modi spoke in Imphal also.\u000aHere are the highlights:\u000aCongress leaders not only have a small heart but also their thoughts and dreams are very small, their vision is also the same.\u000aWhere will they think of Gopinath ji when they could not even think of Sardar Patel.\u000aEveryone says that you are from BJP and a part of RSS and you are constructing the statue of unity.\u000aFor you he must be dhal ke neta, hamare liye he is a national leader.\u000aSardar Patel is a national figure, doesn't belong to any party.\u000aCongress has forgotten him, we have forced them to remember after 60 years.\u000aThe people of this country have decided to give Cong a farewell. Now the Congress party cannot escape.\u000aWho is responsible for this situation in Assam today, the killing of youth?\u000aWith peace, unity and brotherhood, we have to choose the path of development.\u000aYou have given the country its PM but what have they given you in return.\u000aYou have been sending a PM to Parliament for the last 22 years but what have got?\u000aThe people of Assam have the right to question the PM.\u000aIf PM can't do anything for you, what will he do for the country?\u000aIf PM can't do anything for his constituency then what will he do for the country?\u000aWhy has PM failed to develop N-E part of the country?\u000aThere is no employment here, what is the condition of the youth out here?\u000aPer capita revenue is the lowest in Assam.\u000aYou keep hearing 'humne MNREGA diya,' has anyone earned employment out of this?\u000aDon't say no to make me happy, tell the truth have you received employment?\u000aBut you'll still keep hearing 'humne MNREGA diya, MNREGA diya.'\u000aOut of 12 lakh people only 10,000 have earned jobs out of that programme which they keep talking about.\u000aCongress always cites NREGA when asked about anything.\u000aIf you want to bring change, you need to change your thoughts as well.\u000aHad AB Vajpayee become Prime Minister in 2004, the north-east would have been developed today.\u000aAccording to me, north-east is 'Asht-Lakshmi' and Lakshmi is always on a 'kamal' (lotus).\u000aLook at this government, water is flowing yet people remain thirsty for water.\u000aGujarat doesn't have rivers... drinking water used to be a problem. Eight years ago, tankers used to deliver water. But now, we have built water pipes so big that a family can sit inside a Maruti car and drive inside that pipe. The water problem is history in Gujarat now.\u000aCongress leaders consider India as their private property.\u000aI am shocked that during Rajiv Gandhi's tenure, there was an accord on Assam.\u000aAtal ji always said that we will make a new history with our neighbours.\u000aWho did Congress ask before deciding to give away your land?\u000aLocal youth in Assam are unemployed while immigrants have got jobs.\u000aYou have supported Congress for 60 years, did you all achieve anything?\u000aBut we (BJP) will ensure that we fulfill your expectations.\u000a

VThe Southeast Asia region was the next most affected, with 96 million cases. (Representational Image)\u000aGeneva:  The number of adults estimated to be living with diabetes has nearly quadrupled over 35 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today, urging huge efforts to change eating habits and increase physical activity.\u000a"Globally, an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980," the UN health agency said in its first-ever report on the disease, warning that the condition had spread because of worldwide changes "in the way people eat, move and live."\u000aThe disease directly caused 1.5 million deaths in 2012 -- the latest available global figures -- but elevated blood glucose levels linked to diabetes were responsible for an additional 2.2 million deaths that year, the report said.\u000aThe region worst affected, with 131 million estimated cases in 2014, was the WHO's Western Pacific region, which includes China and Japan.\u000aThe Southeast Asia region was the next most affected, with 96 million cases.\u000aEurope and the Americas were third and fourth on the list, with 64 million and 62 million cases respectively.\u000aLifestyle factors\u000aDiabetes is divided into two types.\u000aThere is no known way to prevent type one, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin.\u000aMost people living with diabetes have type 2, which is associated with obesity and other lifestyle factors and emerges in adults and increasingly among children.\u000aTo curb the intensifying burden of the disease, huge efforts were needed to change "eating and physical activity habits," especially early in life, when key behavioural patterns are formed, WHO said.\u000a"There is a critical window for intervention to mitigate the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life," the report said.\u000aIt noted that spreading consumption of sugary drinks and other fattening foods was a key factor, but drew particular attention to high rates of physical inactivity.\u000aAccording to worldwide 2010 figures, nearly a quarter of people over 18 did not do the minimum recommended amount of physical activity per week, with women recorded as less active than men.\u000aThe WHO recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, including things like walking, jogging and gardening, per week.\u000a"Physical inactivity is alarmingly common among adolescents," the report added, noting that the excessively sedentary lifestyles were more acute in high-income countries than low income countries.\u000aEconomic Toll, Response\u000aThe WHO estimated that the annual global cost of diabetes, including health care needs, exceeds $827 billion (728 billion euros).\u000aCiting a separate study, the agency said the global GDP losses linked to diabetes could reach $1.7 trillion by 2030, with the damage split roughly evenly between developed and developing nations.\u000aNoting both the health and macroeconomic damage caused by the growing diabetes epidemic, WHO chief Margaret Chan called for a coordinated, holistic response.\u000aLike with obesity, WHO has stressed that putting excessive blame on individuals for eating too much or not exercising enough ignored several key factors, including the obstacles to eating healthily in several societies.\u000a"Effectively addressing diabetes does not just happen: it is the result of collective consensus and public investment in interventions that are affordable, cost-effective and based on the best available science," Chan said in a statement.\u000a

Starting with a $250 price tag, the two new Chromebooks are said to begin shipping in North America by the end of June, as per Anandtech.\u000a\u000aBoth Asus Chromebooks share almost similar specifications with minor differences in the devices' display, dimensions and weight.\u000a\u000aWhile the Asus C200 sports an 11.6-inch LED-backlit glossy screen with a 1366x768 pixel resolution, the Asus C300 features a 13.3-inch LED backlit non-glossy display with the same resolution. The C200 Chromebook measures 12x7.9x0.8 inches and weighs around 1.1kg, and the C300 Chromebook measures 13x9.1x0.8 inches with a weight of 1.4kg.\u000a\u000aBoth the freshly introduced Asus Chromebooks share the same Intel Bay Trail-M dual processor N2830 clocked at 2.42GHz; Chrome OS; 720p HD front-facing webcam; 2GB of RAM; and 16GB of internal storage. The connectivity options include 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac dual-band Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.0; one USB2.0 port; one USB3.0 port; HDMI 1.4, and a SD card slot.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Lenovo also launched two new Chromebooks, N20 and N20p for $279 (roughly Rs. 16,700) and $349 (roughly Rs. 20,900) respectively.\u000a\u000aThe Lenovo N20 and N20p Chromebooks are the company's first consumer-facing Chromebooks, with its previous offerings meant for the education market. The two laptops carry the same internal specifications with some differences when it comes to the device's screen.

VIf you think the magical multi-touch technology powering your iPhone is cool, then you really need to take a look at what the researchers at the Hasso-Plattner Institute have been getting up to.\u000a\u000aHow does an Imaginary Smartphone sound? Technology developed at the Hasso-Plattner Institute in Germany literally turns your palm into a touch screen smartphone.\u000a\u000aThey have developed an ingenious camera tracking technology powered by a wearable depth camera that allows users to \u005cu00A0use their palm like a touch screen while inputs are transferred to the phone over Wi-Fi. Amazingly the entire process does not require any visual or physical feedback, only depending on your muscle memory and your personal ability to operate the phone blindly.\u000a\u000aPreviously, Massachusetts Institute of Technology had also unveiled a similar 'Sixth Sense' gestural interface technology - a gesture based interface for controlling mobile phones through a user's palm. In this technology, a camera was used for tracking gestures but we could also see a user interface popping up on the palm using a small projector.\u000a\u000aIs this the next step in the evolution of touch screen interfaces?\u000a\u000aWatch the videos below to see the technology used by Hasso-Plattner Institute and MIT.

VBroadcasters have sued a startup backed by media billionaire Barry Diller that sends live local TV feeds to iPhones and iPads in the New York area.\u000a\u000aTwo groups of broadcasters, including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the local PBS station, filed suits Thursday in federal court, saying Aereo Inc.'s service uses their content without permission.\u000a\u000aAereo launched two weeks ago, but it's available by invitation only. Subscribers pay $12 per month for access to 27 locally broadcast TV channels through the Web browsers on their Apple devices. It's set to open up to more subscribers on March 14. The company hopes to expand service to other cities.\u000a\u000aAereo says the suits are groundless and it looks forward to "a full and fair airing of the issues."\u000a\u000aAereo has more than $25 million in venture capital backing, with more than $20 million of it coming from a funding round led by InterActiveCorp, which owns Match.com, Ask.com and other websites. Diller is the chairman of InterActiveCorp and the former CEO of Fox.\u000a\u000aThe startup exploits what it believes is a loophole in the laws governing retransmission of local broadcasts. It doesn't use one big antenna to pick up the local broadcasts and relay them to the Internet. Instead, it uses one tiny antenna for each subscriber that's watching.\u000a\u000aPeople are entitled to watch local broadcast TV when they use their own antennas, and Aereo believes that what it's doing, legally speaking, is acting as a remote antenna for each subscriber, rather than taking broadcasts and retransmitting them.\u000a\u000a"Aereo's service to the end user is similar to and competes with cable or satellite operators and telephone companies that also retransmit broadcast programming to their subscribers, except that Aereo's service is unlawful," said the suit filed by ABC, CBS, NBC and others.

VThe Division might have had a rocky start, with servers keeling over for US audiences. However the game has seen few issues for users in other regions, including India. We're playing the game right now and after a few hours in here, we have some tips and tricks to help you survive post-pandemic Manhattan.\u000a\u000aKeep your distanceYour foes do a substantial amount of damage up close. You'd do well to keep from them, using every inch of cover to keep from getting shot. The Division's loot system appears to be rather generous allowing you to make use of its weapon modification system early on. This is crucial, and you want to get a weapon mod to attach a scope to your rifle right away. This really helps even the odds, even against enemies that are several levels higher than you.\u000a\u000aUse Pulse oftenDeep within the game's many menus lies a rather slick looking skill tree. It allows you to choose your starting set of abilities, ranging from medical, tech, and security skills. The medical skill-set is particularly important, especially the Pulse ability. This is because it lets you mark all enemies in the area, and will keep you from getting ambushed all the time. As an added bonus, this will also allow you to do critical damage to your enemies.\u000a\u000a(Also see:The Division Might Not Officially Support Mods, But There's Already One for It)\u000a\u000aReplay missions and level upLike every respectable RPG, The Division lets you gain experience points (XP) to help you unlock new skills and use better weapons. You gain XP for finishing missions, or picking up pieces of intel, or finding items. The fastest way to level up involves completing the game's Security Mission first, because it gives you the Experienced Agent perk, which increases XP gain from everything you do by a hefty 10 percent. You can also replay missions and adjust their difficulty before doing so to earn more XP, which will help you stay alive in more dangerous situations.\u000a\u000aAvoid storesTo borrow a phrase from Seinfeld's Kramer, "retail is for suckers". This holds true for The Division too. Don't waste money on armour and weapons; you're better off scavenging what you can off the corpses of your enemies. Mission rewards and item drops are generous enough that you don't need to bother with the game's many merchants. Not only are the items a whole lot better, but scavenging also allows you to use your funds later at the end-game, when you'll need it to purchase rare and exotic weaponry.\u000a\u000a(Also see:Here's What You Can Expect From The Division During the Year)\u000a\u000aDon't fear the Dark ZoneThe Dark Zone is a sealed off contaminated area in Manhattan. There, you can find fantastic gear that you can palm off to unsuspecting vendors. From our experience, even loot drops that are mediocre compared to your currently equipped gear will net you a ton of cash, making it worth checking out.\u000a\u000aWhat are your strategies to taking on The Division? Let us know via the comments.

VAbout 100,000 people have marched through Red Square to celebrate May Day; the first time the annual parade has been held outside the Kremlin since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 Photo Courtesy: Associated Press\u000aMoscow:  Russia staged a huge May Day parade on Moscow's Red Square for the first time since the Soviet era on Thursday, with workers holding banners proclaiming support for President Vladimir Putin after the seizure of territory from neighbouring Ukraine.\u000aThousands of trade unionists marched with Russian flags and flags of Putin's ruling United Russia party onto the giant square beneath the Kremlin walls, past the red granite mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin.\u000aMany banners displayed traditional slogans for the annual workers' holiday, like: "Peace, Labour, May". But others were more directly political, alluding to the crisis in neighbouring former Soviet republic Ukraine, where Russian troops seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula in March, precipitating the biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War. "I am proud of my country," read one. "Putin is right," said another.\u000aUnlike Kremlin leaders in Soviet times, Putin did not personally preside at the parade from atop the mausoleum. But he carried out another Soviet-era tradition by awarding "Hero of Labour" medals to five workers at a ceremony in the Kremlin. He revived the Stalin-era award a year ago.\u000aPutin has described the breakup of the Soviet Union as a tragedy and overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy in March by declaring Russia's right to intervene in former Soviet countries to protect Russian speakers.\u000aLaws have been changed to make it easier for Russia to annex territory from other former Soviet states and for inhabitants of other parts of the old Soviet Union to get Russian citizenship.\u000aSince the annexation of Crimea, pro-Moscow gunmen have seized territory in eastern Ukraine and Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. He denies he is planning an invasion but proclaims the right to launch one if necessary to defend Russian speakers.\u000aMay Day, always an important date in the Soviet calendar and still a major holiday for Russians, has been marked by rallies in other parts of Moscow since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, but until now parades were kept off Red Square.\u000aPATRIOTIC UPLIFT\u000aMoscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV from Red Square that more than 100,000 people had marched through it. "This is not by chance, because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country," he said.\u000aRussian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol, with Russian flags and banners reading "Crimea is Russia. Welcome home."\u000a"We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation," Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists.\u000aRussia seized the peninsula last month after a pro-Russian Ukrainian president was toppled in February. The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of directing the uprising in south-eastern parts of Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and companies.\u000aThe sanctions, while not hitting Russia's industry directly, have hurt the economy by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for Russian 2014 economic growth this to just 0.2 percent on Wednesday and said Russia was already "experiencing recession".\u000aBut at home, the intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin, his highest rating since 2010.\u000a"Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and it's only right that we've become whole again," said Tatyana Ivanova, a worker at Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues. But not all Muscovites were so impressed.\u000a"Today isn't a particularly special holiday, it's just a nice spring day, and people are happy to have an opportunity to celebrate," said historian Kirill Strakhov, 31, speaking on another square near Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.\u000a"The authorities are trying to drum up support by encouraging patriotic feelings. They ignore the fact that there are many difficult economic and geopolitical problems associated with the unification of Crimea."\u000aPutin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9, the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars.\u000aCentral Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week\u000a

VWashington:  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is likely to be investigated for alleged misuse of public funds, a media report said, quoting state prosecutors.\u000aAccording to the federal prosecutors in Brazil, the former President sent out 10 million letters to older Brazilians promoting low-interest loans in 2004; the letters were not in the public interest and benefited a bank which was linked to another corruption scandal, the 'BBC' reported online.\u000aLula has not yet commented on the allegations.\u000aOne of his cabinet members, former Social Security Minister Amir Lando, is also being investigated. The two allegedly sent out the letters to 10.6 million retirees in 2004 at a cost of around US dollars 3.5 million, the report said.\u000aThe letter informed pensioners of a new credit scheme which would allow them to take out loans at a reduced rate of interest. At the time, the only Brazilian bank offering those loans was the private financial institution BMG.\u000aAccording to prosecutors, the letters served no social, informative or educational aim.\u000a"In light of our investigations, we can easily conclude that the aim of the letters was one of self-promotion, praising the effects (of the low-interest loan scheme) and therefore advertising it, and at the same time benefiting the BMG bank," the prosecutors added.\u000aProsecutors have asked Lula and Lando to repay the authorities the money spent on the mailing and postage of the letters, the report said.\u000a

VTrenton, New Jersey:  The bodies of a woman and her 13-year-old son were found after a day long standoff, and her boyfriend was killed as officers stormed a New Jersey home to rescue three other children he had been holding captive, authorities said on Sunday.\u000aPolice officers went to the home on Friday afternoon after reports that some of the children hadn't been to school in 12 days, authorities said on Sunday at a news conference. Officers entered the home through a rear door and smelled an odor consistent with that of a decomposing body, Trenton Police Director Ralph Rivera Jr. said.\u000aThey found 38-year-old Gerald "Skip" Murphy in an upstairs bedroom, and he told them he was armed with a gun and explosives and had three children with him, Mercer County Prosecutor Joseph L. Bocchini Jr. said. Officers retreated from the second floor and rescued a 19-year-old man from the basement, who said he hadn't seen his mother or siblings since about April 24.\u000aA SWAT team was called in, and an arson bomb unit also appeared on the scene. Police said Murphy could be seen from a window holding a black handgun.\u000aPolice remained in contact with Murphy throughout the 37-hour-long standoff and passed food into the home through an upstairs window, state police Col. Rick Fuentes said. Murphy kept the captives with him inside the bedroom throughout the standoff, authorities said.\u000aOfficers stormed the home at around 3:45 a.m. Sunday after noting Murphy's "deteriorating state of mind" and deciding it was necessary to enter to help ensure the captives survived, Fuentes said. An officer shot Murphy because he was threatening one of the children, he said.\u000aMurphy was taken to a hospital and later died of his injuries. No law enforcement personnel were injured during the standoff or the confrontation with Murphy.\u000aAuthorities found the bodies of 44-year-old Carmelita Stevens and her teenage son in separate bedrooms. The woman's body was in an advanced state of decomposition, and police said she appeared to have died two weeks ago.\u000aThree of her children - an 18-year-old woman, a 16-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy - were rescued and taken to a medical center for evaluation and treatment. Murphy had abused and assaulted the captives, Bocchini said.\u000aMurphy and Stevens had been dating for a few months, and both lived in the house, police said. He was not the father of any of her children.\u000aAuthorities wouldn't comment on a possible motive or say how the victims died, citing the ongoing investigation. They also would not say whether any bombs or other explosives were recovered at the residence.\u000aMurphy had a long criminal history including convictions for aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy, Bocchini said. He had previously been arrested for robbery and weapons offenses and child endangerment. He also had an arrest warrant in Pennsylvania for failing to register as a sex offender.\u000a

VNew Delhi:  Union Minister Vayalar Ravi disapproved of the petrol price hike on Saturday, and suggested a "bold may be taken to reduce the recent increase". The state-run oil companies have announced a reduction of R 2 per litre in petrol prices on Saturday, which became effective from midnight, after increasing the price by R 7.50 per litre On May 23.\u000aMinister for Overseas Affairs Mr Ravi, in a letter to Petroleum Minister S Jaipal Reddy, questioned the claims of oil marketing companies that they are incurring huge losses and asked his cabinet colleague to scrutinise the issue in detail. (Read: Vaylar Ravi's letter to Petroleum Minister Jaipal Reddy)\u000a"Apparently, the claim made by oil companies that they are running at a loss seems to be untrue. As a matter of fact, the expenditure of oil companies, including salaries, is among the highest in India and there is a perception that funds are being wasted," Mr Ravi said in the letter.\u000a"In this backdrop, I feel a closer scrutiny is needed before deciding on any further increase in oil prices. Instead, a bold look may be taken at reducing the recent hike," he said.\u000aHe is the second Union Minister after Defence Minister A K Antony to have expressed unhappiness at the petrol price increase. Mr Antony had on Wednesday criticised the hike saying it was "not a correct step" and the oil companies should have shown some "propriety" before taking the decision.\u000aCutting across party lines, leaders have voiced their dissent over the recent petrol price hike. Nationwide protests by Opposition as well as some of the UPA allies, followed by NDA's strike on May 31 clearly put pressure on the government to act.\u000aEven after the announcement, key UPA allies and the Opposition are not happy with the reduction in petrol prices by the state-run oil companies. Dubbing the R two per litre cut in price as 'token', UPA ally Trinamool Congress as well as other opposition parties demanded a 'complete rollback' and said they would not settle for anything less.\u000aReacting to the state-run oil companies to reduce petrol price, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said, "I am not happy at the cut in petrol price by R two per litre. It is not enough. It is still a burden on the common man. There should have been a total rollback of the hike."\u000aTerming the reduction in prices as 'totally inadequate', CPI National Secretary D Raja also demanded the oil companies should go for a 'complete rollback' because they had effected "such an outrageously steep hike when international crude prices were declining".\u000aMaintaining that the government's view that it did not have any role in the price fixation for petrol due to de-regulation was 'ridiculous', Mr Raja said the oil companies have been following the government diktats regularly. "Otherwise, why did they not raise the prices when Parliament was in session," said Mr Raja. He said the decision came two days after nationwide protests by Left and other parties.\u000aCPI(M) Politbureau said the partial rollback was "unacceptable" and Left parties will continue their agitation for reversal of the price increase.\u000aBJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy also pressed for a 'total rollback' and wondered whether the hike of R 6 per litre after the partial rollback was 'acceptable' to the UPA allies. "I want to know whether they (UPA allies) are worth this," Mr Rudy said. He said people of the country are not satisfied with the token rollback and will teach the UPA a "lesson in the coming days".\u000aTamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa termed the partial rollback as an "eyewash" and demanded a complete rollback. In a statement, the AIADMK supremo said, "This small reduction will not soothe people's anger. It will continue to be a burden on poor and middle class".\u000aShe said the decision by the Congress-led UPA to reduce the hike by R two reminded her of the Tamil proverb, "feeding popcorns to the hungry elephant." Recalling her earlier criticism, Ms Jayalalithaa said petrol prices were hiked, when people were already burdened by the price rise because of the Centre's "wrong economic policies."\u000aOdisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik too dismissed the partial rollback as 'meaningless'. Mr Patnaik said, "We demand complete roll-back in the hike effected in the price of petrol by the central government recently."\u000aBJD had observed a state-wide bandh on May 31 seeking complete roll-back of petrol price hike and party workers had hit the streets to press for the demand. Mr Patnaik too had participated in the demonstrations against the petrol price hike terming it as a burden on the common people.\u000aHowever, leaders in Congress have heaved a sigh of relief after drawing flak from allies as well the Opposition over the steep hike in petrol prices earlier. "We are happy that the price of petrol has been reduced by R 2.02 per litre. It will give relief to the common man. Our party has great concern for Aam Admi," party spokesperson Rashid Alvi said.\u000a

VSigh outside the Delhi High Court\u000aNew Delhi:  Women rights' groups have flayed Delhi High court's observation that sexual relations between a legally wedded husband and wife, "even if forcible, is not rape", saying this will lead to the rise in incidents of marital rape.\u000aExpressing concern, the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) said that this verdict will have a very negative impact on women, especially married women, as it will encourage and perpetuate the alarmingly increasing menace of marital rape.\u000a"The verdict and position of the court is nothing but the manifestation of the patriarchal mindset which always stands in the way of gender equality," said NFIW General Secretary, Annie Raja.\u000a"When the entire women's movement and the people who believe in the importance of gender equality is campaigning and agitating to make marital rape a crime, NFIW consider that this verdict of the Delhi court is highly retrograde," Raja added.\u000aJagmati Sangwan, General Secretary of All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) also criticised the court's observation saying it is highly "regressive".\u000a"The observation is clearly contrary to the spirit of women's rights that are being consistently raised. Consent of an individual be married or single is important in sexual relationships," Sangwan said.\u000a"We have been consistently demanding that rape in marriage must be considered as violence and we have demanding that law should punish anyone who rapes in marriage. This observation has gone against our stand as a women's group," said Jyotsna Chatterjee, director of Joint Women's Programme.\u000aDelhi High Court on Monday had acquitted a youth who was accused of marrying a 21-year-old girl after serving her a sedative-laced drink and raping her\u000a

VSydney:  A brazen bird has snatched a video camera that was recording crocodiles in northwest Australia and took it on a 110-kilometer (70-mile) journey.\u000aWildlife rangers in Western Australia's remote Kimberley region released fascinating footage on Monday that reveals the sea eagle's caper. The bird's flapping wings can be seen as it grabs the device and soars across the landscape. The eagle later poses for a selfie, poking its face into the camera lens.\u000aRangers placed the motion-sensor camera along a river in May, hoping to capture images of crocodiles. The camera disappeared soon after.\u000aRanger Roneil Skeen told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that another ranger recently found the camera near a river about 110 kilometers (70 miles) from where it vanished. The footage inside revealed the real culprit.\u000a

VVideo game publisher Electronic Arts said on Thursday it halted development on upcoming projects of its "Battlefield 4" game to fix technical problems that have plagued the title recently, taking its stock down as much as 8 percent.\u000a\u000aGamers playing "Battlefield 4" - a military-style shooter that is the company's most-anticipated holiday title - have been complaining of crashes and online connectivity issues since its October launch.\u000a\u000aShares of Electronic Arts finished down 6 percent at $21.01. The 8 percent drop earlier in the session was the biggest since March.\u000a\u000a"We're not moving onto future projects or expansions until we sort out all the issues with Battlefield 4," Electronic Arts said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe company had planned five "Battlefield 4" expansion packs with additional content for next year without announcing release dates.\u000a\u000aElectronic Arts has temporarily put development on upcoming titles on hold to give current problems full attention, an Electronic Arts spokesman said.\u000a\u000a"The work being done to stabilize Battlefield 4 does not impact our release schedule for future titles," he added.\u000a\u000aSince the game launched on platforms, including the new PlayStation 4 from Sony Corp and Xbox One from Microsoft Corp, sales have been weaker than expected, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a research note this week.

VWashington:  There is greater room for Indo-US cooperation on space security issues, as India, which is a pioneer in many space related issues, has much to give to the international community, a top American official has said.\u000a"We see a strong role for greater US-India cooperation on space security issues, in the Asia-Pacific and internationally," said Frank A Rose, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, at the National Space Symposium.\u000aUS President Barack Obama had said in 2010 that the relationship between India and America will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century, Rose recalled.\u000a"While India has long focused on using space for the benefit of its people, as an established spacefaring nation with close ties to other regional space actors and emerging spacefaring nations, we see a strong role for Indian leadership in regional and multilateral space fora, where India has much to give, and also to gain," he said.\u000a"It is clear that there are significant areas of strategic convergence between India and the United States on space issues. This is why, in 2011, we launched the first US-India space security discussions as part of an effort to ensure that our two countries exchange views on this increasingly important domain," the official said.\u000aHe said the US is not only looking to strengthen its current alliances and partnerships, but to forge deeper ties with emerging spacefaring nations.\u000a"That is why I've spent a great deal of time in Asia in the past two years, discussing space security issues with my counterparts in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our increasing engagement with ASEAN members is part of a broader effort by the United States to deepen our commitment to the region and to work with all nations to ensure a sustainable and secure space environment," he said.\u000aAnother pillar of US approach to the rebalance is building a constructive relationship with China, he said.\u000a"There are few diplomatic, economic, or security challenges in the world that can be addressed without China at the table, including the issues confronting the space environment. To that end, we are also trying to engage China on space security bilaterally and multilaterally," Rose said.\u000a"Both the United States and China have an interest in maintaining the long-term sustainability of the space environment, especially limiting the creation of long-lived space debris," he said.\u000a"To this end, we are working to establish a direct line of communication between US and Chinese officials in order to provide the Chinese with timely conjunction notifications.\u000aAdditionally, it is important that we discuss space security issues bilaterally given our common interests in preventing misconceptions, mistrust, and miscalculations," Rose said.\u000a

VKeira is reportedly expecting her first child with husband James Righton\u000aBritish actress Keira Knightley is reportedly pregnant with her first child.\u000aKnightley is expecting her first child with husband James Righton, the co-vocalist and keyboardist for London-based band Klaxons, whom she married last year, multiple sources have confirmed to New York Post's Page Six.\u000aThe 29-year-old beauty fuelled rumors of a pregnancy as she stepped out at the Moet British Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday night and appeared to stay away from alcohol. The famously svelte star appeared at her husband's side in an embroidered and billowy, ivory fur-trimmed dress very different from her usual fitted style.\u000aPregnancy rumours first emerged in November when Star magazine reported that she and Righton were expecting and it was a happy surprise for the couple.\u000a"Keira and her stylist have been putting together looks that hide her growing bump," a source said.\u000aIt was announced Wednesday that her role as codebreaker Joan Clarke opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in wartime drama "The Imitation Game" had earned her a nomination for the prestigious Screen Actors Guild Awards, which are seen as an indicator for upcoming Oscar nods.\u000a

VEastman Kodak, which is planning to auction 1,100 digital patents, received two bids from investor groups including Apple Inc and Google Inc of between $150 million and $250 million, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.\u000a\u000aBankrupt Kodak is selling the patents, which it believes could be worth $2.6 billion, in order to repay creditors. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January after failing to keep up as consumers and rivals shifted to digital photography from film photography.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for the company declined to discuss the report in detail, citing court-ordered confidentiality surrounding the auction process.\u000a\u000a"Kodak believes that speculation about the details and potential outcome of the auction is inappropriate," spokeswoman Stefanie Goodsell said on Monday.\u000a\u000aBids can rise quickly in bankruptcy auctions. Nortel Networks Inc in 2011 sold its patent portfolio for $4.5 billion after initial bids came in at just $900 million.

VNew Delhi:  Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's grey Pakistan Airforce aircraft landed at Delhi's Palam Airport at around noon. He is currently at the 7 Race Course Road residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, where, over a lunch of mini dosas, biryani and much more, the two countries are expected to lay the road ahead for their relationship. Sources say Congress president Sonia Gandhi is not attending the lunch.\u000aAccompanying him is son Bilawal Zardari and 13 other family members in his 40-member delegation. He was received at the Airport by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal. Bilwal tweeted, " "AOA India Peace be with you. I have just landed in Delhi. 1st ever visit."\u000aMr Zardari and Dr Singh are meeting today after almost three years - they last met in Yekaterinburg Russia in 2009. There may be no dramatic announcements today; Mr Zardari is on a private visit to the Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Dargah at Ajmer and Delhi is a diplomatic stopover. Sources say there will be a one-on-one meeting between Dr Singh and Mr Zardari before the lunch that the former hosts. There are no delegation level talks scheduled.\u000aThough there is no structured agenda for talks, Mr Zardari is expected to invite Dr Singh to Pakistan by the end of this year. Sources said trade, education and culture could be part of the talks between the two leaders. An easing of the visa regime could be discussed, they said. Power from Punjab to Pakistan and border trade could also be discussed, the sources said, adding that other issues would be left to foreign-minister-level talks later.\u000aThe Indian PM is also expected to raise concern on terrorism and sources said, also the issue of Hafiz Saeed, seen as the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and who now has a 10-million-dollar bounty on his head, announced by the US last week.\u000aAhead of the visit, however, President Zardari said he did not expect the issue of Hafiz Saeed to be the focus of his meeting with Dr Singh in New Delhi. "My stance on Saeed is not different from that of my government. My visit to India is of a religious nature and I do not think Manmohan Singh will make me sit (and discuss only) this issue," Mr Zardari said in Lahore yesterday. India wants Saeed, who is a free man in Pakistan, arrested and prosecuted for his role in the Mumbai attacks of 2008. Pakistan has repeatedly said it needs more evidence, which India insists it has handed over.\u000aThe big question then, will the lunch meeting today go beyond a mere photo op?\u000aAs photo ops go, the one that seems to have created most buzz is a GenNext meeting. At lunch, Bilawal Zardari, the 24-year-old son of Mr Zardari will meet Rahul Gandhi. Mr Zardari's contingent includes Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik and Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani.\u000aBy 3 pm Mr Zardari's entourage is scheduled to leave for Jaipur in a special aircraft, from where a short chopper ride will land them in Ajmer at about 4.10 pm. From the Ajmer helipad, it is a 12.3 km drive to the Dargah.\u000aThere is huge security in Ajmer and at the famous shrine, where Mr Zardari is expected to spend about 45 minutes. In that time, the Dargah will be closed to all other visitors. About 1,500 policemen have been posted in and around the Dargah; the security arrangements include rapid response teams and counter-terrorism units. Security inspections were on till late last night in Ajmer.\u000aMr Zardari last visited Ajmer in 2005 with his wife Benazir Bhutto. She had visited the Dargah in 2003 and prayed to Garib Nawaz for the release of her husband; Mr Zardari was in prison then. Once he was released, both visited the shrine two years later.\u000aFrom Ajmer, Mr Zardari leaves for Jaipur and then Delhi and then straight out to Lahore.\u000aAs he heads to Delhi, Mr Zardari faces criticism from back home for going ahead with his India visit despite an avalanche in Siachen burying over 120 Pakistani soldiers. \u000a Yesterday, up to 135 people, mostly Pakistani soldiers, were buried after the avalanche hit a Pakistan army camp in the mountainous Siachen area, known as the world's highest battleground. No survivors have been found even after a huge all-day search involving more than 150 soldiers, sniffer dogs, and helicopters.\u000aPakistanis tweeted, "How can #Zardari visit #India when a great tragedy has just struck#Pakistan? We've lost 120+ of our brave men" and "#Zardari did the same when the floods struck. No respect for national tragedies. Hopeless dictator - self claimed." \u000a Last night, Mr Zardari met Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar at the Governor's House in Lahore. They discussed issues that were outstanding with New Delhi, Pakistan media reports said.\u000a Since their last meeting in 2009, both Dr Singh and Mr Zardari have been bogged down by their own internal crises, but have quietly pushed the bilateral dialogue forward, with the prime ministers of both countries meeting. The India-Pakistan dialogue is back on track, especially with positive moves on trade and officials say the lunch meeting will be a chance for the President and the PM to touch base and review where things stand. Since it is not a formal meeting, diplomats say it gives them more room to informally discuss the road ahead and perhaps pave the way for a visit by the PM to Pakistan. The PM recently said he was ready to go if the countries did something solid.\u000aMr Zardari's 40-member delegation includes interior minister Rehman Malik and officials say that while the larger issue of terrorism will be discussed, the $10 million bounty on Hafiz Saeed will also come up. Opposition parties are watching closely and will keep pressure on. BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, "the talks can't be for the sake of talks. Zardari is welcome as a visitor or a tourist but we have to be heard. The UPA was the first to jump to talks with Pakistan soon after 26/11, with promises made of bringing perpetrators to justice. But nothing happened, they are freely roaming around in Pakistan."\u000aPakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said last week in the Pakistan Parliament that Hafiz Saeed is an "internal issue" of Pakistan. Mr Gilani further said that any evidence against Hafiz Saeed should be provided to Pakistan so that it can be examined by the country's independent judiciary.\u000a

VSeoul:  South Korean recovery workers strengthened a ring of netting around a sunken ferry Monday to try to prevent corpses drifting away as dive teams recovered 11 more bodies, raising the death toll to 260.\u000aA total of 42 people remain unaccounted for, 19 days after the 6,825-tonne Sewol capsized and sank with 476 people on board -- most of them schoolchildren.\u000aWorkers in fishing boats strengthened netting around the scene of the disaster off the southwestern island of Jindo, amid concerns that powerful currents may have pulled some bodies into the open sea.\u000aThe operation followed a meeting at a Jindo harbour Sunday between President Park Geun-Hye and the relatives of passengers still missing.\u000aThey are insisting that all the bodies should be recovered before efforts begin to raise the ferry.\u000aThe search has been hampered by strong currents and waves, with dive teams working in challenging and sometimes hazardous conditions.\u000aThey must grope their way down guide ropes to the sunken ship, struggling through narrow passageways and rooms littered with floating debris in silty water.\u000aAs days go by, personal belongings and other items from the ship have been spotted further and further away, fuelling concern that some victims may never be found.\u000aLast week bodies were retrieved up to four kilometres (two miles) away from the site, and bedding material from the ship was found as far as 30 kilometres away.\u000aThe ferry sinking is one of South Korea's worst peacetime disasters, made all the more shocking by the loss of so many young lives.\u000aOf those on board, 325 were students from the same high school in Ansan city just south of Seoul.\u000aPublic anger has focused on the captain and crew members who abandoned the ship while hundreds were trapped inside.\u000aThere is also fury at the authorities as more evidence emerges of lax safety standards and possible corruption among state regulators.\u000aThe captain and 14 of his crew have been arrested. Prosecutors have arrested three officials from the ferry operator -- Chonghaejin Marine Co -- on charges of loading the ferry well beyond its legal limit.\u000aNorth Korea offered condolences over the tragedy a week after the ferry sank, but on Monday used the incident as an opportunity to criticise Park.\u000aShe is "the very person who is responsible for the disaster", it said, adding South Korea would continue to see similar accidents unless she steps down.\u000aThe sinking was "a man-made calamity caused by... incompetence and irresponsibility" of the South Korean government, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary.\u000a"As long as Park Geun-Hye, the incarnation of immorality, flunkyism and treachery... is there, nobody guarantees that a second and third 'Sewol' disaster will not happen," it said.\u000a

VMumbai:\u000aThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by global search engine Google, the government said on Monday.\u000aIn a written reply in Parliament, minister of state for corporate affairs R.P.N. Singh said CCI has received information for contravention of section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002, by Google.\u000aThe section pertains to the abuse of dominant position by a market player.\u000a"The CCI, which is a quasi-judicial regulator body, has ordered an investigation in the matter of director general, CCI," he said, replying to a query whether CCI has launched a probe on a complaint filed by NGO CUTS International.\u000aIn February, another company Bharat Matrimony, had filed a complaint against Google alleging that the multinational company has abused its dominance by engaging in discriminatory and retaliatory practices relating to AdWords.\u000aThe AdWords programme, in which Google sells keywords to advertisers and displays them in the form of short ads online, is a big money spinner for the company. In 2011, the advertising segment comprised 96 per cent of Google's $38 billion revenue.\u000a

VLondon:  Queen Elizabeth II has switched bearskin hats for turbans outside Buckingham Palace, where Sikh soldiers have begun guarding the monarch and her treasures.\u000aChanging the Guard ceremony attracts thousands of tourists every day outside Buckingham palace. But onlookers have never seen this sight before as the guards who have the honour of guarding the Queen dressed in all their finery, one of them is a turbaned Sikh.\u000aTwenty-six-year-old Signaler Simranjit Singh was the first one to join ceremonial public duties at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Palace and the Tower in May this year. Lance Corporal Sarvjit Singh, 28, joined him a month ago.\u000a"Any Indians who see us are very proud of us. They cheer for us. It's pride for all Indians in this country," said Signaler Simranjit Singh, Member of British Army.\u000a"Any Asian place we go to, they ask us if we are in the Indian army and we say no British army. They ask us how. I think we can take the Sikhs to the place they were at in the British army during the first and second world war," said Lance Corporal Sarvjit Singh.\u000aUsually it is the Household Div that guards the Queen but when they are out on operational duties, other regiments step in. That is how Signaler Simranjit Singh of the Royal Signals regiment and Lance Corporal Sarvjit Singh of the Army Air Corp have become the first turbaned Sikh British soldiers to guard the Queen.\u000aThe two turbans amongst the many berets is also a result of the British army's active efforts to increase diversity.\u000a

VWashington:  The US government has lowered the age at which girls can buy the morning-after contraceptive pill without a prescription to 15 years.\u000aThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday announced to approve a contraceptive known as Plan B or popular as "morning after pill" for all women 15 and older.\u000aThe announcement is expected to stir the controversy among conservatives who consider it another form of abortion.\u000aIn a statement, the FDA said the approval of Plan B One-Step for use without a prescription by women 15 years of age and older is based on an actual use study and label comprehension data submitted by Teva showing that women age 15 and older understood that the product was not for routine use and would not protect them against sexually-transmitted diseases.\u000aThese data also established that Plan B One-Step could be used properly within this age group without the intervention of a health care provider.\u000a"Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States," said FDA Commissioner Margaret A Hamburg.\u000a"The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease," Hamburg said in a statement.\u000aFDA said because the product will not protect a woman from HIV or AIDS or other sexually-transmitted diseases, it is important that young women who are sexually active remember to see a health care provider for routine checkups.\u000aUntil this decision the pill, Plan B One-Step, which is used after sexual intercourse to help prevent pregnancy, was available without a prescription only for ages 17 and older.\u000aBesides lowering the age restriction, the new rule addresses concerns of women who were unable to get the pill if their drugstore's pharmacy counter happened to be closed. Now, Plan B One-Step will be available in drugstore aisles where family planning or women's health products are displayed.\u000aThe packaging will include a product code that, when scanned by a cashier, will indicate that the customer's proof of age is required. To try to prevent theft, the manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has arranged for each box to have a security tag, the drug agency said.\u000a

VTechnological advancement has turned hidden cameras so tiny that they are virtually impossible to detect, says an expert who warns that cameras in changing rooms and toilets are far more common than people realise.\u000a\u000aAccording to Julian Claxton, a surveillance expert whose company, Jayde Consulting, conducts sweeps for recording devices, organisations are typically oblivious to the presence of hidden cameras and, on the odd occasions they do find them, are reluctant to come forward to inform police for fear of reputational damage, The Age reported.\u000a\u000aClaxton mentions two instances in Sydney this year. One case involved a hidden camera in the changing room of a Sydney private school, and in the other case a camera was placed in the toilet of a building in Haymarket, New South Wales.\u000a\u000aClaxton said that while mobile phones were easy to spot, there were scores of tiny recording devices available on eBay that were small enough to fit into the head of a screw, buttons, pens or cigarette packets.\u000a\u000a"One-inch squared would be a big one," he said.\u000a\u000aThey have become so advanced that one 2.5-inch camera available on eBay has a wireless transmitter on it enabling the offenders to view the footage from a distance without ever having to retrieve the device. The cameras can either be connected to small batteries or permanent power sources.\u000a\u000aClaxton said the problem was not only compounded by the fact that cameras were getting smaller, but also by the ability to record significantly more footage on a single card than ever before.\u000a\u000aeBay's head of communications for Asia-Pacific, Daniel Feiler, said that, if the government introduced legislation banning the sale of hidden camera devices, eBay would look at getting them removed but as of today these were legitimate products.

VSingapore: Oil futures dipped on Thursday after Saudi Arabia trimmed the price of its flagship physical crude to Asia, but were still near more than three-month highs following a drop in U.S. crude inventories.\u000aU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at $49.60 per barrel at 0677 GMT, down 23 cents, or 0.46 percent, from their last settlement.\u000aBrent futures were down 20 cents, or 0.39 percent, at $51.66 per barrel.\u000aBoth contracts hit June highs on Wednesday after U.S. data showed that crude stockpiles fell 3 million barrels last week to 499.74 million barrels. Despite this, stocks were still close to all-time highs.\u000aTraders said Thursday's fall reflected weaker physical crude after top exporter Saudi Arabia cut the price of its crudes to Asia for November in a sign that the global fuel glut persists.\u000aAnother potential cap on prices comes from the United States.\u000aJeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said that at $50 a barrel for WTI, U.S. shale drillers, who have spent much of the year cutting back production amid low prices, may start bringing back rigs.\u000aOverall, however, analysts said that the market was well supported at current levels, especially because of a planned output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\u000a"We expect that Saudi will shoulder the bulk of the production cuts with a reduction of 5 percent or 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd), with other Gulf States cutting by 0.3 million bpd. With Iran, Libya and Nigeria getting a 'pass', remaining cuts will be on the shoulders of some of the less reliable members in OPEC," Bernstein Energy said in a note on Thursday.\u000aHowever, Bernstein added that there was still some "skepticism that an agreement will hold ... (as) the track record of OPEC over the past 30 years has not been good."\u000aAnalysts said that there were also risks of forced supply disruptions.\u000a"Oil prices seem headed for higher levels in the coming period," Global Risk Management said in a report this week, pointing to the risk of "several oil producing countries struggling to increase or even keep production at current levels due to unrest/oil facility wreckages and lack of industry investments."\u000aBarring such disruptions, analysts did not expect prices to shoot up much further as production remains high even with an OPEC cut.\u000a"Resilient production in the U.S. and Russia will postpone crude market rebalancing and keep the market in surplus into 2017," BMI Research said.\u000a"With an insufficient demand response to counteract strong supply, the result is a downward revision of our 2017 Brent forecast to $55 per barrel from $57 per barrel," BMI said.\u000a© Thomson Reuters 2016\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VNew Delhi :\u000aIndia today moved the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the US for imposing duties on import of certain Indian steel products.\u000a"On 12 April 2012, India requested consultations with the US under the dispute settlement system concerning the latter's countervailing duties on certain steel products from India," the WTO said.\u000aAccording to WTO website, more details on the trade dispute will be made available in the next few days.\u000aCountervailing duties are imposed to neutralise the subsidies on products given by the exporting nation.\u000aThe request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the WTO.\u000aRecently India had also dragged the US to the WTO challenging the visa fee hike which allegedly discriminates against the Indian software companies sending professionals to the US on short-term contracts.\u000aEarlier in March, Washington had also dragged New Delhi to the global trade body against India's ban on imports of certain American farm products, including poultry meat and eggs. The US had termed the ban as "unjustified" health-safety worries.\u000aConsultations give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter and to find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation.\u000aAfter 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel.\u000a

VApple quietly updated its MacBook Air lineup last week and dropped prices by $100 across the board, and now the first benchmark test results are available. The only difference in published specifications between the outgoing models and the new ones is a 100MHz CPU speed bump, but Apple appears to have made at least one other modification, by using slower SSDs. The company does not consider these refreshed units to be all-new models.\u000a\u000aBoth the 11-inch and 13-inch versions use the same CPU; a fourth-generation Intel Core i5 running at 1.4GHz. The variants launched last year used the same CPU, but running at 1.3GHz. The change is consistent with Intel's periodic refreshes of its CPU lineup as yields of higher speed processors increase over time after a new generation's launch.\u000a\u000aHowever, Apple seems to have changed the supplier of the SSDs used in the MacBook Air. Apple uses PCI Express SSDs but does not disclose the exact model or manufacturer, and has often used components sourced from different manufacturers in different variants of the same model. All other specifications, including the integrated Intel HD 5000 graphics processor, amount of RAM, and choice of SSD sizes, are unchanged.\u000a\u000aApple-centric news websites Macworld and Apple Insider have published early benchmark results which demonstrate speed differences between the CPUs and storage subsystems of the 2013 and 2014 MacBook Airs. While Macworld ran its own Speedmark test, Apple Insider had a roundup of Geekbench scores which appeared in the tool's online database\u000a\u000aApple Insider describes the changes as "relatively small but still measurable". While the 2013 MacBook Air scored 2,461 and 4,615 in single-core and multi-core tests respectively, the 2014 refresh scored 2,532 and 4,781 respectively.\u000a\u000aSpeedmark revealed improvements of between 2 and 5 percent in applications such as Photoshop, Aperture, Handbreak, Cinebench CPU, and PCMark 8. However, it took nearly twice as long to copy data to and from the new MacBook Airs' SSDs. In tests involving file compression and decompression, the new Airs were up to three times as slow. Macworld ran further benchmarks to test the storage subsystem and found significant reductions in read and write speeds.\u000a\u000aApple announced price cuts of $100 for its new MacBook Airs in the USA, but that translated to only Rs. 2,000 in India . The 2014 releases are available starting at Rs. 65,900 for the 11-inch model with a 128GB solid-state drive.\u000a\u000aApple is also reportedly working on a much more significant update for later this year, which could feature a new 12-inch screen size and an even thinner body.

VAn eighth-grade student in the US received burn injuries when her iPhone blew and caught fire in her back pocket while she was in her school classroom.\u000a\u000aThe girl, who has not been named, received the burns on the thigh and back when her iPhone started smouldering in her pocket during the first period of her school day, which happened to be French class.\u000a\u000aThe teenage student of Middle School of the Kennebunks in Maine was treated at a Southern Maine Health Care hospital in Biddeford on Friday, and reportedly released after about 45 minutes.\u000a\u000aThe girl said her pants started burning after she sat down with the phone in her back pocket and heard a pop, principal Jeffrey Rodman was quoted by the New York Daily News as saying.\u000a\u000aRodman added: "Immediately, smoke starts billowing from around the student. She knew right away something was wrong and, in a panic, knew her pants were on fire caused by the cellphone. It was sensitive. She knew she was kind of in a tough situation."\u000a\u000aRodman said the student quickly raced to the corner and took off her pants. A teacher came to her rescue, wrapping her in a blanket before rescue workers arrived on the scene. The classroom had to be vacated, and the student was treated for minor burns.\u000a\u000aRodman said the girl's pants had multiple burn holes and there was so much smoke in the room that a window had to be opened.\u000a\u000aHe said the cause of the phone's explosion is under investigation by the state Fire Marshall.

The Olympian is charged with premeditated murder.\u000aVorster said she interviewed Pistorius and some of his family members and friends.\u000a

VMumbai:  Witnesses at the Qasab trial on Friday clearly identified him as the man who killed Tukaram Ombale, the man who the entire nation hailed as a martyr and a hero after he took on the terrorists unarmed.\u000aThe last moments of 26/11 martyr Tukaram Ombale recounted in court by the constable who was part of the police team that captured Qasab.\u000a"We spotted a car coming towards us. We shouted and asked it to stop. The car stopped 50 feet from the barricade. We asked the driver to turn on the inside lights. He ignored our warning and started the wiper spray making it difficult to see inside. The driver started the car and attempted a U-turn, but the divider prevented him. I and six others rushed and surrounded the car. Two people inside the car raised their hands in surrender.\u000aWhen I approached the driver's side, the driver started firing at me. I fired back. The person was injured. The person sitting next to him, opened the door, leaped out of the car and flattened himself on the road," recounted witness in the court.\u000aASI Tukaram Ombale and API Sanjay Govilkar moved towards the car. The person who got out of the car fired at Ombale then Ombale pounced on him.\u000aOmbale and Govilkar sustained injuries because of the firing. Other members of the team assaulted the terrorist and took him into custody.\u000aOn Friday Ombale identified Qasab.\u000aSpecial Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam to constable: Are the terrorists in the courtroom?\u000aConstable: One of them, he is the one.\u000aWhen Ombale was identifying him, Qasab simply kept smiling. His lawyer says too much should not be read into the expression because he does not understand the proceedings.\u000aQasab's lawyer now stands accused of trying to delay the trial after refusing to accept documentary evidence and forcing witness to be called in.\u000a"This was also the tactic used in the 1993 blasts case and that case took so long," said Ujjwal Nikam, Special Public Prosecutor.\u000aOn Monday, Kazmi will have his chance to discredit this witness but he will have to be careful not to tarnish a martyr's memory.\u000a

VActivists claim that despite presence of wildlife and rare plants in the area, clearances have been given for the project.\u000aAhmedabad:  Jayanti Bhai, a 45-year-old farmer in Dudhal village in Gujarat has been trying to get a new power connection for his fields for the last five years but the wait seems endless.\u000a"I applied in 2011 but I've been told that the list is long and I will have to wait till 2018. I doubt if I will get the connection even by that time," lamented Jayanti Bhai.\u000aBut barely a kilometre from Jayanti Bhai's fields and little over a kilometre from the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, a 400 acre-plot belonging to Wildwoods Resort and Realities already has a power connection despite no commercial activity.\u000aA controversial tourism project is supposed to start at the plot. The project is backed by a company owned by Dakesh Shah and Amol Sheth - business partners of Anar Patel, daughter of Chief Minister Anandiben Patel.\u000aWildwoods had obtained 250 acres of government land in 2009 allegedly at a throwaway price and later bought a further 150 acres from private farmers in 2011.\u000aBut according to activists opposing the project, the project is too close to the eco-sensitive Gir sanctuary. They also claim that despite presence of wildlife and rare plants in the area, clearances have been given for the project.\u000a"The state forest department gave its nod to the project in 2009 without carrying out any on spot inspection," alleged environmental activist Bhagabhai.\u000aIronically, some people are still waiting for clearances. Anirudh Makrana, a resident of Dudhal village, said that he applied for a clearance for a resort barely a kilometre from the Wildwood project site in 2008 but still has not received it.\u000a"First I was told that my site is 1.85 km from the sanctuary. I filed a review that showed it was about 3.85 km from the site but despite that the permission has not been given," said Mr Makrana.\u000aBut the government insists the deal and the clearances have been above board. It has filed an affidavit in the high court following a petition challenging the deal.\u000aAll necessary clearance has been given following due process of laws and even the valuation of the land has been done as per rates arrived at by duly authorised evaluation committees, it maintains.\u000aManagement of Wildwoods has also denied any wrongdoing.\u000aBut the statement has barely dispirited an Opposition eager to seize an opportunity to take on the government.\u000a

He has not been keeping well and is usually escorted by his assistant. But a little after 5 am, he left his brother's home alone for a morning walk. Around four hours later, there was no sign of him, and his worried family called the police. A missing person's case was filed. 20 police teams and RSS workers searched the area for him.\u000aThe police located him and escorted him home. He seemed confused.\u000aThe Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh is the parent body of the main opposition party, the BJP. Mr Sudershan headed the organisation between 2000 and 2009.\u000aMr Sudershan belongs to Karnataka, but after retiring as RSS chief, he has been living in Bhopal.\u000a

VNew Delhi: Assuring India Inc of NDA's commitment to carry forward economic reforms, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the government will come out with more steps to rationalise subsidies.\u000a"I had a series of meeting with the Expenditure Management Commission. They are effectively working on some very valuable suggestions with regard to rationalisation of subsidies...\u000a"In the next few, even months...may be earlier than that they will be able to come out with some interim recommendations to us so that we can proceed with rationalisation in that direction", Mr Jaitley said.\u000aRecalling the government's decision to link the diesel prices with market price, the minister said that it would help in reducing the subsidy burden of the government.\u000aBesides, the government has recently decided to give direct cash subsidy on pilot basis to LPG customers in select cities.\u000aThe Centre had set up a Commission under former RBI Governor Bimal Jalan to suggest steps to rationalise subsidy and help the government in effectively bringing down the fiscal deficit.\u000aThe government currently provides various kinds of subsidies which run into lakhs of crores of rupees. It was pegged at Rs. 2.51 lakh crore for 2014-15.\u000aSpeaking at the conclave, Mr Jaitley expressed confidence that the government would be able to push the Insurance and the GST bills in the current session of Parliament.\u000aOn the government's views on a joint session of Parliament to push the bills as it does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, he said: "We don't want to use the last resort of a joint session for legislations. But if it becomes inevitable that's a constitutional remedy."\u000a

The home team thrashed New Zealand by 178 runs to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series and win back the No. 1 Test ranking from Pakistan.\u000aKohli set a new benchmark for his team. Having started in the West Indies in July, India will play 17 Tests, 13 of them at home.\u000a

VShrien Dewani (Associated Press)\u000aCape town:  The family of a Swedish bride murdered on her honeymoon urged a South African court Wednesday to force her British husband to testify on charges that he had her killed.\u000a"Don't let Shrien Dewani walk away without giving us, South Africa and people from all over the world the full story," Anni Dewani's brother Anish Hindocha told a news conference.\u000aWestern Cape High Court Judge Jeannette Traverso will rule next Monday on an application by Dewani's lawyers to have the charges thrown out because of alleged weaknesses in the prosecution case.\u000aIt would be a "terrible development" if Dewani was allowed to leave South Africa "without explaining himself what happened on the night when my sister got murdered", Hindocha said.\u000aDewani, 34, is accused of masterminding the murder of 28-year-old Anni Dewani (nee Hindocha) during their honeymoon in South Africa in November 2010.\u000aProsecutors say he hired hitmen to kill her in a staged hijacking because, as a gay man, he felt forced into the marriage by family pressures.\u000aDewani says he is bisexual and loved Anni.\u000aBoth families -- the Dewanis and the Hindochas -- are of Indian origin, and have sat on opposite sides of the courtroom throughout weeks of testimony.\u000aHindocha, flanked by three of Anni's cousins from Britain and Sweden, pointed out that Dewani had insisted through his lawyers that he wanted to clear his name and would help the court with his own version of events.\u000a"Tell it then!" he demanded.\u000aThe sensational trial has had heavy media coverage locally, with members of the public launching a petition to have the judge removed from the case for allegedly showing bias against the prosecution.\u000aHindocha said the family had nothing to do with the petition.\u000aDewani returned to Britain within days of the murder and fought a three-year legal battle to avoid being extradited to South Africa, claiming he had mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress.\u000aBut he was sent back to South Africa in April, where he was found fit to stand trial.\u000aHe is being held at Cape Town's Valkenberg psychiatric hospital for the duration of the court hearing.\u000a

VPolling in progress in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam. (Press Trust of India)\u000aSrinagar/Jammu:  In a rerun of record polling in the first phase, 72 per cent voter turnout was registered in the second phase of the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir today. The 15.3 lakh electorate across five districts which went to polls, had ignored the boycott call by separatist groups.\u000aThe first phase of the five-phase polls for 15 seats on November 25 had witnessed a record 71.28 per cent polling. Today, 175 candidates -- including four ministers and 11 legislators -- were in fray for 18 seats.\u000a"The latest figure is 71 per cent. We expect these numbers to go up by 1-2 per cent further," Deputy Election Commissioner Vinod Zutshi told reporters in Delhi.\u000aMr Zutshi said "no untoward incident" took place and the entire event was peaceful. Of the five districts, two were in the Valley and three in Jammu. "Pretty heavy" voting was reported in Reasi and Udhampur districts.\u000aThe figures for voting today in the five districts stand thus: Reasi (80%), Udhampur (76%), Poonch (75%), Kupwara (68%) and Kulgam (above 60%).\u000aThere was a tight security cover in Kulgam and Kupwara districts following back-to-back attacks on two sarpanches by militants over the last two days, in which one was killed.\u000aOf the 18 constituencies, Handwara in north Kashmir and Kupwara district were in focus, from where separatist-turned-mainstream politician Sajad Gani Lone is making a debut in the assembly elections after his unsuccessful foray in the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.\u000aAlthough the cold weather conditions and heavy fog posed a hindrance in some areas in the early hours, voters started flocking the polling stations as the day progressed. Several elderly persons were among the voters.\u000aAlam Din, said to be 120 years old, voted at Poonch district's Salotri. He said he was voting for development.\u000aMohammad Rashid, and three of his relatives had to carry his maternal grandfather Mohammad Hussain, aged 107, from vote at Karmara polling station near the Line of Control (LoC).\u000aUndeterred by the threat of firing from across the border by Pakistani forces, sarpanch Mohammad Azam, along with 310 others, walked to the hypersensitive polling booth along LoC in Poonch district to cast vote for "ceasefire" and "development".\u000a

VFile photo: A Pakistani soldier near his outpost, Kalpani Base, in Pak's Dir province.\u000aIslamabad:  An avalanche smashed into a Pakistani army base on a Himalayan glacier along the Indian border on Saturday, burying around 100 soldiers, the military said.\u000aHelicopters, sniffer dogs and troops were deployed to the remote Siachen Glacier to rescue those trapped, according to a military statement.\u000aThe avalanche hit a battalion headquarters in the glacier's Gayari sector at 5:45 a.m, according to a security official who didn't give his name because he is not an official spokesman.\u000aSiachen is on the northern tip of the divided Kashmir region claimed by both India and Pakistan.\u000aBoth countries station thousands of troops there, who brave viciously cold temperatures, altitude sickness and high winds for months at a time. Troops have been deployed at elevations of up to 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) and have skirmished intermittently since 1984, though the area has been quiet since a cease-fire in 2003. The glacier is known as the world's highest battlefield.\u000aThe headquarters in Gayari is the main gateway through which troops and supplies pass on their to other more remote outposts in the sector. It is situated in a valley between two high mountains, close to a military hospital, according to an officer who was stationed there in 2003.\u000a"I can't comprehend how an avalanche can reach that place," said the officer, who didn't give his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media. "It was supposed to be safe."\u000aMore soldiers have died from the harsh weather than combat on the glacier, which was uninhabited before troops moved there.\u000aConflict there began in 1984 when India occupied the heights of the 78-kilometer (49-mile)-long glacier, fearing Pakistan wanted to claim the territory. Pakistan also deployed its troops.

There are so many people in the world who are looking at you and judging you. I just don't want that between me and my partner. And as respect to my partner, I shouldn't be talking about it," Parineeti Chopra said

VWashington/New Delhi:  "Even Obama listens (to) the speech of NaMo," says the caption of a doctored picture showing the US President watching a Narendra Modi speech on TV. The photograph is being circulated on social media.\u000aThe original photo was taken in January 2011 and captured President Obama in the White House watching a televised speech by then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\u000aIn the doctored picture, Mr Mubarak has been replaced by the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Mr Modi. The Gujarat Chief Minister is seen delivering a speech, which is being watched on a small television screen by Obama and his team.\u000aAmong others, the picture was shared by BJP Member of Parliament from Navasari in Gujarat C R Paatil.\u000aWhen contacted, Mr Patil said he was not aware that the photograph was morphed. He said it had been shared with him on Facebook and he had forwarded it without verifying its authenticity.\u000a

VGold prices witnessed their biggest one-day drop since 1983 on Monday as a selling frenzy that began last week gathered speed. In global markets, prices of the yellow metal plunged $140 to $1,361 an ounce, a decline of 9 per cent. Gold is now trading at its lowest price since February 2011.\u000aBack home, the key gold contract for April delivery recovered from the day's low of Rs. 25,270 and traded 0.6 per cent lower at Rs. 25,484 as of 11.10 a.m. on the MCX. April gold futures have plunged 14 per cent over the last five days, tracking the weak global cues.\u000aNDTV Profit spoke to two experts about the right strategy to trade in gold amid the current weakness. Here's what they have to say.\u000aGold prices may fall to Rs. 22,000\u000aKishore Narne, associate director and head of commodity and currency trading at Motilal Oswal Securities, said gold prices have strong support at Rs. 24,500 in the short term, but because of the panic selling it is tough to predict a bottom. (Watch: Gold prices may fall to Rs. 22,000)\u000aGold has been in a free fall since the crucial $1,540 support level was breached after a gap of two years, Mr Narne said, likely triggering off many stop losses below $1,500 levels, which may have led to the steep selloff.\u000aAlthough domestic gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) did not witness major outflows until March, that scenario may change this month. Also, because gold prices in India have lagged global prices, the correction may be more severe here.\u000aAn appreciation in the rupee will also have a big impact on gold prices as commodities are traded in dollar terms.\u000a"If the rupee appreciates to 50 against the dollar, gold prices may fall to Rs. 22,000," Mr Narne said. That may be the right time to buy, he added.\u000aTime for value investors to participate\u000aAjay Srivastava, MD of Dimensions Consulting has gone long on gold after the recent selloff, which he attributes to ETF blip, heavy sales and margin trading.\u000a"Gold prices will reach a point of inflection when you start to believe that value investing makes sense. Sure, gold prices can go down to Rs. 22,000 - Rs. 20,000, but then you need to weigh in the factor that yesterday in the actual bullion market you could not buy silver," Mr Srivastava said.\u000aThere is an inherent demand for gold in countries like India and China and this physical demand may support gold prices. The market also has a role to play; for example, you could not get silver yesterday because shopkeepers did not want to sell the metal at a Rs. 5,000 discount to what they bought it for, and so they shut shop, Mr Srivastava said. (Watch: Value investors should start buying gold)\u000aOver the past month, the difference in physical and financial gold in ETF has worked out to Rs. 3,000 per gram, which is not a healthy sign for markets. But the time for you to start nibbling into the market has come, he added.\u000aYou may not go the whole hog because we cannot call the bottom, but we know that physical demand is on our side, Mr Srivastava added.\u000a

VMumbai:\u000aRating agency Crisil said on Wednesday that corporates, especially those in the auto, aviation, consumer durables and oil sectors, will be "severely impacted" by the rupee depreciation due to large overseas debt and limited hedging.\u000aAdditionally, the depreciation, which has seen the rupee lose over 12.5 per cent since April to reach historic lows against US dollar, will also push input costs, Crisil said in a note.\u000a"Corporate India had forex debt outstanding of over $200 billion as of March 2013, of which close to 45 per cent is short-term debt. Moreover, only half their forex exposure is hedged," Crisil Research president Mukesh Agarwal said.\u000aHe said the current spate of depreciation and increased volatility has reduced the benefits of borrowing in the low-interest environment overseas.\u000aThe rupee has been sliding since May 20, ever since an announcement by the US Federal Reserve that it may pull back its liquidity-infusing government bond buys as the domestic employment situation improves.\u000aThe rupee touched a lifetime low of Rs. 61.21 to dollar during Monday's session, forcing the apex bank and market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to announce steps to curb speculative trades in currency derivatives.\u000aIt gained during Wednesday's session and closed at 59.66 against the dollar - a second day of rise.\u000a(Read: Rupee gains for second day, ends at 59.66)\u000aAutomobiles, auto components, airlines, consumer durables, oil marketing companies, and fertilisers will be impacted the most by the rupee fall.\u000aExport-oriented businesses like IT companies, pharmaceutical and ready-made garment exporters, crude oil producers and pure-play refineries may benefit.\u000a

VMumbai:  In the early 1960s, a young and handsome student in Pune University harboured a secret ambition: to become a star in Bollywood. Over the years, the Bollywood dreams of Vilasrao Dagadoji Deshmukh crumbled although he resembled an upcoming star of those times, Shatrughan Sinha, and whose dialogue delivery he imitated to regale friends.\u000aInstead, Mr Deshmukh became a rising star in politics, starting with his native Latur district. The double graduate-cum-lawyer became one of the youngest sarpanches at age 29 in 1974.\u000aHe had to battle huge odds but there was no looking back after that. A Congress loyalist, he went on to become Maharashtra Chief Minister twice and Union Minister too.\u000a"I have achieved all this despite powerful political opponents," Mr Deshmukh once told this writer, naming Sharad Pawar, soon after he was sworn-in the second time as the Maharashtra Chief Minister in 2004.\u000aThe kind of hate-hate relationship Deshmukh-Pawar had all these years -- both ambitious Marathas, hailing from the backward Marathwada and the prosperous western Maharashtra respectively - is hardly a secret.\u000aWinning all elections from 1980, barring in the 1995 assembly polls owing to suspected sabotage by party bigwigs, Mr Deshmukh started his ministerial stint from 1982 and held all important portfolios.\u000aDespite having been written off after his defeat in 1995, when the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance swept to power, Mr Deshmukh made a sensational comeback in 1999 winning with the highest margin in the state.\u000aWhen Sharad Pawar quit the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party, the party was desperate for a strong leader as the next chief minister. The mantle fell on Mr Deshmukh who ruled Maharashtra from 1999 to 2003.\u000aEven after he was moved to national politics as Congress general secretary, Mr Deshmukh's heart beat only for his home state. The Latur-born wanted to move back to Mumbai.\u000aThe opportunity came in 2004 when he bounced back as chief minister. He held the reins till he resigned following the 2008 Mumbai terror attack by Pakistani terrorists.\u000aIt was as Culture Minister that Mr Deshmukh acquired a love for the fine arts, music, dance, movies and drama, which remained his passion till the end.\u000aHe was once asked why so many Bollywood personalities crowded his office and residence. Mr Deshmukh replied: "Most of them want land somewhere or the other. If their case is genuine, the government considers it."\u000aA few years later, his name was dragged into a land allotment row involving filmmaker Subhash Ghai.\u000a During his tenure as chief minister, among the longest by a Congress leader, Mr Deshmukh always ensured a couple of important cultural items on his official menu.\u000aThough he was never identified as a member of any group within the Congress, he was great friends with the late Madhavrao Scindia, whom he considered as among his mentors.\u000aWhen Scindia was killed in a plane crash, Mr Deshmukh was at the Hyderabad airport lounge.\u000a As he got the news, he broke down.\u000aDuring the flight back home in a small aircraft, he recounted several treasured encounters he had with Scindia.\u000aOver the years, Mr Deshmukh had his share of political controversies, land scams and accusations of misusing his position. In 2009, as the Congress returned to power again nationally, he became a part of the Manmohan Singh government.\u000aAccording to his close friends, it was last year that his illness and its implications were detected. He started taking precautions, including lighter assignments.\u000aA matter of pride for him was his son Riteish, who fulfilled his dream of becoming a Bollywood star and later married Genelia D'Souza, an upcoming actress.\u000aHis friends hail Mr Deshmukh for his contribution in promoting arts and culture, the cooperative movement, education and strengthening the administration especially in rural areas.\u000a He would always say that he wanted to make Maharashtra the numero uno state in India, and dreamt of making Mumbai a Shanghai.\u000aThe 67-year-old died in a Chennai hospital on Tuesday... that dream forever incomplete.\u000a

It's a moment I will never forget as long as I live. My body was overtaken by emotion. I saw him and he was so calm and happy. He had a tear coming down and he wiped it away. I felt so good walking to him. It made me feel like a complete woman," she said. \u000a Lavigne added, "I wanted it to be over the top. I'm obsessed with castles and I love French decor and goth.

VTwo potentially harmful compounds were also found in many of the tested flavours. (Representational Image)\u000aWashington:  A flavouring chemical linked to cases of severe respiratory disease has been found in more than 75 per cent of flavoured electronic cigarettes and refill liquids tested by Harvard researchers.\u000aTwo other potentially harmful compounds were also found in many of the tested flavours, which included varieties with potential appeal to young people such as cotton candy, fruit squirts and cupcakes, researchers said.\u000aResearchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health tested 51 types of flavoured e-cigarettes and liquids sold by leading brands for the presence of diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-pentanedione, two related flavouring compounds that are listed as 'high priority,' which means they may pose a respiratory hazard in the workplace.\u000aEach e-cigarette was inserted into a sealed chamber attached to a lab-built device that drew air through the e-cigarette for eight seconds at a time with a resting period of 15 or 30 second between each draw. The air stream was then analysed.\u000aAt least one of the three chemicals was detected in 47 of the 51 flavours tested. Diacetyl was detected above the laboratory limit of detection in 39 of the flavours tested. Acetoin and 2,3-pentanedione were detected in 46 and 23 of the flavors, respectively.\u000a"Recognition of the hazards associated with inhaling flavouring chemicals started with 'Popcorn Lung' over a decade ago," said Joseph Allen, who led the study.\u000a"However, diacetyl and other related flavouring chemicals are used in many other flavors beyond butter-flavoured popcorn, including fruit flavours, alcohol flavours, and, we learned in our study, candy flavoured e-cigarettes," said Allen.\u000a"Since most of the health concerns about e-cigarettes have focused on nicotine, there is still much we do not know about e-cigarettes," said David Christiani, professor of environmental genetics.\u000a"In addition to containing varying levels of the addictive substance nicotine, they also contain other cancer-causing chemicals, such as formaldehyde, and as our study shows, flavouring chemicals that can cause lung damage," said Christiani.\u000aThere are currently more than 7,000 varieties of flavoured e-cigarettes and e-juice (liquid containing nicotine that is used in refillable devices) on the market. The findings were published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.\u000a

In any case we will fully comply with the government order."NSEL offers e-series contracts in gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, nickel and platinum.\u000aOn July 31, the NSEL suspended trade in all contracts except 'e-series' following the government's direction not to launch new contracts because of violation of some rules.\u000aUnder e-series contracts, retail investors can buy and sell commodities in demat form. This is a unique market segment, which functions like the cash segment in equities, but offers commodities in the demat form in smaller denominations.\u000aThe clearing and settlement, pay-in and pay-out mechanism on the NSEL is based on T+2 (settlement in 2 days) cycle.\u000a

VMumbai: The Nifty fell for a third consecutive day on Tuesday, closing at a one-month low, as investors cashed out positions tracking a selloff in Chinese markets, hurting blue-chips such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp.\u000aChinese shares plunged on Tuesday, sharply reversing course from a two-week rally fuelled in part by speculation the central bank would further ease policy, with a key stock index recording its biggest fall since the depths of the global financial crisis.\u000aAdding to the concerns, overseas investors turned net sellers, excluding the share sale by founders of Infosys on Monday. Foreign investors have invested about $16.6 billion so far this year, exchange and regulatory data showed.\u000a"This was an expected profit-taking. Fall in Chinese markets added fuel to the fall. However, we think it's a healthy correction. It's still a buy-on-dips market," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets.\u000aThe benchmark BSE Sensex closed 1.15 per cent lower at 27,797.01. The broader Nifty fell 1.16 per cent to end at 8,340.70, its lowest since November 7.\u000aExplorers took a hit. ONGC fell 4.4 per cent, its biggest since July 7 after crude prices tumbled to a five-year low. Cairn India fell 1.6 per cent.\u000aSesa Sterlite lost 5.2 per cent, adding to its 3.7 per cent fall in the previous session as iron ore prices hit multi-year lows.\u000aMetal stocks continued to fall for the second straight day after disappointing Chinese trade data. Tata Steel closed down 3.4 per cent, while Hindalco Industries ended 3 per cent lower.\u000aBanks also fell for the second straight day on profit-taking. State Bank of India closed down 2 per cent, while ICICI Bank ended 1 per cent lower.\u000aAmong the gainers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries rose 1.4 per cent and Ranbaxy Laboratories ended 3.6 per cent higher after India's antitrust regulator approved Sun's $3.2 billion bid to buy its smaller rival.\u000aJet Airways Ltd gained 6.2 per cent, tracking a fall in crude prices. Every $1/barrel fall in crude can boost the company's FY16 operational profit estimate by 4-5 per cent, analysts said.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VMumbai: Reliance Industries said on Friday it has entered a pact with Mexico's national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) to explore potential upstream oil and gas business opportunities in that country.\u000aThe deal comes as Mexico, the world's tenth-largest crude producer, is implementing sweeping reform of the energy sector that was approved earlier this year and that ended Pemex's decades-long monopoly.\u000aMexico's energy regulator last month said it seeks to lure over $50 billion in investment through 2018 to stem long-sliding crude production. Current production in Mexico is around 2.35 million barrels per day.\u000aPemex and Reliance, controlled by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, will also explore international markets for "value added opportunities", the Indian energy conglomerate said in a statement.\u000aMexico's Pemex has been trying to expand its presence in India and other markets beyond neighbouring United States. The Mexican oil giant has said it sees India and China as future growth markets for crude.\u000aPemex signed an agreement in September with ONGC Videsh, the overseas business unit of India's state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, to explore opportunities in Mexico's hydrocarbon sector.\u000aPemex was unavailable to comment outside of regular business hours on Friday.\u000aReliance, which operates the world's biggest refinery, said its tie-up with Pemex was in line with its strategy to expand its international asset base in regions with "attractive competitive opportunities."\u000aIn June, Ambani told a shareholders meeting that Reliance, which has invested more than $7 billion on joint ventures in the United States, was looking to expand its international presence beyond the world's largest economy.\u000aShares in Reliance, India's third-most valuable company with a market capitalisation of more than $50 billion, were up 0.7 per cent at Rs. 964.60 at 10:48 a.m., while the Nifty was up 0.12 per cent.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VTokyo:\u000aJapan's Nikkei average posted its biggest one-day fall in six weeks on Wednesday, a day after hitting a six-year closing high as investors pocketed gains ahead of the U.S. November jobs report due later this week.\u000aWednesday's decline came as the yen bounced off a six-month low versus the dollar and a four-year trough against the euro, with investors trimming their bearish bets on the Japanese currency before Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.\u000aThe November jobs report was likely to offer further clues as to when the Federal Reserve will start dialling back its stimulus.\u000aThe Nikkei ended down 2.2 per cent at 15,407.94, hitting its lowest closing level in two weeks. On Tuesday, the benchmark logged its highest close since December 2007.\u000aStill, the Nikkei is up 48 per cent so far this year, spurred by Japan's massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. If the gains were to hold for the rest of the year, it would be the Nikkei's best yearly performance since 1972.\u000aThe broader Topix index closed 1.7 per cent lower at 1,240.99 on Wednesday, with 2.54 billion shares changing hands, down from Tuesday's one-week high of 2.69 billion shares.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a

VFlorida:\u000aOnce the Federal Reserve finally trims its bond-buying program, it should then commit to an effective schedule that would wind it down completely, a top US central banker said on Thursday.\u000aAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart sounded more upbeat on the prospects for the US economy when he said in a speech it was reasonable for investors to expect the Fed's asset-purchase policy to be wound down over the coming year.\u000aThe Fed should consider taking the first step in reducing its $85-billion monthly bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, at a meeting this month and at the upcoming meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee given the overall positive economic activity of late, he said.\u000aThe comments put Lockhart - a centrist at the central bank who does not have a vote on monetary policy this year - in sync with at least two other top officials who want to better telegraph how the Fed's unprecedented support for the US economy will be withdrawn.\u000a"Once the decision is made, I favor providing the public as much clarity and certainty as possible about how the change will be executed," Lockhart told a Broward Workshop in the beachside city of Fort Lauderdale, near Miami.\u000aThe Fed, frustrated with the slow and halting pace of recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, has kept interest rates near zero for five years and has swelled its balance sheet to nearly $4 trillion to spur investment, hiring, and growth.\u000aA fresh reading on US gross domestic product growth on Thursday showed the economy grew at a strong 3.6 per cent in the third quarter, up from a previous reading of 2.8 per cent and the biggest jump since the beginning of last year.\u000aTalking to reporters, Lockhart downplayed the reading, saying "It doesn't make a trend and ... doesn't drive me to the conclusion that we've had a breakout in terms of growth."\u000aYet with unemployment having fallen to 7.3 per cent from a post-recession high of 10 per cent in 2009, financial markets are now on edge about when the Fed will reduce its 15-month-old quantitative easing program, known as QE3 because it is the third such round.\u000aForward guidance\u000aEarlier this year, when Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the Fed was starting to consider trimming QE, investors pushed up borrowing costs so fast that it threatened to undercut the still-fragile recovery. Startled Fed officials have since stressed that reducing QE does not mean they will raise rates sooner than necessary.\u000aLockhart said he was among those at the Fed's October policy meeting who, according to the minutes, wanted to "announce a total size of remaining purchases or a timetable for winding down the program" because a "calendar-based step-down" in the pace of QE would help markets better predict it.\u000a"It will be helpful to the transition process to provide as much certainty as possible about how this will be done," Lockhart said.\u000aUnlike the previous two rounds of QE, the Fed's third round of bond-buying is set up as "open-ended." Bernanke and other top officials have stressed the pace of purchases would be adjusted depending on economic data.\u000aBut San Francisco Fed President John Williams and then Charles Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed last month publicly embraced the idea of capping bond buys as a way to give investors clarity on the Fed's next steps and to shore up its credibility.\u000aLockhart's embrace suggests the idea may be gaining traction ahead of a much-anticipated December 17-18 Fed policy meeting.\u000aTurning to the question of when to reduce QE, Lockhart said it should be an option at that December meeting and at upcoming meetings "as long as the resulting overall posture of policy preserves a high degree of accommodation".\u000a"If market expectations are that the asset purchase program will wind down over the coming year, I think that is reasonable."\u000aMost economists think the Fed will hold off on a reduction to the bond-buying program until March, but some say December is not out of the question, especially if job creation picks up. The Fed has said it will keep buying bonds until there is substantial improvement in the labor market outlook. The government will release data on November jobs growth on Friday, following a better-than-expected increase in hiring in October.\u000aLockhart also said the Fed should discuss adjusting its so-called forward guidance on when rates will finally rise, though he said he hasn't made up his mind on what steps if any would be best.\u000aTurning back to the economy, the policymaker said there are reasons to be optimistic that all-important consumer spending will strengthen, adding he was "pretty confident" in the sustainability of the economy's progress.\u000aCopyright @ Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a

VOn Wednesday, Himani Kashyap was found dead inside the bathroom of their Ghaziabad house with gunshot injuries on her head. (File photo)\u000aBallia, Uttar Pradesh: \u000aHighlights\u000aBSP today said it will wait for the court verdict before deciding on any action against party lawmaker Narendra Kashyap in connection with his daughter-in-law's death.\u000a"Party will decide on taking action against MP Narendra Kashyap only after court verdict on the issue....", Bahujan Samaj Party state unit president Ram Achal Rajbhar, who was here to take part in a party programme, told reporters.\u000a"This a matter concerning law... what is right and what is wrong will be decided by the court... picture will be clear only after that," Mr Rajbhar said, although he added that party supremo Mayawati will decide what has to be done in the matter.\u000aTo a question, Mr Rajbhar ruled out any "pact" with Asaduddin Owaisi's party in the coming UP Assembly elections and said BSP will go alone on the basis of social engineering.\u000a"Fed up of Akhilesh Yadav government's jungle raj, the people of the state have decided to make Mayawati chief minister for the fifth time," Mr Rajbhar added.\u000aHimanshi Kashyap, the daughter of former BSP minister Hiralal Kashyap, was married to Narendra Kashyap's son Sagar three years ago and the couple have a one-year-old son.\u000aOn Wednesday, the 29-year-old was found dead inside the bathroom of their house in Sanjay Nagar of Ghaziabad with gunshot injuries on her head.\u000a

VThis week there is an excellent app bundle that will get you a big discount on productivity apps. There is also a lot for mobile gamers to look forward to in this week's list.\u000a\u000aNevolutionFrom the developer of Greenify comes Nevolution, for notifications on Android. Nevolution aims to make the current notification support in apps better through the community. Have you wanted to split up your WhatsApp notifications by conversation? Nevolution will help. You can even bundle notifications together. There's a lot to like here if you spend a bit of time tweaking it.\u000a\u000aThe Productivity PackBundles that discount various pieces of software and services are always great and the Productivity Pack includes some really great premium subscriptions at a massively discounted price, until April 22. A one year subscription is included for Pocket Premium, LastPass Premium, Wunderlist Pro, Quip, and more. You also get 12 weeks of New York Times digital access through the apps. The bundle can be bought for $69.99 (approximately Rs. 4,600) - an 85 percent discount.\u000a\u000aCheck it out here. The app subscriptions work on both iOS and Android.\u000a\u000aAncestry for AndroidAncestry is a great app to view historical documents and records on iOS and Android. The Android app just got a nice update that brings a new user interface with easier navigation. It also lets you quickly switch between family trees and add sources to images. It syncs with Ancestry.com accounts and can let you add members from Facebook as well.\u000a\u000aPKTBALLLaser Dog's first free to play game released on iOS a few days ago and it is one of the most fun casual games out there. PKTBALL is an iOS-only (it will probably release on Android too, just like their other games) fast paced arcade-y sports game that combines tennis, football, powerups, and more. The mechanics draw some inspiration from Crossy Road in how you acquire new characters and that's a good thing. PKTBALL is free to play and the freemium aspects are never in your face.\u000a\u000aVaingloryVainglory is the first MOBA developed keeping touch controls in mind. It features 3 vs 3 battles with stunning visuals. Also it runs at 60 frames per second and features superfast response times for controls. You need to destroy the enemy Vain crystal to succeed. Vainglory is free to play and features skins, proper lane battles, and more. It is more polished than most games you will play today.\u000a\u000aWayward SoulsThis brilliant mobile game takes inspiration from some of the best games to deliver a precise action adventure experience that is fairly ambitious in scope. The pixel art visual style has aged really well as we've seen with multiple releases and Wayward Souls comes packed with great controls, tons of content, regular updates, and best of all, no in app purchases. This game is a premium title, and the price goes up as more content is added, so buy now and get free updates.\u000a\u000aFilters for iOSFrom the creators of the widely used Camera+ comes Filters by Tap Tap Tap. It has more than 800 ways to adjust and improve your photographs. You can zoom in to edit, compare edits, add film grain, textures, and more. It has more than 500 filters as well for quick adjustment including pro film recreations. I expect this to get good updates just like Camera+.

VA 53-year-old former yakuza gangster shows off his silicone-made finger during a visit to prosthetics specialist Shintaro Hayashi's office in Tokyo.\u000aTokyo:  Japanese mobsters driving flash cars purchased with bank loans. Executives bowing in apology for loaning millions to those underworld figures. And high-level officials vowing to squash the crime syndicates, known as yakuza.\u000aJapan Inc. is engulfed in its worst mob scandal in years and it's shining a rare light on the links between big business and shadowy organised crime groups usually known for low-brow ventures like extortion and loan sharking.\u000aBut with membership falling as police ratchet up a crackdown, experts say the yakuza are branching far outside their traditional business into everything from insider trading to funding business startups.\u000a"Insider trading has become huge - you can make much more money manipulating stocks" than extorting businesses, says Jake Adelstein, a crime writer whose bestselling memoir "Tokyo Vice" is set to become a Hollywood movie.\u000aAdelstein, a former reporter at Japan's top-selling Yomiuri daily, likens the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's biggest organised crime group, to "Goldman Sachs with guns".\u000aTattoos and missing pinkies\u000aMany mobsters - forever associated with full-body tattoos and lopped-off pinky fingers - have now ditched that tough guy persona in favour of tailored suits and clean-cut look that could pass in any boardroom, Adelstein said.\u000a"They're savvy investors," he said added. "They like to gamble."\u000aThe yakuza occupy a grey area in Japan's usually law-abiding society.\u000aThey are both feared and loathed as social outcasts, while they're revered in equal measure through film, fanzines and manga cartoons.\u000aLike the Italian mafia or Chinese triads, the yakuza engage in activities ranging from gambling, drugs, and prostitution to loan sharking, protection rackets and other illegal ventures often run through front companies.\u000aBut unlike their foreign counterparts, yakuza are legal groups with offices in major Japanese cities, and they have historically been tolerated by authorities, although there are periodic clampdowns on some of their less savoury activities.\u000aIn fact, the Yamaguchi-gumi helped dole out food after a major quake in the western city of Kobe in 1995.\u000a'Sophisticated methods'\u000aBut Tokyo is now under intense pressure from abroad to clamp down on yakuza and their money laundering, as the US Treasury Department works to freeze the overseas assets of top Japanese crime groups which it says make "billions of dollars annually in illicit proceeds".\u000aThe crackdown at home has intensified after Mizuho Bank said in September that it had loaned money to organised crime members, an admission subsequently repeated by at least four other major lenders including Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.\u000aSometimes loans were legitimately used by gangsters to buy foreign sports cars or other expensive items, while in other cases the vehicle was quickly sold on the black market with the loan never paid back.\u000aThe scandal at Mizuho worsened after it initially said top executives knew nothing about the loans, only to backtrack on that claim as a company-commissioned report blasted its laissez-faire compliance.\u000aMizuho later said more than 50 executives would be punished with its chief executive foregoing pay for six months.\u000aBut the latest admissions are not a first for the country's banks, a big source of concern among police wary of sharing details of investigations with mob-linked firms, experts say.\u000a"It is baffling that Mizuho board members failed to act," said Toshihiko Kubo, professor of financial law at Ritsumeikan University.\u000a"Once they learned that loan recipients were related to the mob, they should have taken immediate action."\u000aMajor lenders are routinely approached by those with links to organised crime looking to raise money, said an anti-yakuza campaigner in Tokyo, echoing calls from Finance Minister Taro Aso, among others, to tighten banking rules.\u000a"Crime syndicates...are out to make money, and they'll use whatever means available," said the campaigner, who asked not to be identified.\u000a"Many companies are trying not to deal with organised crime...But It's difficult to filter everything because their methods are also becoming sophisticated."\u000aEarlier this year, the Japan Securities Dealers Association launched a database to help keep those with mob links out of the country's now-sizzling stock market.\u000aThe pressure on Tokyo to clean up the problem is set to intensify as Japan looks to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.\u000aOn paper, the police crackdown appears headed in the right direction with yakuza membership down by about 28 per cent to 63,000 in 2012 from a decade ago, according to police data.\u000aMob links run deep\u000aStill, yakuza links run deep in Japan and some credit their tough presence for keeping street crime low.\u000aTheir place is so deeply rooted that senior politicians are sometimes found to have mob ties, including ex-Justice Minister Keishu Tanaka who resigned last year following reports of his association with mobsters.\u000a"There are lots of politicians that, in some sense, owe their positions to yakuza support back in old days, so clearly their influence is not non-existent," Adelstein says.\u000a"It's still a bizarre system because Japan's organised crime groups are legal entities. They are regulated but not banned."\u000a

VArjun?s next Gunday releases on February 14.\u000aActor Arjun Kapoor says he wants to imbibe superstar Salman Khan's quality of remaining unaffected by success and failure.\u000aSalman has been instrumental in bringing Arjun in the film industry and the young actor is thankful to him. "A lot of things stem in me because of the way he conducts himself, the way he talks or approaches his work, and how he is not affected by success and failure. That is the biggest quality of Salman bhai that I appreciate. He has not changed for anybody - if he gives ten flops or hits he is still the same," Arjun told PTI.\u000aThe actor says the most important thing that he has learnt from his mentor is that regardless of what happens in his professional life, he would not like to change himself as a person for wrong reasons. \u000a "I don't want success to affect me to that extent that I change or failure to that extent that I get sad, bitter and negative. Salman bhai has maintained that and has retained his core qualities nicely. I would like to learn that and imbibe that in personal life," he said.\u000aArjun has moved on from the failure of his last film Aurangzeb. "We made a different film and showed the people that I could do something different... I am still very proud of the film. I have not sat and thought what went wrong as there is no point in dwelling about it," he said.\u000aArjun will be seen next in Gunday, which seems to be in into the space of masala entertainers. "Gunday is not a mindless commercial film. I think we as (young) actors cannot do such (masala films) kind of cinema. We have not created an audience for ourselves, they just go to see our films and not us. Audience has accepted us but they are still discovering us. The idea of Gunday is not to cater to single screen audience alone," he said.\u000aArjun is happy that people are liking the on-screen equation between him and co-star Ranveer Singh in the film. "Till now we are getting good response for our pairing. We hope they want to see more of us together. It is the media that decides we are like them (Jai-Veeru or Karan-Arjun)... We believe it's our chemistry and we did not try to replicate anyone," he said.\u000a"The unfortunate part is in the last few years there was no film made on intense friendship. So the first reference of Jai-Veeru or Karan-Arjun is made as these are the iconic characters that remind people of friendship and brotherhood. Hopefully, we will be able to create an identity for Bikram and Bala of Gunday," he said.\u000aArjun feels comparisons are inevitable and one has to be prepared for that. "Gunday reminds people of certain heroes and films of 70s-80s. It is a compliment as our film is compared to films of those times. I think our film will create its own identity. With Gunday, I hope Ranveer and I would also be able to create a different sort of an identity for ourselves."\u000aArjun is thankful to producer Aditya Chopra for having faith in him for the movie.\u000a"Aditya Chopra had faith in us that we were capable of pulling a film bigger than us. It is a very big film. We knew we had to be responsible and do a good job," he said. Usually, two contemporaries do not come together for a film as they feel it will eat into each other's work, but Arjun doesn't think that way.\u000a"I don't look at Ranveer as competition and even he doesn't think of me that way. I can't speak for other actors. I love ensemble and multi-starrer films. I don't consider anyone as competition as there is enough work for everyone. We both are not insecure about each other. It is a myopic way of looking at industry," he said.\u000aArjun thinks if he and Ranveer are able to pull a two-hero film like Gunday, may be it will give confidence to other actors to shed their concern of not doing films with other contemporaries.\u000a

VFile photo of Iraq's President Fouad Massoum. (Reuters)\u000aBAGHDAD:  Iraq's defence minister said on Sunday he had told his Turkish counterpart that hundreds of Turkish forces deployed inside Iraq near the Islamic State-held city of Mosul had been sent without informing or coordinating with Baghdad, and should be withdrawn.\u000aKhaled al-Obeidi said in a statement the Turkish defence minister had explained the deployment as necessary to protect Turkish military advisers training Iraqi forces in preparation for a campaign to retake Mosul.\u000aBut Obeidi said the Turkish force was too large for such a purpose.\u000a"No matter the size of the force entering Iraq, it is rejected," the statement said. "It was possible to undertake this sort of prior coordination without creating circumstances which contributed to a crisis between the two countries."\u000aIraq's president, prime minister and foreign ministry have all objected to the Turkish deployment in recent days, calling it a hostile act and a violation of international law. Baghdad also summoned the Turkish ambassador to issue a formal protest.\u000aTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Saturday it was a routine troop rotation and Turkish forces had set up a camp some 30 km (19 miles) northeast of Mosul at the Mosul governor's request, and in coordination with the Iraqi Defence Ministry.\u000aA small number of Turkish trainers were already at the camp before the latest deployment to train the Hashid Watani (national mobilisation), a force made up of mainly Sunni Arab former Iraqi police and volunteers from Mosul, which Islamic State militants seized in June 2014.\u000a

VNew Delhi:  US ambassador-designate Nancy J. Powell arrived in New Delhi on Thursday, following her March 29 confirmation by the American Senate as the first woman head of the US mission in India.\u000aPowell, who innovatively said 'hello' to India in 10 different Indian languages earlier this week, holds the highest rank in the US foreign service, with the title of career ambassador.\u000aTestifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 7, she had said India will be "a leading security partner of the United States in the 21st century".\u000a"Our relations are firmly grounded in a set of shared democratic values and an increasingly shared strategic vision of both the opportunities that can promote those values as well as the threats that can undermine them," she had said.\u000aPrior to US President Barack Obama nominating her as ambassador to India, Powell, 65, was director general of the foreign service and director of human resources.\u000aShe was the US ambassador to Nepal from August 2007 to August 2009. From 2006-2007, she served as the national intelligence officer for South Asia at the national intelligence council, as the state department's senior coordinator for avian influenza, and as acting assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement activities.\u000aPowell has also served as ambassador to Pakistan, Ghana, and Uganda.\u000aOther prior assignments also include serving as the deputy chief of mission in Bangladesh and Togo, acting assistant secretary for African affairs, principal deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, consul general in Kolkata, and minister counsellor for political affairs at US embassy in New Delhi.\u000aShe graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1970.\u000aFor that intimate message of greetings earlier this week, Powell had wielding a much-used camera, and is shown in the video walking around the National Mall in Washington DC as she speaks about her time in India from 1992 to 1995 when she served in Kolkata and in New Delhi.\u000a"I am impressed by how much deeper and broader Indian-American relations have become and how much greater role India now plays in addressing the world's challenges," she said outlining her ambitious built on a "rock solid foundation".\u000aThe 2.36-minute video, released by the US embassy in New Delhi ahead of Powell's arrival, is subtitled in 10 Indian languages: Hindi, Urdu, Bangla, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Punjabi and Gujarati.\u000aPowell said she plans to travel to all corners of India, and that she sees India and the US "forming one of the definitive partnerships of the 21st century". She is also looking forward to walks in Lodhi Gardens in central Delhi, she said.\u000aBut "I am not focused on reliving the past", she says, and speaks of capturing a "future of even stronger ties between US and India".\u000a"Phir milenge," ("Till we meet again,") she concludes, just before flying down to New Delhi.\u000a

VNew Delhi: Indian Oil Corporation, the country's largest oil firm, plans to invest Rs. 18,000 crore to raise capacity of its Panipat refinery in Haryana to 25 million tonnes (MT) by 2020, larger than previously planned.\u000aIOC had previously planned to raise capacity of Panipat refinery from 15 MT to 20.2 MT, but now it is looking at raising the capacity straightway to 25 MT, its director (refineries) Sanjiv Singh said here.\u000a"We have land at Panipat refinery site and so we are looking at going straight to 25 million tonnes," he said. "We have to look at the capacity of the pipeline, which carries crude oil from west coast to the refinery before finalising if the capacity should be expanded to 20.2 million tonnes as planned earlier or go straight to 25 million tonnes."\u000aIOC owns and operates 11 out of India's 23 refineries with a combined refining capacity of 80.7 million tonnes per annum (MTPA).\u000aMr Singh said the company board will shortly take up investment approval for the Panipat expansion as well as that of capacity upgrade at Koyali refinery in Gujarat and Mathura unit in Uttar Pradesh.\u000aIt is looking to scale up its Koyali refinery capacity to 18 MT from 13.7 MT currently while a 3-MTPA capacity addition is planned at Mathura. "We have land at both Koyali and Mathura, so the expansion would not be a problem," he said.\u000aIndian Oil's board had only last week approved investment of over Rs. 9,800 crore in expansion of its Barauni refinery in Bihar and setting up a petrochemical unit at the Panipat refinery complex.\u000aThe board, in its meeting on Thursday, approved expansion of the Barauni refinery to 9 MTPA from 6 MTPA. The expansion along with downstream polypropylene unit will cost Rs. 8,287 crore, Mr Singh said.\u000a"We have three small crude distillation units at Barauni currently. We plan to pull them down and build new crude processing units. The options before us are to set up one big unit of 9 MT or two units of 6 MT and 3 MT," he said.\u000aThe Barauni expansion will be completed by 2021-22.\u000aThe expansion would meet rising demand in eastern India, particularly in Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh, he said.\u000aAlso, the board accorded "in-principle" approval for implementation of Olefin recovery project along with expansion of existing naphtha cracker unit, MEG (monoethylene glycol) revamp and benzene expansion unit modifications at Panipat at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,527 crore", he said.\u000aThe Panipat refinery was commissioned in 1998 with a capacity of 6 MTPA. The refining capacity was doubled to 12 MTPA in 2006 and then raised to 15 MTPA in 2010.\u000aOnce expanded, this will cater to fuel needs of north and western India. "We are working on raising fuel quality specifications to meet Euro-VI standards at our refineries and so, the Panipat expansion too is being reconfigured to meet the new specifications," he said.\u000a

VWashington:  Washington's top tax official was fired on Wednesday as President Barack Obama sought to stem a rising tide of criticism in a scandal over the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups for special scrutiny.\u000aSeeking to regain the initiative amid a series of controversies that have threatened his second-term agenda, Obama said new leadership was needed to restore public confidence in the IRS, whose reputation for political independence has suffered a major blow.\u000aWith congressional investigations looming, Obama said he had told Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to seek the resignation of Steven Miller, the acting IRS commissioner, and Lew had done so.\u000a"I'll do everything in my power to make sure nothing like this happens again by holding the responsible parties accountable, by putting in place new checks and new safeguards," Obama told reporters in the White House's ornate East Room.\u000aThe IRS revelations have added to a sense of a White House under siege and a president struggling to gain control of fast-moving events.\u000aRepublicans continue to bash the administration's handling of the attack last year on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. And on Monday, the Justice Department came under fire for seizing phone records of journalists from the Associated Press as part of a criminal probe into intelligence leaks.\u000aObama spoke after meeting with senior Treasury officials on ways to quell the growing uproar after a government watchdog described how poor management led to an "inappropriate" focus on claims by conservative groups for tax-exempt status.\u000aThe Democratic president, who had been accused by Republican critics of reacting too passively to the scandal, called the misconduct "inexcusable."\u000a"Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it," he said. "I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives."\u000aHe promised to work "hand in hand" with Congress to fix the problem but, acknowledging the realities of a divided Washington, urged lawmakers to deal with the delicate issue in a way that does not "smack of politics or partisan agendas."\u000aObama's announcement followed stepped-up calls from Republican lawmakers for Miller, who was aware in 2012 of the agency's efforts to single out conservative groups as a deputy IRS commissioner, and other top IRS officials to step down.\u000aRepublicans made clear they intended to keep up the pressure on the Obama administration.\u000a"More than two years after the problem began, and a year after the IRS told us there was no problem, the president is beginning to take action," Senate Republican Minority leader Mitch McConnell said.\u000a"If the president is as concerned about this issue as he claims, he'll work openly and transparently with Congress to get to the bottom of the scandal - no stonewalling, no half-answers, no withholding of witnesses," he said.\u000a Miller voices 'regret' for departure\u000aMiller said in a message to colleagues that there was a "strong and immediate need" to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency.\u000a"It is with regret that I will be departing from the IRS as my acting assignment ends in early June," Miller wrote. "This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days."\u000aEarlier on Wednesday, CNN quoted a congressional source as saying Miller had said the IRS had pinpointed two "rogue" employees in the agency's Cincinnati, Ohio, office as being principally responsible for "overly aggressive" reviews of requests for tax-exempt status by groups associated with the conservative Tea Party movement.\u000aThe Justice Department has launched a criminal probe of the IRS, and on Wednesday a third congressional committee announced that it would begin its own investigation.\u000aDemocrats have also voiced outrage over the IRS's actions but have mostly avoided chastising the administration.\u000aEarlier, on Capitol Hill, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner offered harsh criticism of the IRS. "My question isn't about who is going to have to resign. My question is who is going to jail over this scandal," he said.\u000aAll 45 Republican members of the US Senate sent Obama a letter demanding that his Democratic administration fully comply with congressional requests for information in the scandal.\u000a"The American people deserve to know what actions will be taken to ensure those who made these policy decisions at the IRS are being held fully accountable and more importantly what is being done to ensure that this kind of raw partisanship is fully eliminated from these critically important non-partisan government functions," the senators wrote.\u000aThe audit issued on Tuesday by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) described a series of problems within the IRS that led the agency to use "inappropriate criteria" for evaluating tax-exempt groups, in part by singling out scores of conservative Tea Party and "Patriot" organizations for increased scrutiny.\u000aBut the audit did not find evidence the IRS actions were motivated by partisan interests - a conclusion some Republicans do not accept. The notion of a federal agency targeting conservatives based on ideology feeds into a Republican narrative of growing government intrusion under Obama.\u000aDespite efforts by some conservative commentators to cast the IRS troubles as something akin to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, or to former President Richard Nixon's use of the IRS to target his political enemies, there has been no sign of White House involvement.\u000aFor the IRS and the administration, however, the stakes are particularly high because the agency is playing an increasingly significant role not only in vetting the tax status of non-profit groups that dabble in politics but also in enforcing parts of Obama's ongoing overhaul of the healthcare system.\u000a

VIndia's youngest state, Telangana, to be born on June 2, will vote overwhelmingly in favour of K Chandrasekhara Rao, the man who fronted the movement for the region to be carved out of Andhra Pradesh as a separate state. (Full Coverage: NDTV Exit Polls)\u000aAccording to NDTV's exit poll, KCR, as he is known, will get 11 of the 17 parliamentary seats at stake. His party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi or TRS, has refused to ally so far with the Congress, which is forecast to get just three seats.\u000aThe Congress at the centre pushed the proposal for a Telangana state through parliament, counting on the move to serve as a vote-getter, but the initiative saw major blowback from its own leaders in Andhra Pradesh with Kiran Kumar Reddy resigning as chief minister. A botched roll-out -the Congress could not get the proposal cleared by parliament in time to ensure the new state was formed before elections were held - appears to have alienated voters. In 2009, the party won 12 seats in the region; this time, it loses nine of them.\u000aChandrababu Naidu, chief of the Telugu Desam Party or TDP, did not openly endorse a Telangana state but will manage two seats here.\u000aThe decision to turn Telangana into a state is also costing the Congress heavily in Seemandhra, the regions that will form the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh. NDTV's exit poll shows the party not getting a single seat there.\u000a

VBJP lawmaker Sakshi Maharaj said Nathuram Godse is a patriot. However, he later retracted.\u000aNew Delhi:  A lawmaker Sakshi Maharaj, today embarrassed his party the ruling BJP by describing Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as a "patriot."\u000aAmid outrage at his comment, he soon retracted, saying, "I don't consider Godse a patriotic person. I take back my words if I said something by mistake. I didn't say that Godse was a patriotic person."\u000aHe had earlier said, "I feel Nathuram Godse was a patriot just as Mahatma Gandhi was."\u000aThe opposition Congress demanded that a case of treason be filed against Sakshi Maharaj. Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Tushar Gandhi said, "Sakshi Maharaj is at least honest enough to come out and say what's in his heart... The government should endorse what Sakshi Maharaj has said, they shouldn't be double faced."\u000aThe government sought to distance itself from the new controversy, which was brought up in Parliament by Congress lawmaker Husain Dalwai who alleged that Godse was honoured at a function in Maharashtra recently. "It is absolutely wrong and the government should arrest them. Why is the government silent on the issue?" he asked.\u000aCongress members protested loudly alleging that the function was organised among others, by the Bajrang Dal, an organisation affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor.\u000aParliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu emphasised in the Rajya Sabha that, "There is no question of honouring such people. There is no question of the government doing it."\u000aHe also said, "We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable."\u000aNathuram Godse, a right-wing activist, had shot the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi thrice in the chest at point blank range on January 30, 1948. He was hanged in November 1949.\u000a

VThe future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed, says science fiction author William Gibson. It's especially true for the state of broadband in the country. Content delivery network Akamai notes in its Q3 2015 State of the Internet report that India, at 2.5mbps, had the lowest average connection speed among ten Asia Pacific countries surveyed in the region. The global leader, South Korea, has an average connection speed of 20.5mbps.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for the fastest speeds in India, try heading to Kochi-based incubator Startup Village, the first in the country to get Gigabit (1000mbps) speeds in late 2012. India's public universities are also providing phenomenally fast speeds, judging by Speedtest screenshots on a Quora thread. We also looked at various telecom forums, Reddit discussion groups, and of course, searched for connections and prices on our own as well, to try and catch all the major providers who are claim to be delivering high speed connections. Do note that we have not verified these speeds first hand.\u000a\u000aFor the purposes of this roundup, we've tried to identify wired broadband ISPs in the country that that are offering download speeds of 50mbps speeds or higher to consumers. Well-known ISPs such as Tikona, Airnetwork, or Mach1 broadband, Alliance Broadband, or Excell Broadband (and many more) that offer a top speed under 50mbps didn't make the cut.\u000a\u000aWith a growing number of ISPs offering 50mbps at affordable prices, it seems to be a good cutoff point, available at monthly billing plans between Rs. 1,500 - Rs. 2,000, including taxes. Note that ISPs calculate speed in bits - so a 50mbps speed translates to downloads of 6.25MBps or megabytes per second speeds, which should be ample enough for a family to make video calls, stream movies or music, and download that Windows update simultaneously.\u000a\u000a1) HayaiIncorporated in 2011, Hayai Broadband Private Limited has the most consumer friendly prices and speeds, with monthly plans ranging from Rs. 899, pre-service taxes for a 100mbps connection with a 50GB data cap. The company offers 1Gbps speeds with a FUP (Fair Usage Policy) cap of 500GB for Rs. 5,099. The company also an arcane 95 percentile billing plan, along with all you can eat plans, but based on views of users on broadband forums in the country, it has been slow to expand, and there is a substantial waiting list for its service in Mumbai. The company has shared a list of cities it plans to expand to in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.\u000a\u000a2) HathwayHathway provides broadband services in over 13 cities, but not all of them support 50mbps speeds, which are presently available in the nine cities listed below. Plans range from Rs. 2,099 for a three month plan at speeds of 50mbps with a 20GB monthly FUP data cap. Hathway's 'Adv Fiber HD 125 plan' offers 5mbps speeds with a 125GB data limit at a competitive three month subscription price of Rs. 3,749.\u000a\u000a3) ACT FibernetFocused primarily in South India, ACT (Atria Convergence Technologies Pvt Ltd.) is the largest non-telco ISP in India. The company provides fibernet, digital TV and HD TV services, with affordable monthly tariffs under Rs. 2,000 for 50-100mbps speeds in Bengaluru. Its Fair Usage Policy (FUP) applies only on downloads, while uploads are not counted in FUP, according to the FAQs. As ACT Fibernet uses fiber-to-the-home technology, it doesn't require any modem or a land-line phone, and can be plugged straight into a PC with an Ethernet port, following which one needs to log into their Web portal with their account ID and password. This can be a bit of a pain point, but ACT Fibernet lists five reasons why it has decided to go with such a configuration.\u000a\u000a4) YOU BroadbandYOU Broadband offers cable modem broadband services to residential, SME and corporate customers in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Telengana, and Andhra Pradesh. The 'YOU WTF 100' plan offers a 100mbps plan for 200GB per month at Rs. 1,732 in Bengaluru. However, while personal user accounts may vary, Reddit users seem to prefer Act Fibernet over YOU Broadband in terms of consistency of speed, up time, and user support.\u000a\u000a5) Den BoombandPrimarily focused on North India, Den Boomband offers 50mbps plans starting at Rs. 1,200, with a 30GB FUP data cap. The 100mbps plans are priced at Rs. 3,500, with a 100GB data cap. The website has a map-based search to find out if it's available in your locality, and uses a vote-based system to map out its expansion plans. Many users have complained about outages and slow speeds though, and Den has a 1.5 star rating on Facebook.\u000a\u000a6) SpectranetHeadquartered in New Delhi, Spectranet says it provides truly unlimited broadband, with no caps on data consumed. Its 'Success Unlimited' plan provides 50mbps speeds at Rs. 5,547. Spectranet is currently running a three-month trial offer with 100mbps broadband speed in Gurgaon at Rs 1,199 per month with no download limit, and said that it will be rolling out this offer in other cities this year.\u000a\u000a7) AsianetOperational in a total of 14 districts in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Asianet offers FTTH/DOCSIS 3 connections with plans for 50mbps speeds starting at an affordable Rs. 549, but with a 7GB usage limit. It has over five other plans at 50mbps, with the 'Xtream 2499', offering a 160GB usage limit at a monthly subscription price of Rs. 2,499. The ISP is notable for providing a FUP breaker, which is higher than the monthly usage limit, following which it charges users 20 paise per MB.\u000a\u000a8) Jetspot FiberFounded in 2015, Jetspot offers FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) plans starting from 5mbps at Rs. 699 per month with a 10GB data cap,to 60mbps speeds at Rs. 9,999 per month. For the Rs. 9,999 plan, speeds are dialed down to 10mbps after using 150GB. The company is presently running a promotional plan called the 'Fiber Nitro', for Rs. 999, which offers speeds of upto 100mbps uptil 10GB, and 1mbps unlimited speeds post the data cap.\u000a\u000a9) AirtelTelecom operator Airtel is offering FTTH plans in select buildings in Delhi NCR region, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. You will have to contact your local Airtel agent to find out if FTTH services are available in your area - ask for the availability of Airtel's Bolt plans, which offer 100mbps with a monthly data cap of 100 GB starting Rs. 2,399.\u000a\u000aOthersApart from these providers, we found some more connections but didn't see as much discussion around these. BSNL, the state owned telecom provider offers fibre to the home services in 18 circles, but has rather exorbitant prices for 50mbps plans, at Rs. 9,999 per month. MTNL also offers FTTH services in Delhi at a monthly service charge of Rs. 2,990, and Mumbai at Rs. 4,999.\u000a\u000aTata Docomo had launched its FTTH services in July 2013, starting with Bengaluru. However, it is not very clear where else it is offering its services, as its website doesn't seem to clearly mention any details on cities where it is available, and customer care is clueless as well. Tata Docomo offers a 50mbps plan starting at Rs. 1,999, which comes with a 20GB data cap.\u000a\u000aOperational in Punjab, Connectzone offers FTTH speeds with monthly plans starting at Rs. 849 for 5mbps, to Rs. 4,999 for 100mbps, which comes with a monthly data cap of 100GB. Gurgaon-based Nextra Teleservices has a FiberBolt 50 plan starting at Rs. 1,999, with a 30 GB download limit. Other players include Powernet, which offers 50mbps plans at Rs. 3,000 in Dwarka, Delhi.\u000a\u000aIn the West, We Internet, a Mumbai-based ISP has broadband plans upto 100mbps, as does SmartLink Broadband, operational in Powai and nearby areas. In the South, some ISPs to offer 50mbps speeds or higher speeds include Bengaluru-based ISP Namo Networks, and TTN Network, Chennai-based Cherrinet offers 100mbps speeds at Rs. 1,499, with a 125 GB data cap, while OoDoO offers 50mbps plans at Rs. 1,599 per month.

VAthletics' governing body has voted overwhelmingly to suspend Russia from the sport for widespread, state-sponsored doping and the ban will include the 2016 Olympics unless the country can demonstrate a major change in their approach and controls.\u000aAfter a three-hour teleconference on Friday, hosted by its president Sebastian Coe, the International Association of Athletics Federations' (IAAF) council voted 22-1 in favour of the sanction, with the Russian representative not able to vote.\u000aThe meeting was called to discuss Monday's report by the independent commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which recommended the punishment -- unprecedented for doping offences.\u000aThe report alleged \u2018systemic\u2019 collusion between Russian athletes and both the country's federation and anti-doping authorities and a "deeply-rooted culture of cheating" that enabled athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs without fear of being tested.\u000aThe report recommended suspending the Russian federation until a "new framework" was in place.\u000a"We will get the change we want and only then will Russian athletes return to international competition," Coe told reporters after Friday's call.\u000a"This is not about politics, this is about the protection of clean athletes. I cannot overstate the feeling around the conference call this evening about sending the strongest possible message that we can.\u000a"This has been a shameful wake-up call and we are clear that cheating at any level will not be tolerated.\u000a"But we discussed and agreed that the whole system has failed the athletes, not just in Russia, but around the world."\u000aRequired changes\u000aAsked if Russia would be able to make the required changes in time to return for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics next August, Coe said: "It is entirely up to the Russian federation. Our verification team will be tough and will want to make sure that before there is a re-introduction to the sport for their athletes and the federation those changes have taken place."\u000aRussia will be stripped of hosting the world race walking and world junior championships next year while the first competition to be affected by the ban is the European cross-country championships in France on Dec. 13.\u000aThe main athletics events in 2016 are the world Indoor Championships, the European athletics championships and the Olympics.\u000aRussia are one of the superpowers of the sport and finished second behind the United States in the track and field medal count at the 2012 Olympics in London.\u000a"To regain membership to the IAAF the new federation would have to fulfil a list of criteria," Coe said.\u000a"An inspection team will be led by Independent Chair Rune Andersen, an independent international anti-doping expert (Norwegian) and three members of the IAAF Council who will be appointed in the next few days."\u000aStephanie Hightower, president of US Track and Field and an IAAF council member, said of the "extraordinary" decision: "In light of the evidence, suspension was the only proper course of action... This sends a clear message to clean athletes that protecting them and protecting the sport, with a culture of accountability, is our top priority.\u000a"Although this is a difficult time, in the long term, the sport ultimately will be stronger for it."\u000aSuspended members\u000aThe IAAF has previously suspended members, including South Africa during its Apartheid regime, Afghanistan, Vanuatu, Algeria and Gabon, but none of those were drugs-related.\u000aCoe's predecessor as president, Lamine Diack, is being investigated by French police over allegations he received bribes to cover up positive doping tests of Russian athletes but Friday's meeting did not discuss that issue.\u000aOther aspects of the IAAF's actions regarding Russia were withheld from the commission's report on Monday as they form part of an investigation by Interpol into international corruption involving officials and athletes.\u000aCoe accepted, though, that the IAAF was also in the dock.\u000a"The IAAF, WADA, the member federations and athletes need to look closely at ourselves, our cultures and our processes to identify where failures exist and be tough in our determination to fix them and rebuild trust in our sport," he said.\u000a"We find ourselves in a shameful position tonight and we need to look at ourselves.\u000a"We have also addressed the failings of our own organisation and we have discussed strong, strong changes there," added Coe, who said he had asked Paul Deighton, the former CEO of the London 2012 Olympics, to oversee a programme of changes within the governing body.\u000a"The architecture of anti-doping has failed athletes worldwide," Coe added.\u000a Source: \u000a

VIn these days of information overload, buying a chicken is a bit like buying a cappuccino. You're bombarded by queries.\u000aAny flavor? Do you want corn fed chicken?\u000aAny toppings? Certified organic or regular?\u000aHere's my understanding of the difference between the various claims that cluck around the chicken label.\u000aA bit of the background\u000aWith growing demand for meat products over the last few decades, it was but natural for meat production to become an industrialized process, which produced standardized products.\u000aFor these industries, the economics of livestock works like this - the longer you have to keep an animal alive till it reaches its slaughter weight, the higher are your costs. To get more profits, the industrial giants have started to shorten the lifespan of the animal and fatten them quicker. To do this, the animal is confined to smaller areas, given growth hormones and fed a certain diet. It has led to crowding, confinement and selective breeding and so today livestock lives a much shorter life and under much harsher conditions than before.\u000aThis is probably why a large number of people who feel a moral responsibility towards livestock being treated badly, have come out and demanded that manufacturers put animal welfare conditions on the label. Today you can pick your meat that's been reared under better conditions. But you could get confused about the many labels out there.\u000aHere's a quick lowdown.\u000aFree Range Chicken\u000a It means that the bird is not confined to cages and sheds. They have access to outdoors. Which doesn't necessarily mean that the bird has roamed across fields and grassy lands. For all you know the poor creature was given a small fenced up area to roam in.\u000aHaving said that, to ensure that the birds have adequate space, producers will have to keep fewer birds in the same area and therefore to maintain profits, they are priced at a higher rate. These are considered nutritionally superior to regular chickens.\u000aPasteur Raised\u000a Pasteur raised means that the chicken has been put out on grass for most of their lives. The result is that the chicken lives longer (that's a moot point) and looks healthier.\u000aRaised without Antibiotics\u000aAs the name suggests, the chicken was raised without the usage of any antibiotics either to prevent or cure a disease. The reason that WHO has demanded an end to antibiotics in animal feed is that it can be linked to human bacterial infections. I'm fascinated to read that there are farmers in USA who have used oregano oil as a substitute for antibiotics and it's worked.\u000aCorn-fed Chickens\u000a Corn-fed chickens are raised on a diet of high-corn. This gives the chicken's flesh a butter-like color and, some consider, makes it more tender and tasty.\u000aNatural\u000a It means that the chicken wasn't artificially flavored and no preservatives or chemicals were introduced after the poultry was processed. It has nothing to do with how the chicken was reared. This includes not adding water or broth to add to the weight of the chicken and increase its sodium content.\u000aCertified Organic\u000a Certified organic simply means that no chemical fertilizers, pesticides and animal products were used. According to USDA, it means that the chicken was allowed access to outdoors.\u000aSo if you care about what your chicken has been up to while it was alive, and whether it was allowed to lead a normal bucolic life under the sun, you might want to take a closer look at these labels.\u000a

VA judge in Spain opened an investigation into whether Google\u005cu00A0 unlawfully collected data from unsecured wireless networks while gathering photographs for Google's photo-mapping service Street View.\u000a\u000aThe judge, Raquel Fernandino, has ordered a representative from Google to appear before her in early October over a lawsuit filed by a Spanish association of Internet users. The summons was issued last month, but made public only this week.\u000a\u000aStreet View has also caused regulatory and legal problems for Google in other European countries with strict privacy laws, including Germany and Switzerland, where opponents of the Street View photo archive have been particularly outspoken. In May, a judge in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation of Google over its collection of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in Germany.\u000a\u000aGoogle has described the collection of the data as accidental and has apologized for what it called a programming error.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for Google Spain, Marisa Toro, said on Tuesday that the company planned to cooperate fully with the judge and other Spanish authorities to resolve the privacy concerns. "We are dedicating a lot of our time to finding a solution so that users can be at ease," Ms. Toro said.\u000a\u000aGoogle introduced Street View in Spain three years ago, and Ms. Toro said that it had proved "very popular." Plans to expand the coverage in Spain have been delayed pending an outcome in the data collection dispute.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish association of Internet users, whose acronym is Apedanica, contends that Google violated an article in Spain's criminal code that forbids the unauthorized interception and collection of such communications data. Breaching that law can lead to prison sentences of up to four years.\u000a\u000aThe judge's investigation is the most serious threat to date in Spain for Google and its mapping service. But Street View had already raised concerns among local regulators.\u000a\u000aIn June, Artemi Rallo, director of the official Spanish data protection agency, Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, said in an interview that Google should hand over the original hard drives containing the actual Wi-Fi payload data -- including e-mail text fragments and unencrypted passwords.\u000a\u000aUnder pressure from German privacy regulators, Google acknowledged in May that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world as it assembled its Street View archive.\u000a\u000aThe company has already agreed to destroy the data collected in Ireland, Denmark and Austria at the request of officials in those countries.\u000a\u000aValentín Playá, the lawyer representing the Spanish association that filed the complaint against Google, said on Tuesday that "recognizing the mistake and the excuses presented by Google are not reasons to prevent the investigation, nor a criminal condemnation, if it is judged that the actions amounted to a crime and that there has been a degree of responsibility from Google."

VNew Delhi, June 10: Short poems written by Rabindranath Tagore which didn\u2019t come in public domain is being published for the first time in the form of a book.\u000aThe book \u2018Knockings at my heart\u2019 has around 81 such autograph-poems which will soon be released by Roli Books.\u000a\u201cThese are very short poems or couplets. He was influenced by the precision, depth, power and intensity of Japanese haiku style of poetry\u201d, said curator and poet Nilanjan Banerjee.\u000aThe book says Tagore soon perfected the craft and took it seriously which is evident in the painstaking modification of many of these poems years after they had been written. The polymath had composed numerous such short poems during his visits to China and Japan between 1916 and 1929.\u000aDuring the lifetime of the poet, three books of his short poems were published \u2013 \u2018Stray Birds\u2019 (1916), \u2018Lekhan\u2019 (1926) and \u2018Fireflies\u2019 (1928).\u000aTagore\u2019s writings in English were largely composed during his foreign travels or while corresponding with friends around the world.\u000aVery few of his poems were written originally in English like the well-known \u2018The Child\u2019 in 1931, which he translated into Bengali as \u2018Sisu Tirtha\u2019.\u000a

VMumbai:  While CCTVs in housing societies often prove a deterrent against theft and other crimes, certain criminal minds work their way around getting detected by the ever-vigilant eyes.\u000aA domestic help working at the residence of Marathi actress Kranti Redkar of 'Kombdi Palali' fame from the movie 'Jatra' was arrested on Saturday for stealing R 1.3 lakh and jewellery worth R 4.5 lakh from the actresses' 15th floor flat at Galaxy Height in Goregaon (W).\u000aPolice have recovered R 40,000 of the stolen cash, and all the jewellery, which the maid wrapped in a towel and threw out the bathroom window to avoid being caught on CCTV cameras. The booty was found intact in the building premises, as the maid, after the theft, couldn't collect it due to a locked gate.\u000aDuring police interrogation, Vandana Roge (20), who has been working at the Redkar residence since four years, confessed that she had planned the theft after Redkar's parents' had scolded her for bringing her boyfriend to the residence on October 5 when Redkar was out of town on work.\u000aAccording to police, the boyfriend was offended with the shouting and asked Roge to leave the job immediately. Cops said, Roge left the job, but returned after two days. She again left the house on October 28, claiming that her mother was ill, and that she needed to be with her. She returned on November 5 and then left on November 6. It was on November 6 that the actress realised that her jewellery and cash was missing.\u000a"She would keep going on short holidays and would steal some knick-knack from the house. She would confess about the same and would say that she did it for her boyfriend or ailing mother. She would also steal small amounts of cash, but we never thought she would carry out such a big theft. Initially, we never doubted her, but when she didn't turn up after November 6, our suspicions were aroused," said Redkar.\u000aSenior police inspector Arun Jadhav of Goregaon police said, "She was the first suspect, as she couldn't be traced since the day of robbery."\u000aRedkar's elder sister, who is doctor at a hospital, was instrumental in providing the breakthrough for the cops. Roge's mother had been admitted at her hospital once, and informed the cops about the same. "We got her residential address from the hospital directory, and traced her to Sanpada."\u000aDuring questioning, the maid told cops that she didn't want to take the jewellery along with her due to fear of being caught on closed-circuit television cameras at the building. Hence, she threw the jewellery from the bathroom window, and intended to take it after leaving the flat.\u000aBut when she reached the building compound, she found that the jewellery landed at a place that had a locked gate and the keys were with the watchman. She then left without taking the jewellery. Cops have ruled out the involvement of her boyfriend in the crime.\u000aWhen plans go awry:\u000a 1. The maid steals cash and jewellery from the cupboard\u000a 2. She then wraps the ornaments in a towel and flings it out from the toilet window\u000a 3. When she reaches the place where the booty landed, she realises the enclosure is inaccessible, as it is locked. She abandons the loot.\u000a

VZika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.\u000aGENEVA:  Widespread spraying to eliminate mosquitoes has failed to significantly stop the spread of dengue fever and it may be the same case for the Zika virus linked to neurological disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.\u000aThe emphasis should be put on enlisting families and communities to protect themselves and eliminate from their homes the mosquitoes that carry the disease, which has spread rapidly in Brazil and Latin America, it said.\u000aReleasing genetically modified mosquitoes or irradiating insects also needed to be studied, but evaluation of such novel methods should be done with "extreme rigour", the WHO warned.\u000aA three-day meeting of experts set two other top priorities for research: speeding development of tools to diagnose Zika infections and of vaccines to prevent the disease. But they said vaccine trials may come too late for the current outbreak.\u000aWHO Assistant Director General Marie-Paule Kieny said experts had told the meeting that there was no evidence that traditional mosquito control methods had had any significant impact on transmission of dengue, a virus close to Zika.\u000a"This is important because we must be sure that we invest in interventions that work," Kieny told a news briefing.\u000a"Certainly it is worth continuing to try to use this method for the lack of other interventions."\u000aShe said the Aedes aegyptii species of mosquito that carries Zika is the "cockroach of mosquitoes" because it stays mainly indoors and is hard to eradicate. Efforts to control it needed to be much more targeted to communities and households.\u000a"Then we will see whether it works or not," she said.\u000aOn Tuesday, the WHO advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with outbreaks of Zika virus due to the potential risk of birth defects, a condition known as microcephaly.\u000aZika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.\u000aThe most advanced candidate vaccines for Zika are still a few months away from entering early human clinical trials, Kieny said.\u000a"It is therefore possible that vaccines may come late for the current Latin American outbreak, but the development of a vaccine remains an imperative, in particular vaccines suitable for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age," she said.\u000a

VOn 5th June 2013, union cabinet finally approved the Real Estate Regulatory Bill. Clearance of this bill now brings a transparency in the real estate sector. However, the bill applies only to residential projects and commercial real estate property is not considered under this regulation. Now, there are many guidelines to be followed by builders or developers while constructing, launching and promoting new residential projects, which indicate more power in buyer's hand. Here, in this article we will analyse pros and cons of this bill:\u000aPros of Real Estate Regulatory Bill\u000a1. Well-timed delivery of flats to buyers\u000a There is common practice by builders of giving false promises to deliver flat keys within one to two years after registering in under construction project. However, they are not able to deliver flats to buyers as per decided time-line. Now, under real estate regulatory bill, strict regulations will be imposed on the builders or developers of the project to ensure that construction is running on schedule and flats are delivered on time to the buyer. In case there is a long delay in delivery of flats to buyers, then builder will be entitled to a full refund with interest.\u000a2. Giving accurate project details in disclosure\u000a In past, there were instances in which developers have promoted building projects with attractive amenities and infrastructure in new projects at under construction stage, but later on buyers discovered that many things discussed on website or promotion, brochures or layout is missing in actual constructed building. Now, with this bill developers need to share project plans in disclosure which will definitely be delivered with a flat. There can't be any change at a later stage of development by builder. In case builder is found guilty, then he will be penalized at 10 per cent of project costs or jail up to three years.\u000a3. Specifying actual carpet area becomes mandatory\u000a Developers are selling flats on the basis of super built area which includes common passage area, stairs and other areas which is 20-30 per cent more than actual flat area. Buyer is not well-informed about actual area of flat which is known as carpet area. Now, with this bill it's mandatory for builders to declare the actual carpet area of a flat in promotion activities.\u000a4. All clearances are compulsory before launching a project\u000a Most builders offer flats at huge discounts with pre-launch offer to attract buyers. However, buyers are not informed about all clearances in the project and risk of delay in delivery due to issue of important clearances from government. In this case, builders initially start working on project after getting some clearances and start selling flats but such projects get delayed or stuck at later stages due to some hurdles in getting complete clearance. The bill clearly state that the developers have to get all important clearances before they start selling flats.\u000a5. Maintain separate bank accounts for each project \u000a It's a common practice among developers to raise funds from buyers in the pre-launch offer and then utilizing the fund for buying land for other projects or engagements, but not using it in current project. Now, with this bill it's mandatory to maintain separate bank accounts for each project and transactions need to be maintained. Diversion of funds from one project to another will not be permitted. Developers or builders have to put aside 70 per cent of the proceeds of a particular project in a separate bank account which will help to fund the project and leads to complete it on schedule time.\u000a6. After sales service due to structural defects\u000a In case there is structural defect or deficiency in the development of building, then this bill allows approaching builder for after sales service. According to the bill, buyer needs to inform about the deficiencies within one year of purchase date. So, developer will be liable to rectify these defects without further charges.\u000aCons of Real Estate Regulatory Bill\u000a1. Past real estate projects excluded from the bill\u000a Real estate regulatory bill is applicable only to new real estate projects. So, most projects which were sold in last 2 to 3 years and are stuck in the process due to clearance or financial crunch are not included in the bill. There are many buyers which fail to get benefit of this bill due to exclusion of past real estate projects.\u000a2. Delay due to approval from government agencies\u000a Lot has been discussed about timely delivery of projects from builders or will be penalized. But there is lack of clarity on delays due to approval from government on clearance. Government bodies should follow strict time frames to clear the approvals of project. So, developer can launch these new projects smoothly and deliver it on schedule time.\u000a3. No mandatory regulation for projects less than 4000 square meter\u000a Registration with the regulator won't be mandatory for projects less than 4000 square meter. So, many small developers across metros like Mumbai, Bangalore, etc. will escape from registration and government regulator's control. In these metro cities, project areas tend to be smaller due to lack of large land parcel.\u000a4. New project launches expected to be delayed\u000a Now, new residential projects will be launched after getting requisite clearance from the government, which ideally takes 2 to 3 years. So, in short term we expect some delays in the launch of new project.\u000aConclusion\u000a Government seems to have taken the right decision of passing the much required Real Estate Regulatory Bill to control exploitation by developers which offered false amenities to buyers, construction of residential projects on disruptive land, etc. It's good to see there are standard parameters to analyse real estate sector and positives in this bill for common man. Expecting there will be positive turnaround in real estate sector and help buyers to find dream home at affordable price on time.\u000aInvestmentYogi.com is a leading personal finance portal.\u000aDisclaimer: All information in this article has been provided by InvestmentYogi.com and NDTV Profit is not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the same.\u000a

VNew Delhi: The government is readying to impose more curbs on steel imports, including introducing a safeguard duty, after a 20 per cent import tax failed to contain losses for producers such as Steel Authority of India.\u000aSAIL, JSW Steel and Essar Steel have complained that surging imports from Indonesia, China, Japan, Russia, Ukraine and South Korea were squeezing their market share and profit margins.\u000aIn October, steelmakers asked the government to impose a safeguard duty for four years on imports of hot rolled flat sheets and plates of alloy or non-alloy steel, and set a minimum import price, to contain cheaper steel imports.\u000aThe Directorate General of Safeguards, a branch of the Finance Ministry that can impose temporary import curbs, said on Tuesday that it found prima facie evidence that increases in imports "have caused or threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic producers".\u000aIn a statement on its website, the directorate said it has asked foreign companies and other stakeholders to submit their views within 30 days before taking a decision.\u000aIndian companies, struggling to compete due to high borrowing and raw materials costs, have in recent months successfully lobbied to get duties on some products and quality checks strengthened.\u000aIn September, India imposed the 20 per cent import tax on some steel products as the government initiated an investigation into rising imports from China, Japan, South Korea and Russia.\u000aGovernment sources said the steel ministry has also supported local manufacturers' demand to impose a minimum floor price for steel imports to curb cheaper imports.\u000aImports of iron and steel declined slightly to $6.9 billion during April-October period in the current financial year 2015-16 from $7.1 billion a year ago, Commerce and Industry Ministry data show.\u000aThe government has asked the industry to submit figures on the cost of production so that it could consider a floor price for imports, said one official, with knowledge of policy decisions.\u000a© Thomson Reuters 2015\u000a

VAward: Entrepreneur with social Impact\u000aChandra Shekhar Ghosh\u000aChairman and Managing Director, Bandhan Financial Services Pvt Ltd\u000aAge: 54\u000aInterests outside work: Reading, music and photography\u000aWhy he won this award: Creating a source of living for India\u2019s underprivileged and now looking to include over 58 lakh unbanked customers under the banking purview. And this is just the beginning\u000aIt took two defining moments for Chandra Shekhar Ghosh to get to where he is today. The first was an encounter with a woman and her three-year-old daughter in the interiors of West Bengal. This was in the 1990s, when Ghosh was a health officer with a local NGO. After observing the mother boiling a pot of rice outside her hut, while her daughter was busy making a meal of the dust and dirt around her, Ghosh stepped in and delivered a sermon on the importance of healthy habits. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the mother\u2019s reply,\u201d he says. \u201cShe told me, \u2018My daughter has been asking for fish for three days now. And today, I will make another false promise to her, knowing I cannot give her what she wants. That\u2019s what saddens me more than anything else\u2019.\u201d \u000aWhat moved Ghosh more than just the deprivation was her resignation to the situation.\u000aThe second instance also took place in West Bengal when a conversation with a vegetable vendor in one of Kolkata\u2019s busy markets brought home the tyranny of moneylending. The vendor was paying a moneylender an annual interest of about 700 percent on a daily loan of Rs 500. Every morning, he would borrow some money from the lender and return the principal amount with interest in the evening. \u201cThe vendor felt this was a good deal,\u201d says the 54-year-old Ghosh. \u201cHe told me that his daily interest was the equivalent of just two cups of tea, and argued that even if he managed the impossible and got a loan from a bank without a guarantor, he would be paying more than his current interest just on transport\u2014getting to and from the bank. The lender, on the other hand, would come to his house every evening to collect the dues.\u201d\u000aThese were the conversations playing in his head when Ghosh decided to start a microfinance organisation with the goal of lending money to women entrepreneurs who were marginalised by society but were willing to try their hand at a small-scale business. Bandhan was born in 2001. Five years later, he registered his organisation as a non-deposit taking, non-banking financial company (NBFC) with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and Bandhan became Bandhan Financial Services Pvt Ltd. It now provides loans to people in rural and semi-urban India irrespective of gender, though women empowerment remains its primary goal. \u000aEven at the inception stage, Ghosh knew that he wanted a long-term solution to poverty alleviation. \u201cI was never keen on an NGO model or charity because they are mostly for the short term,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to impact the lives of a large number of people who are not able to have food even twice a day. How can we contribute towards their well-being? First, there has to be a stable flow of income; only then can other areas like health and education be taken care of.\u201d\u000aFor 14 years, Bandhan Financial has remained true to its founder\u2019s philosophy. But now, the ever-evolving NBFC is preparing itself for its next big leap: It\u2019s on the cusp of becoming a full-fledged bank. If all goes as per plan, the proposed Bandhan Bank will be operational by the first quarter of the next financial year with an initial 600 branches across India. \u000a

VAFP image\u000aGhaziabad (UP):  Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh on Thursday hinted at a possible tie-up of his party with Congress in the post-poll scenario "for the sake of secularism".\u000a"Since we cannot go with the Third Front as Mayawati is already there, for the sake of secularism, we may be forced to look at Congress," Singh said while speaking to reporters in Ghaziabad.\u000aThe SP general secretary, however, added that his party's possible relationship with Congress "will be more on practical lines and it will not be a relationship of the heart".\u000aSingh also said his party did not believe in playing communal politics and could move towards Congress.\u000aEarlier in the day, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had said in Mainpuri that he would support anybody who would pull down Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government in Uttar Pradesh, which he described as "unconstitutional".\u000a

VRepresentational image.\u000aNew Delhi:  Government on Friday said it will bring a comprehensive law to criminalise marital rape by amending the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and was awaiting the Law Commission report on the issue.\u000a"The issue of marital rape is very complicated and it is very difficult to explain and describe it. These are of such extreme private nature and no records of any consent are available. The matter has been dealt in detail by a Parliamentary Committee as well as the Law Commission," Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said while replying to a debate on a private member bill.\u000aHe said the Parliamentary Committee in its report has recommended the need for a comprehensive review of the criminal system of law.\u000a"To move in peacemeal is not right. We have asked for comprehensive review and Law Commission also took up the matter.\u000aWe are awaiting the report and we want it to come early," the minister said.\u000aMr Rijiju added that the Law Commission "is very much in sync with us and sentiments of this House" and the government is not opposed to to the idea mooted by member Avinash Pande of Congress in the private member bill -- 'The Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2014'.\u000a"We are waiting for the appropriate suggestions from the Law Commission of India, and, the Parliamentary Standing Committee Report also has been mentioned during my reply. So, it is the fittest thing for us to wait for the Committee Report," he said.\u000aThe Minister said there is a specific clause under Section 498A, which already deals with cruelty against women.\u000a"It is a very specific provision and it is taking care of the problems being faced by the women, and we have expressed our concern also.... we should wait for the comprehensive report which we are waiting from the Law Commission of India.\u000a"Once that report comes, we will definitely come back to the House and seek the support of the member and the entire House.... We are expecting that the report will come as soon as possible," he said.\u000aDeputy Chairman PJ Kurien said, "If you think that rape by a husband is a crime, then, why should the government wait for the report? Rape is a crime, you accept it; whether it is a rape by a husband or any other person, it is equally a crime. You are tending to say that. But then, in that case, why do you wait for the Report? That is the question."\u000aMr Rijiju said, on July 6 2010, then Home Minister in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice made a request to the Law Commission of India to examine and give a comprehensive report covering all aspects of the criminal law so that comprehensive amendments can be made in various laws, especially, in the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure as well as the Indian Evidence Act.\u000a"These three Acts are being dealt with by Home Ministry. So, we have asked for comprehensive suggestions," he said.\u000aThe Law Commission of India also took up the matter for study and examination on October 11, 2013. Last year, he said, the Law Commission informed the Ministry of Home Affairs, that they have identified certain focus areas and formed sub-groups to deliberate on such areas, and, that the Commission is actively pursuing the issue and will finalise its views as early as possible.\u000a"So, I feel that the Law Commission is in very much sync with the sense of the House and the sentiments being expressed by the members. We also want that the Law Commission should submit its report as early as possible. We have also communicated recently that the comprehensive suggestions may be submitted to us as soon as possible," he said.\u000aParticipating in the debate, Husain Dalwai (Cong) said the bill seeks to criminalise the offence of marital rape by removing Exception (2) to Section 375 of the IPC Act which people say that this is against Indian family values.\u000a"I think the House should be very generous in passing this law," he pleaded.\u000a

VAnglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever said it had acquired a little over two-thirds of Indian unit Hindustan Unilever following the close of a voluntary tender offer, falling short of its plan to raise its stake to as much as 75 per cent.\u000aShareholders of Hindustan Unilever, India's largest consumer goods maker, tendered 319.7 million shares to the offer, taking Unilever's holding in the unit to 67.28 per cent from 52.48 per cent, Unilever said in a statement.\u000aUnilever, which makes products including detergent, soap, margarine and ice cream, paid 600 rupees per share, valuing the transaction at about 2.45 billion euros.\u000aEarlier this year, Unilever said it planned to pay up to $5.4 billion to raise its stake in Hindustan Unilever to as much as 75 per cent, as part of a strategy to increase its presence in fast-growing emerging markets.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a

VImage via Zomato\u000aThe power of social media is only half understood and grudgingly accepted. One of the recent occasions when social media was proven to be a fantastic tool was during the Chennai floods where relief efforts were coordinated via Twitter. More recently, and on a lighter note, social media has also done something incredible during the ongoing visit of HRH Prince Williams and Duchess Kate.\u000aAn iconic Parsi restaurant in Mumbai, Britannia & Co., is popular for three things. It\u2019s sinful Berry Pulao (though we prefer the keema salli there), the personal touch of being served by 3 generations of the owner\u2019s family (including the cat who sits on the cash counter as if it were a throne) and the owner\u2019s love for British Royalty. The entire restaurant is testimony to the last, with photos of the Queen, letters sent from her office and many such remembrances.\u000aCall it a dream of sorts or a life-long fantasy, but when Boman Kohinoor, the 93 year old owner of Britannia heard about the royal visit, he started a campaign on social media, requesting for an audience. What started with a whisper, with the help of a media house, eventually snowballed into a crowd-sourced plea, with a hashtag #WillKatMeetMe dedicated to it. People were touched by this eagerness, and helped spread the word. And spread it did, like wild fire.\u000aAnd like all Bollywood films, in the end, everything turns out well. Amidst a \u2018super\u2019 hectic schedule, Prince William and Duchess Kate actually invited Boman to come and meet them at the Taj Hotel before a gala charity reception arranged in their honour (where they met the who\u2019s who of Mumbai\u2019s film industry and corporate world).\u000aPhoto credit: Condé Nast Traveller\u000aWith stars in his eyes, Boman told Condé Nast Traveller, \u201cI met Their Royal Highnesses this evening at the Taj. They were very kind and asked me about my restaurant and my favourite dishes there. I told them about the berry pulao and how it\u2019s made using my late wife\u2019s recipe. They asked me if I could cook. I said no, but I serve my customers well. I told them: give my love to the Queen, and to [your] children Prince George and Princess Charlotte, too. I wish I had more time to speak, but I\u2019m thankful for this opportunity.\u201d\u000aThis was of course, a miracle come true for this much loved owner of legendary Britannia, but more symbolically, a reinforcement for the common man that if you wish for something you really want, and put all your energies into getting it, you will find a way to achieve it.\u000aAsk Boman Kohinoor, he did.\u000a

Now she knows she wants a big family," the source added.\u000a

VPrime Minister Narendra Modi released two commemorative coins as part of the 125th birth anniversary year celebrations of B R Ambedkar.\u000aNew Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi today released two commemorative coins of R 125 and R 10 denomination as part of the 125th birth anniversary year celebrations of Dr B R Ambedkar.\u000aThe coins were issued on his death anniversary, which is being observed as "Mahaparinirvan Divas of Babasaheb Ambedkar".\u000aAddressing a gathering at his residence, the Prime Minister said that there were only a few individuals who remain alive in public consciousness, even 60 years after their death.\u000aHe said the more one recalls Dr Ambedkar's thoughts, in the context of issues currently faced by India, "the more we come to respect his vision and his approach to inclusiveness".\u000aThe Prime Minister said that while his contributions towards social justice have been recognised, his economic thoughts and vision are still not fully understood, and these need to be appreciated.\u000aPM Modi said Dr Ambedkar and the Constitution of India should always be discussed and talked about in this country, and the observance of Constitution Day on November 26, was a step in that direction.\u000aHe appreciated Dr Ambedkar's vision on subjects such as women empowerment, India's federal structure, finance and education, a press release issued by Prime Minister's Office said.\u000aFinance Minister Arun Jaitley and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot were present on the occasion.\u000aEarlier in the day, PM Modi paid floral tribute at the Dalit mascot's statue in Parliament House lawns. "Remembering Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar on his Punya Tithi," he posted on Twitter along with a photograph showing him and Dr Ambedkar's statue.\u000a

VThe driver is heard shouting "crush him!"\u000aRussians reacted with shock Friday and prosecutors launched an inquiry after a YouTube video went viral showing a train apparently mowing down a bear on the tracks as the driver shouts "crush him!"\u000aShot at night from the front of a train, the video shows the train speeding through a snowy landscape, as a bear with snow on its back can be seen vainly attempting to outrun it on the tracks ahead.\u000a"Be quiet!" a male voice can be heard saying, before shouting: "Crush him! Crush him!". As the bear disappears under the front of the train, the man shouts: "Got him!"\u000aThe reflection of a phone being used to make the video can be seen in the train's windscreen. At the end, the buttons of a dashboard can be seen, showing that it was shot in the train's cabin.\u000aThe video on YouTube has been watched more than 70,000 times.\u000aRossiya 24 news channel condemned what it called a "monstrous incident."\u000aTransport prosecutors in Norilsk, a Siberian city around 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) northeast of Moscow beyond the Arctic Circle, said they were looking into what happened.\u000aThey said that the video was believed to have been shot around 2 am on Thursday on private tracks used by the metals giant Norilsk Nickel inside the city of Norilsk.\u000a"Watching the video, we got the impression that the train's crew is deliberately speeding up and isn't trying to avoid a collision," Oksana Gorbunova, a senior aide to West Siberian transport prosecutors, told NTV television.\u000a"We are carrying out a check not because we are sorry for the bear but to check the legality of the crew's actions."\u000aA spokesman for Norilsk Nickel later told Govorit Moskva radio station that the bear had apparently survived after being hit by the snow plough on the front of the train.\u000a"We contacted our colleagues in Norilsk. They said the bear is alive. The board on the front that is used to clean snow from tracks just threw the bear onto the verge," spokesman Pyotr Likholitov said, adding "the animal probably did not suffer serious injuries."\u000aSearchers will look for the wounded bear, which could be aggressive and pose a danger to people, Gazeta.ru news site reported, citing Norilsk Nickel staff.\u000a2\u000a

VItanagar/New Delhi:  In what has the makings of a controversy, former Army Chief and the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, General JJ Singh, has said that India should do away with its non-negotiable stand on the border dispute with China.\u000aThe General said, "It is important to solve the India-China border dispute and for that some give and take is necessary. India will have to move away from our position that our territory is non-negotiable."\u000aAddressing a national seminar on Indo-China relations organised by the Indian Council of Social Science Research and Rajiv Gandhi University, General Singh also urged for normalisation of relations between India and China.\u000a"The world has changed and we are a much more confident nation now. It is important to realise that we need a speedy resolution to the Indo-China boundary dispute and for that some give-and-take may be necessary."\u000a

VKabul:  Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who is on a four-day visit to India, tells NDTV in an exclusive interview that the US "can't be aggressive" or "intimidate" him to sign a troop deal post 2014.\u000aHe has stalled the deal to allow bases with up to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of combat personnel. He wants attacks on Afghan homes to be stopped and a peace process with the Taliban started.\u000aSpeaking to NDTV from his palace in Kabul before flying to India, Mr Karzai said, "We will be here whether the US is here or not. That is where we are. This is our country. But of course we may be in more trouble. We may be poorer in certain ways. But Afghanistan can continue and will survive as it has for thousands of years."\u000aOn being asked whether he perceived America's statements as threats, he added, "They do at times behave like that...Allies should not be waging psychological war against each other. They need not attack us psychologically. They need not weaken our resolve. They need not portray as if we are in such terrible need that if they are not here, we are neither a nation nor a country nor a history nor a culture nor a future. That's not right."\u000a'AFGHAN SACRIFICES BIGGER THAN AMERICAN'\u000aPresident Karzai also told NDTV that he appreciated the sacrifices the Americans had made but insisted that Afghans "had sacrificed more."\u000a"They do certain times behave in a manner that's not becoming of a big power. And we hope they recognize and change that. We are good friends with them. We have given immense sacrifice in the war on terror. No country has given as much sacrifice as we have. We recognize the blood and treasure they have spent in Afghanistan. That's a sacrifice we appreciate considerably. By comparison, Afghanistan has given much more sacrifice of its people, children, women, territory, environment and time. So our sacrifice is greater and if it's a war on terror then Afghanistan is the bigger partner."\u000a'US AGGRESSION, INTIMIDATION WILL NOT WORK'\u000aWhen questioned on whether there was a need to lower the rhetoric, he added, "aggressive rhetoric will not force us in to signing. We are not known as a nation for intimidation. If they have not recognized it, they should recognise it now."\u000aKARZAI HARD-BALL ON TROOP DEAL\u000aThe US had initially insisted on the post 2014 troop deal being signed before the end of the year. But statements out of Washington by the Af-Pak Special representative James Dobbins indicate an easing of that deadline. President Karzai, who had also set up a Loya Jirga (Council of Leaders and elders) that unanimously endorsed the deal in November, has refused to sign it just yet, setting more conditions after negotiations had already ended.\u000aKARZAI LEGACY: NOT A MODERN DAY SHAH SHUJA\u000aPresident Karzai's hard-ball stubbornness not to sign the BSA (Bilateral security agreement) immediately is seen by top officials as an attempt to stay relevant in the run-up to scheduled presidential polls in April 2014 and not be perceived as lame-duck. Analysts say he also wants to go down in history as someone who stood up to all foreign powers. He is acutely aware, many officials say, of the need for an anti-America legacy.\u000aOfficials who have closely interacted with him say Hamid Karzai is closely aware of the history surrounding the reviled 19th century monarch Shah Shuja. From the same Pasthun sub-clan as the infamous king, the President, Afghan experts say, doesn't want to be painted as a modern day Shah Shuja, a ruler imposed by foreigners who is destined to meet the same end--despised as a puppet of foreign powers--and killed by his own people.\u000a

VMumbai:  Lakhs of commuters and students were inconvenienced on Monday as one of Mumbai's biggest auto rickshaw unions went on a day's strike in the suburbs.\u000aThe action by Sharad Rao's Mumbai Autorickshawmen's Union (MAU) came despite a Re.1 hike on the minimum fare - from R11 to R12 - permitted by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) last week.\u000aOver 20,000 autos owing allegiance to the MAU went off the roads from midnight while the unions commanded by Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena opposed the strike.\u000aThe other unions, despite a low strength compared to MAU, attempted to fill the void by offering services to commuters, including shared trips to clear the morning peak hour rush, but it was not enough.\u000aCommuters had to wait in long, serpentine queues at BEST bus stops, while students, many appearing for their final examinations, had to sacrifice an hour of study to ensure they reached exam centres on time.\u000aThe short supply created by the strike was diverted to BEST buses, which were crowded despite extra buses being deployed to counter the agitation.\u000aA livid Haresh Shah, who waited in a BEST queue for nearly an hour before getting his bus, demanded inclusion of all forms of public transport under essential services - "How can a small group hold to ransom the entire commuting population of the city," he asked.\u000aPriya Ghanekar, working in a private company in Andheri, said during such autorickshaw strikes, taxis must be permitted to make special trips in the suburbs and clear the rush of commuters.\u000aThere are a total of over 100,000 autorickshaws plying the Mumbai's eastern and western suburbs.\u000a"We shall not be participating in the strike as the transport department from the state government has already approved Re.1 hike in the fare," said Haji Arafat Sheikh of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena-led Vahatuk Sena.\u000aThe Shiv-Sena led Rickshaw Chalak Malak Sena also opposed the strike. "We have asked our drivers to not be intimidated by the tactics of the Sharad Rao-led union," an office-bearer said.\u000aK.K. Tiwari, leader of the Swabhimaan Sanghatna, headed by Nitish Rane, son of Industry Minister Narayan Rane, said the strike was pointless as the fare had already been hiked from April 20.\u000aLast week, MAU's Rao had announced a state-wide indefinite strike affecting nearly one million autorickshaws.\u000aHowever, after lack of co-operation by most other unions and the RTA permitting a marginal fare hike, Rao backtracked and converted it into a daylong token strike.\u000a

VMumbai:  The special CBI court, which rejected the bail pleas of the seven accused in the Adarsh Housing Society case last week, has observed that involvement of high-profile persons affected the pace of the probe.\u000a"Because of the high personalities involved, investigation did not take its own pace," observed special judge M V Kulkarni.\u000aOn April 4, the judge rejected the bail applications of former Maharashtra legislator K L Gidwani, bureaucrat Pradeep Vyas, Major General (retd) T K Kaul, Major General (retd) A R Kumar, Brigadier (retd) M M Wanchoo, retired Defence Estates Officer R C Thakur and former Deputy Secretary in state Urban Development Department P V Deshmukh.\u000aIn the detailed order, which became available today, the court has added that some progress has been made, and the investigation is at a crucial stage.\u000aThe accused had sought bail on the ground that investigations were over. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said that they might tamper with evidence and threaten witnesses.\u000aThe case pertains to alleged irregularities in the construction, and allotment of apartments, in the 31-storey high-rise Adarsh in south Mumbai.\u000a

VSony said on Tuesday it aimed to fully restore its PlayStation Network, which was shut down after a massive security breach affecting over 100 million online accounts, by the end of May.\u000a\u000aSony also confirmed that personal data from 24.6 million user accounts was stolen in the hacker attack last month. Personal data, including credit card numbers, might have been stolen from another 77 million PlayStation accounts, said Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. spokesman Satoshi Fukuoka.\u000a\u000aHe said Sony has not received any reports of illegal uses of stolen information, and the company is continuing its probe into the hacker attack. He declined to give details on the investigation.\u000a\u000aSony shut down the PlayStation network, a system that links gamers worldwide in live play, on April 20 after discovering the security breach. The network also allows users to upgrade and download games and other content.\u000a\u000aSony was under heavy criticism over its handling of the network intrusion. The company did not notify consumers of the breach until April 26 even though it began investigating unusual activity on the network since April 19.\u000a\u000aLast month, U.S. lawyers filed a lawsuit against Sony on behalf of lead plaintiff Kristopher Johns for negligent protection of personal data and failure to inform players in a timely fashion that their credit card information may have been stolen. The lawsuit seeks class-action status.\u000a\u000aFukuoka declined to comment on the lawsuit.

VKangana Ranaut started working early at the age of 17.\u000aHimachal girl Kangana Ranaut entered filmdom with hit crime-romance Gangster - A Love story and the actress, whose latest release Shootout At Wadala also did well, feels gangster thrillers are lucky for her.\u000a"I think gangster-based films are very lucky for me. My debut film Gangster in 2006 was successful, then came Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai and now Shootout At Wadala," the 26-year-old said here Tuesday at the success bash of Shootout At Wadala.\u000aDirected by Sanjay Gupta, Shootout At Wadala is the story of Mumbai police's first official encounter in which they shot dead gangster Manya Surve. In the film, John Abraham plays Manya, while Kangana Ranaut is seen as his love interest Vidya Joshi. \u000a In her seven-year-long career, Kangana tried her hands at romance and comedy as well with Woh Lamhe, Double Dhamaal and Tanu Weds Manu. If these films did well at the box office, Kangana too got accolades for her performances.\u000aWhen asked about her reaction on being sidelined in favour of other actresses -Priyanka Chopra, Sunny Leone and Sophie Choudry during Shootout At Wadala pr-release promotions, Kangana said: "This is producers' decision how they want to promote their film. Actors should not interfere in such things and actors like me don't even do that."\u000a"These are minor things, so there is no point feeling sad or ignored. Moreover, whatever is best for the film should be done," she added.\u000aShe concluded by saying: "I have been working since I was 17 and have completed seven years here. So when you have that much experience, you know that films come and go. They are not everything. We do also have our own life."\u000a

VBangalore:  Buta Singh, Chairman of National Commission for SC/ST, mired in a bribery case in which his son was arrested, is still defiant.\u000aHe said that he has spoken to Prime Minster Manmohan Singh and briefed him about the political conspiracy.\u000aButa Singh claims the CBI is using his son Sarobjit Singh to target him and he is ready to answer any question if the CBI interrogates him. Buta Singh categorically said that he will not resign from his post.\u000aMeanwhile, the CBI has got more leads in the bribery case involving Buta Singh's son Sarobjit Singh.\u000aThe house of a suspected Bangalore-based hawala operator, Dhuk Singh, was searched by the CBI where some incriminating documents were seized.\u000aHe is the third hawala operator the CBI has picked up.\u000aEarlier, the CBI joined by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the Hawala trail behind the bribery scandal in which Buta Singh and his son have been implicated.\u000aMeanwhile, Buta Singh, the Chairman of the National Commission for SC and ST, said there is no question of his resigning from the post.\u000a"Why should I resign? I have served the nation for 50 years. I will not run. I will fight," he said.\u000a Buta's son Sarabjot was arrested on charges of accepting a R 1 crore bribe from a Nasik-based contractor.\u000aThe CBI wants to know what role Buta may have played in the crime and how much he knew of his son's activities?\u000aButa Singh has been implicated by a key suspect -- Congressman Anup Beghe who has told the CBI that Singh was present at the meeting where the bribe was discussed.\u000aHowever, in his defence, Sarabjot has claimed that his father knew that Ramarao Patil was trying to bribe him and that Buta Singh had in fact written to the Nashik Police Commissioner complaining about it.\u000aHis claims apart, Sarabjot will now have to deal with another case -- of illegally possessing a revolver found when the CBI raided his Delhi residence on Friday.\u000aWith the entry of the Enforcement Directorate it's clear that the CBI is following the money trail to build a strong case against Sarabjot and possibly his father as well.\u000a

VMap of Colombia\u000aBogota, Colombia:  Colombia's leftist FARC guerrillas freed an army general Sunday in a concession to revive peace talks, but the president refused to budge on their calls for a ceasefire.\u000aTwo weeks after sending the peace process into crisis by capturing Brigadier General Ruben Alzate, their highest-ranking captive in 50 years of conflict, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia handed him and two other army captives over to the Red Cross in the jungle-covered department of Choco.\u000a"Freed... in perfect condition," tweeted President Juan Manuel Santos, who suspended the peace talks on which he has staked his presidency over Alzate's capture.\u000aThe move paves the way for the two sides to resume the two-year-old talks in the Cuban capital Havana, the most promising bid yet to end the conflict.\u000aBut no sooner had Alzate been freed than the FARC and Santos were at loggerheads again over the issue of a ceasefire.\u000aSantos has repeatedly refused to consider a bilateral ceasefire without a peace agreement, on grounds that the rebels would use it to regroup, lengthening the war.\u000aIn a statement from Havana, the FARC urged him to reconsider.\u000a"The time has come for a bilateral ceasefire, or an armistice, so that no act of war in the fields of battle can be used to justify the interruption" of the peace process, they said.\u000aThey urged the government to "redesign the rules of the game" as the peace talks take up the most sensitive issues: disarmament and reparations for victims.\u000aBut although Santos said he would meet with the government's negotiating team to discuss "the terms of their return to Havana," he appeared unwilling to yield on a ceasefire.\u000aNegotiating amid conflict\u000a"I'm convinced that negotiating in the midst of the conflict has been the best way to preserve the essential elements of the state and prevent the talks from becoming an interminable exercise," the president said.\u000aHe praised Alzate's release, however, saying it "contributes to recovering a favorable climate to continue the talks (and) demonstrates the maturity of the process."\u000aAlzate, 55, heads a task force charged with fighting the rebels and drug traffickers rife in Choco, a remote western department that is Colombia's poorest.\u000aHe was captured with Corporal Jorge Rodriguez and army adviser Gloria Urrego on November 16 as they traveled by boat to visit a civilian energy project.\u000aThe FARC defended their capture as a legitimate act of war.\u000aCuba and Norway announced on November 19 that a deal had been reached for the FARC to release the three captives, plus two soldiers captured in combat on November 9, in order to get the talks back on track.\u000aThe two soldiers were freed last Tuesday.\u000aAlzate, Rodriguez and Urrego were released Sunday morning on the banks of the Arquia River in northeastern Choco, on a day drenched by a tropical rainstorm.\u000aThe Red Cross said they were in good health and had been flown by helicopter to second city Medellin.\u000aAfter being reunited with his family, Alzate will have to appear before Congress, which has summoned him to testify on his capture and explain why he was traveling in civilian clothes without a security escort.\u000aImpact on talks\u000aThe secretary general of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Insulza, praised the release and voiced hope that "once this obstacle has been satisfactorily overcome, peace negotiations will be restarted as soon as possible."\u000aNo date has been set for the resumption of talks.\u000aThe speed with which the crisis was resolved showed that "both sides want to continue the peace process and avoid an escalation," said Angelika Rettberg, an expert on the negotiations.\u000aThe talks in Havana, the fourth attempt at a peace deal, have made halting progress since they began in November 2012, but a comprehensive peace agreement remains elusive.\u000aGetting them back on a sound footing may not be easy, some observers said.\u000a"In the long run, this episode will be felt in Havana," said Christian Voelkel, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.\u000aThe FARC's leader, Timoleon Jimenez, alias Timochenko, warned pointedly last week that the government's suspension had "destroyed trust," adding: "Things can't just resume as they were."\u000aThe Colombian conflict has killed more than 220,000 people and uprooted 5.3 million more since the FARC was founded in the aftermath of a peasant uprising in 1964.\u000a

VTexas Governor Rick Perry Answers Questions During An Interview With The Associated Press\u000aAUSTIN,Texas:  Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry said he won't make up his mind about running for president until the middle of next year, but he doesn't feel pressure to announce sooner because most people expect that he will.\u000a"People think we're going to run, and that's not necessarily a bad thing," Perry said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press as he prepares to leave office next month after 14 years as governor.\u000aWhile a formal announcement may be a ways off, the longest-serving chief executive in Texas history sounded like a candidate preparing for his next campaign.\u000aPerry cited his state's low taxes, restrained regulatory climate and caps on civil lawsuit damages as the reasons behind Texas' economic success.\u000aHe argued the state's record in creating jobs during his time in office can convince potentially skeptical supporters that he's worth a second look after his short-lived 2012 presidential bid.\u000aAnother Perry campaign will undoubtedly include numerous recounting of his "Oops" moment in a debate among Republican candidates in 2011, when that word was all he could muster after he forgot the name of the third of three federal departments he'd promised to shutter if elected.\u000aAsked if those who supported him in 2012 might shy away this time given the results, Perry said: "I think people are going to make a decision based on what they see over the next couple of years, not what they saw four years ago.\u000a"There's not going to be a lot of hope in this country," Perry said, if people don't have the ability to recover from their past mistakes.\u000aPerry also departs the governor's mansion facing charges of felony abuse of power and the prospect that a court case could drag on for months and land him in prison.\u000aYet Perry said he's confident voters are willing to give him a second chance.\u000aPerry's failed presidential campaign remains the only loss of his political career. He was the state's powerful lieutenant governor when then-Texas Governor George W. Bush was elected president, and he went on to win three terms.\u000aHe has spent much of his final year as governor meeting privately with policy experts and traveling in the U.S. and abroad - an effort viewed by most as aimed at improving his credentials for a White House bid.\u000aIn an email to supporters late Monday, Perry said he and his wife, Anita, "hosted more than one hundred business and political leaders from around the country in Austin" last week, describing attendees as both longtime supporters and new contacts.\u000a"I think people are responsive to a candidate that has proven that that they are substantially better prepared and reflecting," Perry said.\u000aPerry was able to raise money with ease during the first months of his 2012 bid. But he refused to discuss Tuesday whether those same donors are willing to invest in him again, or whether they might be spooked by the allegations that his veto of state funding for public corruption prosecutors amounts to criminal abuse of power.\u000aBill Miller, an Austin-based Republican consultant who has worked for both Perry and some of his opponents, said Perry will have to show he's a viable candidate in order to expand his donor base beyond Texas.\u000a"Last time the expectations were sky-high. Now they're rock bottom, " Miller said.\u000aPerry insists he'll be a better prepared should he run again, ready to withstand the barrage from potential primary opponents' ads featuring his "Oops" moment.\u000a

VAmazon is in talks with a consortium of German carmakers about taking a stake in high-definition digital mapping company Here , two auto industry sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aLast August, BMW, Audi and Mercedes agreed to pay EUR 2.5 billion (roughly Rs. 18,580 crores) to buy Nokia's mapping business as part of plans to develop self-driving cars.\u000a\u000aSince then, the consortium has started negotiations with potential new partners mainly from the automotive industry.\u000a\u000aNow, online retailer Amazon has emerged as a possible shareholder.\u000a\u000a"Amazon would take a stake as part of a broader deal to lock them in as a provider of cloud computing services," one source familiar with the talks said.\u000a\u000aThe consortium needs the capacity of cloud computing to ensure that maps can cope with live updates on traffic and road conditions using data collected from sensors on thousands of Mercedes, BMW and Audi cars.\u000a\u000aIt has been in talks with cloud computing providers, including Amazon, one of the sources said.\u000a\u000aTaking a stake in Here could make sense strategically for Amazon, which is rolling out new one- and two-hour delivery services in major cities in the United States and Europe and needs accurate, real-time maps to compete with rivals for the best logistics.\u000a\u000aIntelligent mapping systems like Here's are the basis on which self-driving cars, linked to wireless networks, can perform functions such as recalculating a route to the nearest electric charging station or around a traffic jam or ice patch.\u000a\u000aFor the consortium, having more partners will spread the cost and could improve the volume of data about traffic information being fed to the map from vehicles on the road.\u000a\u000aAudi, the premium brand owned by Volkswagen, Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, and BMW declined to comment on whether they were in talks with Amazon.\u000a\u000aAmazon in Germany and the United States did not respond to requests to comment.\u000a\u000aBMW said: "The new owners Audi, Daimler and BMW have said from the start that they are open for new partners to join. We have noticed that there is lots of interest not only from potential partners from within the automotive industry, but also from other sectors."\u000a\u000aRenault and automotive supplier Continental have both expressed interest.\u000a\u000aContinental said on Thursday a decision on whether to buy a stake in Here would be made within the next few months.\u000a\u000aFord is also among the companies interested in taking a stake in the Here consortium, a third auto industry source said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aAsked whether Ford was in talks with the group about taking a stake in Here, a spokesman for the company said, "We have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects related to our Ford Smart Mobility plan. We keep these discussions private for obvious competitive reasons and we don't comment on speculation."\u000a\u000aSelf-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have estimated.\u000a\u000aGermany's carmakers decided to club together to bid for Here to accelerate plans for self-driving cars after Internet rival Alphabet unveiled a prototype autonomous vehicle.

VParineeti Chopra Fears Being 'Judged' For Her Personal Life\u000a\u000a"Just about my love life, I would like to be private, because there is so much scrutiny in there. There are so many people in the world who are looking at you and judging you. I just don't want that between me and my partner. And as respect to my partner, I shouldn't be talking about it," Parineeti Chopra said

VNew Delhi:\u000aAir India's Dreamliner fleet suffered 136 "minor" technical problems between their delivery since September last year and till late last month and all these problems were fixed by technical teams of the airline and Boeing, Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said on Monday.\u000aObserving that a Boeing team was currently in India to upgrade the software in these planes, he said each Boeing 787 Dreamliner is being grounded for ten days since the beginning of this month for maintenance and these upgrades.\u000aObserving that Air India was constantly in touch with Boeing on the issue of technical reliability of these new aircraft, he said a team of engineers and technicians from the American manufacturer was installing a reliability enhancement package involving upgrades to the software and components in the aircraft.\u000aThe Boeing team is also involved in the root cause analysis and evolving remedial measures, he said. Regarding a panel falling out of the belly of one Dreamliner as it landed in Bengaluru few months ago, Singh said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was probing the incident and its report is awaited.\u000aOn the overseas battery-fire incident this January involving the same aircraft operated by a Japanese carrier and consequential grounding of Dreamliners the world over, the minister said the requisite rectification was carried out on the battery units of the aircraft of Air India, following which the planes were put back in service in May.\u000a

VNew Delhi:  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has retaliated to a dare by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who urged him earlier this week to testify on the telecom scam for a parliamentary committee unless he has "something to hide." (Read Yashwant Sinha's letter to PM)\u000a"I have said from the beginning that neither the Government nor I have anything to hide in this matter," the PM responded today. (Read full statement)\u000aHis office said it has submitted all documents solicited by a parliamentary committee that's studying the swindle. The Prime Minister said it is up to the committee to decide who to summon.\u000a'If PM says his conscience is clear he should appear before JPC... By not deposing before JPC, it appears PM has something to hide," Mr Sinha said in response to the PM's remarks.\u000aThe Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) is headed by PC Chacko, a Congressman. Mr Chacko today said that there is a procedure that the JPC has to follow to summon the PM. "The PM has never said he will appear before the JPC on the 2G case... Why will the PM appear before the JPC if he has not been summoned?" said Mr Chacko, adding, "There is no question of calling the Prime Minister or any minister just like that."\u000aMr Sinha, who is a member of the JPC, has said that the Prime Minister was aware of the alleged malpractices employed by A Raja, who was Telecom Minister in 2008.\u000aLast year, the Supreme Court cancelled 122 telecom licenses issued by Mr Raja, who has spent over a year in jail, is on trial for criminal charges, and claims that the Prime Minister and Finance Minister P Chidambaram were aware of the policies he followed and must therefore be held accountable for any irregularities.\u000aMr Raja has been urging the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which has nearly 30 lawmakers from different parties, to hear him out in person. But the committee has refused.\u000aMr Sinha claimed that in his notes to the committee, Mr Raja has levelled "serious allegations" against the Prime Minister and Finance Minister P Chidambaram and that they should explain his statements.

VNew Delhi:  The university system was not producing "well-educated" graduates to meet needs of Indian companies, giving an opportunity to firms to enter the sector in the "guise" of training, Minister of State for Higher Education Shashi Tharoor on Monday said.\u000aHe also said that the national education policy in the past has been out of step with the times.\u000a"The major problem remains that our national education policy in the past has remained out of step with the time. Whereas countries in the Middle-East and China are going out of their way to woo foreign universities to set up campuses in their countries, India turned away many academic suitors who have come calling in recent years," he said.\u000aSpeaking at a two-day Higher Education Summit in New Delhi, Mr Tharoor said, "Companies are entering the higher education space in the guise of training. Our University system simply is not producing well- educated graduates to meet the needs of Indian companies today."\u000aThe HRD Minister said there will be no need for many Indian students to go abroad to study if good higher education institutes were set up in the country. "We will also work towards putting our reform agenda back on track," he added.\u000aMr Tharoor said there is a proposal to establish 50 centres for research in frontier areas of science, design innovation centres, innovation centres in different universities and also research parts of the IITs and other technical institutions.\u000a"If finally established, it would transform the research environment in our country," he said.\u000a

VThough Facebook bans children under 13, millions of them have profiles on the site by lying about their age.\u000a\u000aNow, the company is testing out ways to allow younger kids on its site without needing to lie. It would be under parental supervision, such as by connecting children's accounts to their parents' accounts. That would allow Facebook to comply with federal regulations regarding children under 13 online.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal reported on the development in Monday's editions. It could be a long way off, or never get implemented, as happens with many features that Facebook tests.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Facebook says it is in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, regulators and other policymakers about how best to help parents keep their kids safe online.

"We're moving ahead well, and I expect we'll complete our work in the early part of 2014."\u000a\u000aOutgoing Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer last month said the computer giant had to reinvent itself as the company struggles to keep up in the mobile devices sector.\u000a\u000a(Also see: Bill Gates highlights tough requirements for new Microsoft CEO)\u000a\u000a"Unless you're constantly inventing something new, you're old and tired," Ballmer said at a conference in Rome.

VFacebook is influencing what news gets read online as people use the Internet's most popular hangout to share and recommend content.\u000a\u000aThat's one of the key findings from a study on the flow of traffic to the Web's 25 largest news destinations. The study was released Monday by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism.\u000a\u000aFacebook was responsible for 3 percent of traffic to the 21 news sites that allowed data to be tracked, according to the study's co-author, Amy Mitchell. Five of the sites studied got 6 percent to 8 percent of their readers from Facebook.\u000a\u000aThe referrals typically came from links posted by friends on Facebook's social-networking site or from the ubiquitous "like" buttons, which Facebook encourages other websites to place alongside their content.\u000a\u000aThe Facebook effect is small compared with Google's clout. Google Inc.'s dominant search engine supplies about 30 percent of traffic to the top news sites, according to Pew.\u000a\u000aBut Facebook and other sharing tools, such as Addthis.com, are empowering people to rely on their online social circles to point out interesting content. By contrast, Google uses an automated formula to help people find news.\u000a\u000aFacebook is at the forefront of this shift because it has more than 500 million worldwide users. That's far more than any other Internet service built for socializing and sharing.\u000a\u000a"If searching for the news was the most important development of the last decade, sharing the news may be among the most important of the next," the Pew report said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, major news sites are getting less than 1 percent of their traffic from Twitter, even though it had about 175 million accounts last year.\u000a\u000aAmong those studied by Pew, only the Los Angeles Times' website got more traffic from Twitter than Facebook. Twitter accounted for 3.5 percent of the online traffic to the Los Angeles Times, compared with slightly more than 2 percent from Facebook.\u000a\u000aThe Drudge Report, a site started during the 1990s, is a far more significant traffic source for news sites than Twitter, according to the Pew study.\u000a\u000aThe Pew report is based on an analysis of Internet traffic data compiled by the research firm Nielsen Co. during the first nine months of last year.

VAccording to reports, China's Zangmu hydroelectric project was operationalised in October last year, said Union Minister Sanwar Lal Jat.\u000aNew Delhi:  The government has urged China to ensure that interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activity in upstream areas of the Brahmaputra river, Lok Sabha was informed today.\u000aUnion Minister of State for Water Resources Sanwar Lal Jat made the statement in reply to queries on whether China's dam construction in upper Tibet area is causing a drop in water level in Brahmaputra in Assam and said the government "carefully" monitors all developments on the river.\u000a"India has urged China to ensure the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas," Mr Jat said.\u000aThe minister said, according to reports, China's Zangmu hydroelectric project was operationalised in October, 2015.\u000aThe outline of the 12th Five Year Plan for the People's Republic of China indicates that three more hydropower projects on the mainstream of Brahmaputra river in Tibet Autonomous Region have been approved for implementation, he said.\u000a"These four projects are considered to be run of the river (RoR) hydroelectric projects. As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the river, India has conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities, including at the highest levels of the Government of the People's Republic of China," Mr Jat added.\u000aThe minister said in 2006 the two sides established an India-China Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) on trans-border rivers and in October, 2013, the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding on strengthening cooperation on trans-border rivers, he said.\u000aSubsequently, Mr Jat said, a joint statement was issued during the visit of Prime Minister of India to China in May, 2015 which stated, "The two sides will further strengthen cooperation through the expert-level mechanisms, on the provision of flood season hydrological data and emergency management, and exchange views on other issues of mutual interest."\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VAdam Sharp fits in well in the Beltway political scene where he used to work -- first in the office of Senator Mary L. Landrieu, and then as the executive producer for digital services at C-Span. But his new job, as Twitter's Washington liaison, requires a slightly different skill set.\u000a\u000aNow Mr. Sharp, a 32-year-old with brown hair, glasses and a sprinkling of pale freckles across his face, is the human embodiment of Twitter, an energetic and smiling ambassador for that ubiquitous blue bird, ready and willing to answer questions, troubleshoot and offer free tips.\u000a\u000aWhen Twitter hired Mr. Sharp late last year, his job was not to convince a few slow-to-adapt House members that they needed to get with the times. Instead, he is trying to help the thousands of politicians and government employees already on Twitter to use it better.\u000a\u000aSince he officially began work on Dec. 1, the job has been evolving. (When Republicans regained control of the House, Mr. Sharp helped the chamber's new leaders seamlessly switch their Twitter handles to reflect their new roles, John A. Boehner, for example, upgraded from @GOPLeader to @SpeakerBoehner.)\u000a\u000a"His job strikes me as making lots of friends and helping lots of people, and who would not return a phone call from Twitter these days?" said Howard Mortman, the communications director for C-Span, who worked with Mr. Sharp. "I think he is getting incredible access, the kind of access many folks would be jealous of, because he is offering a service that many people want these days."\u000a\u000aMr. Sharp was an obvious choice for the job. He has always had something of a geeky, techie side, and has been known to walk around Capitol Hill greeting people by their Twitter handles. When he proposed to his wife, he laid everything out first in an elaborate PowerPoint presentation -- complete with satellite photos of the exact spot in Rock Creek Park where he planned to drop to one knee.\u000a\u000aTwitter officials, who did not make Mr. Sharp available for an interview, emphasize that he is not a lobbyist. In fact, he is not even trying to sell politicians on the virtues of Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It is really easy to get the passion and excitement that he has for the product and for the mission of getting more government and political folks on Twitter, and that was important to us," said Alexander Macgillivray, Twitter's general counsel, explaining the company's decision to make Mr. Sharp its manager of government and political partnerships. "The goal is just increasing the great content that's on Twitter, and the focus is on government and political actors."\u000a\u000aThe company has grown from its infancy -- when many people thought it was yet another social media platform for telling your friends what you ate for lunch -- to a fully evolved business with 200 million registered users who understand that Twitter can be a powerful information tool.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of its increased use of social media under its administrator, W. Craig Fugate, stopped by Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco this month. Twitter offered technical expertise, and the agency helped Twitter understand how it could better serve its users in an emergency.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Mr. Fugate said, the agency has already used Twitter as one method to publicize evacuation orders from local officials. At the California meeting, one subject was how, in the event of a natural disaster, Twitter could promote -- essentially, feature -- messages from his agency or official hurricane forecasters that would go to users in affected areas.\u000a\u000a"My sense of it was, as they've grown, they've built this tool and it has this capability, and they're looking at this as another way to support their customers during an emergency," Mr. Fugate said. "They know that there's a need out there, and they want to be able to link them into the official information when there's a disaster."\u000a\u000aFor Twitter's part, there are several upsides to working with a government agency like FEMA, or in helping a politician to use Twitter to better reach constituents.\u000a\u000a"We believe that open exchange of information can have a positive global impact," Mr. Macgillivray said, seeming to echo Google's "Don't be evil" motto. "But the other thing is, the more usefulness people can get out of our service, the more they'll like it, the more they'll come back, the more they'll tell their friends about it, and we do think that government information is really useful."\u000a\u000aHe mentioned Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, who has a Twitter account and recently began responding to his followers, as well as Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, who used Twitter during a recent blizzard to find snowed-in residents, dispatch snow plows and even personally shovel them out.\u000a\u000a"That's the magical moment that's instantly connecting you to something important to you," Mr. Macgillivray said. "Once someone has had that sort of experience on Twitter, they stick around."\u000a\u000aEarly this month, Mr. Sharp traveled to New York to address the Senate Press Secretaries Association's annual conference. Mr. Sharp, who had served as the association's president in 2007 while in Ms. Landrieu's office, was greeted as an old friend. Though he was sick and losing his voice, his presentation -- which walked the group through how to hold an online town-hall-style meeting on Twitter -- was the one that everyone was buzzing about over drinks later.\u000a\u000a"This guy comes in and says, 'I was one of you, I know what you're trying to do, and you're all on this product that will help you and your boss do your jobs better,' " said Steve Wymer, the president of the association. "And he's rattling off why he loves his company and why he took the job and why he thinks Twitter can help people connect and make the world a better place. And everyone is asking for his e-mail."\u005cu00A0

VNew Delhi:  The Supreme Court will take up on Friday Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt's plea seeking review of decision to uphold his conviction under the Arms Act and sentencing him to five years in jail in 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.\u000aA bench of Justices P Sathasivam and BS Chauhan, which had delivered the March 21 verdict, will take up the review plea and will also consider similar pleas made by other six convicts in the case.\u000aThe other six convicts who filed review petitions are Yusuf Mohsin Nulwalla, Khalil Ahmed Sayed Ali Nazir, Mohamed Dawood Yusuf Khan, Shaikh Asif Yusuf, Muzammil Umar Kadri and Mohd Ahmed Shaikh.\u000aA day before the deadline for his surrender ended, the Supreme Court had on April 17 granted the 53-year-old actor four weeks' time to surrender before jail authorities to undergo 42 months remaining sentence in the case.\u000aThe Supreme Court had on March 21 upheld his conviction in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. However, it had reduced the six-year jail-term awarded to him by a designated TADA court in 2006 to five years, ruling out his release on probation saying the "nature" of his offence was "serious".\u000aSanjay Dutt was convicted by the TADA court for illegal possession a 9 mm pistol and an AK-56 rifle which was part of the consignment of weapons and explosives brought to India for coordinated serial blasts that killed 257 people and injured over 700.\u000a

VActor-producer George Clooney criticized the growing influence of hedge fund head Daniel Loeb, a big Sony Corp shareholder who wants the conglomerate to spin off part of its entertainment division.\u000a\u000aClooney said in an interview published Friday by film trade publication Deadline Hollywood that Loeb, the billionaire head of Third Point LLC, was "a hedge fund guy who describes himself as an activist but who knows nothing about our business."\u000a\u000aA spokesperson at Third Point, which has a 6.9 percent stake in Sony Corp, said the company had no comment.\u000a\u000aClooney's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, said the actor had no comments to add to those in the interview about Loeb.\u000a\u000aThe A-list actor's remarks came after Sony Corp CEO Kazuo Hirai said on Thursday that the company was carefully considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment assets, which include movies, television and music.\u000a\u000aClooney co-founded production company Smokehouse Pictures, and signed a production agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2009. The studio will distribute Smokehouse's upcoming film "The Monuments Men," starring Matt Damon.\u000a\u000aSmokehouse was the company behind the 2012 Iran hostage thriller "Argo," which won Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year.\u000a\u000aIn the interview, Clooney accused Loeb of being "a carpetbagger, and one who is trying to spread a climate of fear that pushes studios to want to make only tent poles," referring to high-profile, big budget films.\u000a\u000aDeadline said that Loeb had increased pressure on Sony to spin off its entertainment arm and criticized Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chief executives Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton for the poor box office performances of Sony's big-budget summer films "After Earth" and "White House Down."\u000a\u000a(Also see: Sony hires Morgan Stanley, Citi to gauge spin-off option - report)\u000a\u000aClooney said that Loeb's proposal, based on the underperformance of two films in Sony's large roster of movies, was misguided.\u000a\u000a"If guys like this are given any weight because they've bought stock and suddenly feel they can tell us how to do our business - one he knows nothing about - this does great damage," the actor said.

VLondon: Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover on Wednesday reported its best ever November retail sales of 46,547 vehicles, up 27 per cent as compared to the year-ago period despite a slowdown in China, the world's largest auto market.\u000aThe Coventry-based luxury carmaker sold 437,512 vehicles in the first 11 months of 2015, four per cent up on the same period in the previous year.\u000aRetail sales for the month of November were up 70 per cent in the UK, 68 per cent up in Europe, 52 per cent up in North America and eight per cent up year-on-year in other overseas markets. Retail volumes in China were down 22 per cent for the month, reflecting slowdown in the economy.\u000a"We started the fourth quarter of 2015 with a record October and have followed this up with another historic month of sales, thanks in large part to the performance of the UK and European markets," JLR Group sales operations director Andy Goss said.\u000a"Jaguar has delivered a strong performance with solid growth in the UK and Europe thanks to the new XE. Land Rover has again seen record sales this month with continued strong global demand for the new and refreshed model line-up," he said.\u000aMarking its best November yet, Land Rover retailed 38,555 vehicles in the month, up 26 per cent year-on-year. The best-sellers for the month included the Range Rover Sport, 13 per cent up year-on-year, the Land Rover Discovery, seven per cent up, and the Range Rover, which was 15 per cent up on the previous year.\u000aThe new Discovery Sport also marked a growth in popularity, with retails of 9,358 in the month. Jaguar delivered 7,992 vehicles in the month, up 33 per cent on November 2014.\u000a

VSamsung said Wednesday it would limit recharging of the batteries of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to lower the risk of explosions in a measure apparently intended to jolt users into returning their devices following a recall.\u000a\u000aThe South Korean electronics giant on September 2 suspended sales of its latest flagship smartphone and announced a recall of 2.5 million units already sold, after faulty batteries caused some handsets to explode during charging.\u000a\u000aSamsung announced a software update that will limit battery recharges to 60 percent of capacity in a half-page advert carried by major South Korean newspapers.\u000a\u000a(Also see:\u005cu00A0Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Recall: Company Urges Consumers to Stop Using Smartphone)\u000a\u000aIt would prevent the phones from overheating, and thus exploding, but would effectively mean a downgrade of the high-end device.\u000a\u000a"It is a measure that prioritises consumer safety but we apologise for the inconvenience," the ad said.\u000a\u000aThe automatic update for South Korean users will take place on September 20, a day after Samsung begins to hand out new Note 7 handsets with fault-free batteries.\u000a\u000a(Also see:\u005cu00A0Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Recall: Here's How to Check If Your Unit Is Safe)\u000a\u000aSamsung had advised consumers to trade their handsets for temporary replacement phones provided by the firm until it releases new Note 7s.\u000a\u000aBut many users have snubbed the offer, choosing to wait until the new phones were available, citing the inconvenience of switching devices for an interim period.\u000a\u000aA Samsung spokeswoman said similar safety measures for overseas users were under review.\u000a\u000aSince the global launch of the oversized "phablet" smartphone in August, several users have posted images on social media showing the charred device, saying it suddenly caught fire.\u000a\u000aSamsung said the problem was caused by a faulty battery cell and announced a large-scale recall - the first involving its flagship phone.\u000a\u000aSince then, airlines and aviation agencies around the world including the US and Singapore have warned passengers against using them on flights.\u000a\u000aThe US Consumer Product Safety Commission last week urged Note 7 owners to stop using it.\u000a\u000aThe debacle dealt a major blow to the firm's reputation and will likely hurt profits at a time when it faces a growing challenge from Apple's iPhone in the high-end market and Chinese rivals in the low-end segment.\u000a\u000aThe mobile business accounts for a major share of profits at Samsung, which is the world's largest smartphone maker but also produces home appliances and memory chips.

VMumbai:  A sessions court on Thursday gave the green signal to the CBI to conduct polygraph tests on 12 persons in connection with the murder of RTI activist Satish Shetty. These 12 include an IRB official and five suspects, who were earlier arrested by the local crime branch of the rural police.\u000aShetty was killed on January 13, 2010, near his Talegaon Dabhade home. He had exposed many land scams in the area using the RTI Act.\u000aPolice Inspector Anjir Jadhav from the CBI (Pune) yesterday produced Advocate Vijay Dhabhade, Pramod Waghmode, Navnath Shelar, Dongrya Rathod, Bapu Bhegade, Sagar Khollam, Kishor Aware, Kishor Bhegade, Hanumant Kalokhe, Umesh Phuge, Pradeep Bhalerao and IRB official Jayant Danagre in the court of Additional Sessions Judge S M Shinde and sought permission for the polygraph test on them. The court asked all the 12 if they were ready to face the lie detector, and they replied in the affirmative.\u000a"We produced 12 people, including five accused arrested by the local crime branch of the rural police then, and witnesses in the court and sought permission for polygraph tests on them. The court gave permission," Superintendent of Police (CBI) Vidya Kulkarni said.\u000aJadhav said six of the 12 are witnesses in the case.\u000aCBI sources said the then local crime branch police officials were also on the radar of the CBI as they had twisted the case and created fake witnesses, but Jadhav said it was too early to say anything about any police officers being under the scanner. After the murder, the local crime branch of the Pune rural police had arrested lawyer Dabhade and his clerk Waghmode, besides Rathod, Navnath Shelar and another accused Sham Dabhade. The police had also filed a 400-page chargesheet in the case.\u000a Reward hiked to R 10 lakh\u000a The Anti-Corruption Branch of the CBI, Pune, has enhanced the reward to R 10 lakh from R 5 lakh for any person who gives credible information regarding the people involved in the conspiracy and murder of RTI activist Satish Shetty. The identity of the informant will be kept secret. Information may be sent to the Superintendent of Police, CBI (Anti-Corruption Branch), Akurdi.\u000a

VNew Delhi: The government on Thursday raised Rs. 1,165 crore from the sale of 5 per cent stake in Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor) after retail investors lapped up all the shares reserved for them.\u000aA day after institutional investors put in bids for twice the number of shares on offer, retail investors bid for over 24.59 lakh shares or 1.26 times of the 19.49 lakh shares reserved for them.\u000aThe retail investors portion was oversubscribed even before the close of market, according to stock exchange data.\u000aConcor's is the second disinvestment by the government in just over two weeks but unlike the previous issue, retail participation was robust.\u000aRetail portion in offer for sale (OFS) of NTPC on February 23 remained unsubscribed and the government had made good the deficit by allocating shares to institutional buyers.\u000aThe government came up with the Concor issue as it races to meet the revised, lower target of Rs. 25,000 crore. A 5 per cent additional discount was offered to retail investors, which are those who bid for shares worth not more than Rs. 2 lakh.\u000aThe government sold over 97.48 lakh shares or 5 per cent in Concor at a floor price of Rs. 1,195. Of this, over 77.98 lakh share were offered to institutional investors yesterday.\u000aAt a floor price of Rs. 1,195, sale of over 97.48 lakh shares fetched Rs. 1,165 crore to the exchequer.\u000aWith this, the government has mopped up Rs. 19,517 crore through stake sale in seven PSUs.\u000aInstitutional investors, including FIIs and insurance companies, had given a thumping start to Concor stake sale yesterday with the portion offered to them getting oversubscribed by 2.02 times. Total bids worth Rs. 1,187 crore came in from these buyers.\u000aConcor falls under the administrative control of Railway Ministry and provides logistics support such as inland container depots, domestic container terminals, transportation by rail and road, warehousing, storage and other value-added solutions.\u000aThe government has already sold stake sale in IOC, NTPC, EIL, PFC, REC and Dredging Corp so far this fiscal.\u000aThe government has lowered the disinvestment target for the current fiscal to Rs. 25,000 crore in the revised estimates, from the budgeted Rs. 41,000 crore.\u000a

VNew Delhi:\u000aFinance Minister P Chidambaram today said Enforcement Directorate should be extremely careful while choosing cases for prosecution under the money laundering law and focus its energies on important ones.\u000a"A word of caution is necessary. We must be extremely selective in deciding which cases to prosecute under the money laundering law. Otherwise, we will be overwhelmed with cases that we would be required to prosecute," he said addressing officials of Enforcement Directorate (ED).\u000aStating that money laundering was behind crimes like human and drug trafficking and terror financing, the minister called for greater international cooperation to deal with the menace.\u000a"It is important that agencies across the world cooperate, share technology, share information and chase the offenders," Mr Chidambaram said.\u000aExtending support to the measures taken by ED to come down heavily on violators of foreign exchange laws, the minister said there was a need to strengthen the directorate and fill up the positions lying vacant for long.\u000a"I would like to appeal to the CVC, UPSC and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to please understand the gravity of situation arising out of these vacancies and work harder and quicker to ensure that these vacancies are filled," Mr Chidambaram said.\u000aThe biggest limitation is number of people attached to the department, he said, adding against the sanctioned strength of 2,064, it has in place 660 people, leaving 1,404 vacancies.\u000aElaborating on the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the Minister said: "The PMLA rests on the principle of a predicate crime and when there is an offence which has anything that has to do with proceeds of crime.\u000a"Even if you are acquitted in the trial of a predicate crime, it is possible that you could be convicted of an offence under money laundering," he said.\u000aThe minister further said that theft, breach of trust, misappropriation and cheating could throw up cases of money laundering, but the ED must carefully select the cases for prosecution.\u000a

VSan Francisco: Google-owned YouTube on Tuesday announced it has bought FameBit, a marketplace where video makers can connect with brands interested in sponsoring their creations.\u000aYouTube did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy FameBit, which it described as a technology platform that helps creators and brands make matches leading to sponsorships or paid promotions.\u000a"We believe that Google's relationship with brands and YouTube's partnerships with creators, combined with FameBit's technology and expertise, will help increase the number of branded content opportunities available," YouTube product management vice president Ariel Bardin said in an online post.\u000aThe end goal is to bring more revenue to the community of online video creators that are central to YouTube.\u000aNine years ago YouTube launched a "partner program" designed to help video creators earn advertising money and gain viewers. In the past year, the top 100 advertisers have increased the amount spent on YouTube video ads by 50 percent, according to Bardin.\u000a"As we look to the future, we want even more creators and brands to come together and realize the benefits of these creative collaborations," Bardin said.\u000aSouthern California-based FameBit will continue as a standalone operation for now, co-founders David Kierzkowski and Agnes Kozera said in a message posted on its website.\u000a"With Google's relationship with brands large and small, and YouTube's partnership with creators around the globe, we hope to connect even more brands to creators, engage more audiences, and make brand marketing more creative and authentic than ever," the FameBit co-founders said.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VMaharashtra Navnirman Sena\u000aThe Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) threatened on July 31, 2013 to disrupt the release of the Shah Rukh Khan-Deepika Padukone starrer Chennai Express.\u000aThe party's film unit is upset over reports that the Rohit Shetty-directed movie has demanded prime slots in single cinemas across the state at the expense of some Marathi movies that are being screened.\u000a"If the producers of Chennai Express attempt to dislodge any of the ongoing or forthcoming Marathi movies, we shall not tolerate it and deal with it in MNS style," warned Maharashtra Navnirman Chitrapat Karmachari Sena (film wing) chief Amey Khopkar. \u000a He specifically referred to the hit Marathi movie Duniyadari, running to full houses since July 19, 2013 in single screen cinemas in non-metro cities and small towns.\u000aKhopkar said his party had written to owners of all single cinema halls and other cinemas seeking a commitment they would not take out Duniyadari from their screens to accommodate Chennai Express.\u000a"If the Chennai Express producers attempt to do this, we shall not let the movie be exhibited in cinemas of the state. We shall also remove their publicity posters from Thursday (August 1, 2013)," Khopkar declared.\u000aBased on the best-selling novel of the same title by the late Suhas Shirvalkar, Duniyadari has been a major commercial success with critical acclaim.\u000aWith Swapnil Joshi and Urmila Kanitkar in the lead roles, it shows the journey of a modern affluent youngster's life.\u000a

VMumbai:  Days after slamming senior BJP leader LK Advani for his controversial blog, Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray today backed him on his recent comments which rocked the Parliament. Mr Advani had called the UPA an 'illegitimate' government and had to withdraw the offending word, conceding he had made a mistake.\u000a"The word used by Advani is cent per cent the truth," Bal Thackeray said in his party mouthpiece, Saamna. "There was no need to withdraw it."\u000aThe crux of Mr Advani's speech on Wednesday was that illegal immigration, allegedly encouraged by the Congress for vote-bank politics, is to blame for the violence in Assam that has left more than 70 people dead in the last one month. "Bangladeshis in India should be deported and before that disenfranchised. The PM and Home Minister should set a target for the government and share it with the House," Mr Advani said as he wound up his speech.\u000aMr Thackeray went a step further and said that in his opinion, the UPA-II was illegitimate as the government was using the CBI illegally.\u000aHe also agreed on BJP's views on the situation in Assam. He said, "The Congress considers Bangladeshis as a vote-bank and not as an enemy."\u000aEarlier, Mr Thackeray disagreed with Mr Advani's view that it's possible that a non-Congress, non-BJP Prime Minister heading a government supported by one of these two parties after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. In an editorial in the party's magazine, the Shiv Sena supremo said Mr Advani's blog is inaccurate and demoralizing. He angrily offered to give Mr Advani "a dose of morale and strength."\u000a

VLondon:  A 1,400-piece silver-gilt dinner set commissioned by the former Maharaja of Patiala Bhupinder Singh has fetched a whopping 1.96 million pounds, setting a world record for an English dinner service sold at auction.\u000aThe price paid for the Maharaja's banqueting service, used almost a century ago, is almost double its pre-sale estimate.\u000aThe set was purchased by an anonymous collector, Christie's auction house in London said.\u000aThe opening bid was pegged at 1.3 million pounds, and its estimated value was between 1 million - 1.5 million pounds.\u000aThe nearly 500-kg weighing George V dinner service cutlery was especially commissioned for a visit to Patiala by the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII in 1922 and Duke of Windsor.\u000aDuring the same visit, the Maharaja entertained the Prince with polo matches, pig-sticking and shooting during the day, followed by small dinners and informal dances.\u000aThe dinner service was made by a London company 'Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Company'.\u000aEach piece of the service has a scroll and foliage border above cast and chased panels of animals, separated by cast daggers and variously engraved or cast with coat-of-arms, crown and initials.\u000aThe Maharaja's wealth and status was such that he was the first man in India to own an aircraft, for which the Patiala Aviation Club was founded, Christie's said in a statement.\u000aThe Maharaja was also an avid and early motorcar enthusiast, and a legend has it that he would travel in a motorcade of 20 Rolls Royce's.\u000a

VChefs, restaurateurs, and people I dine with are sometimes surprised by how I remember dishes that I had eaten years ago. As a food writer, you are expected to remember tastes. But why this food memory should go back that far is something even I don\u2019t understand fully. One big reason, however, could be that those of us in the business of decoding food and flavours are perhaps more tuned to eat mindfully. Of course, you do not need to be a food writer to appreciate the benefits of mindful eating. Remembering the flavours of what you are eating may or may not happen, if you pay attention to the bites. What will certainly happen, on the other hand, is better and healthier eating. If you are in the habit of eating a bowl of meal in front of the telly, watching your favourite show, abandon it right away. Take some time out, sit at a table and munch slowly, savouring each flavour and the experience.\u000aAll nutritionists will tell you that one reason why we land up making bad food choices is because of emotional eating. Feeling low: dig into that bag of chips and wine. Feeling bored: hog on instant noodles. Feeling stressed: reach for that bar of chocolate\u2026 All these are examples of not eating mindfully. As is eating on automation\u2014ignoring your body cues, following set patterns and timings and eating when you are not hungry. Or, skipping meals and then eating when you are ravenous. You cannot pay attention to food when your instinct is screaming at you to tank up immediately!\u000aFortunately, with more emphasis on eating well and living well, many of us are gradually moving towards mindful eating. Go to upscale restaurants, and you will realise that consuming habits in India have been changing and the premium is now on quality and not quantity. People, at least those affluent enough to take care of themselves, are now increasingly careful of each morsel they put in.\u000aWhich is also why we have those sundry fads dominating the business of food and restaurants: superfoods like quinoa, goji berries, chia seeds, spirulina, and seaweed have busted the charts in global popularity. And while you may have started on some of these, mindful eating also means that you relook at your foods and where they are sourced from; ingredients that notch up the carbon miles may not be a great idea. Go local.\u000aConsumers mindlessly following food fads is one of my favourite bug bears. Why can\u2019t we apply ourselves a little more, not follow the herd and think of healthy local ingredients the mandi near your house may stock? The larger point about healthy eating is consuming fresh food, grown and sourced in healthy, non-harmful ways. And the many local, seasonal Indian ingredients offer us enough of a choice to be able to do this.\u000aIf quinoa is gluten free, so is buckwheat flour. Kuttu ka atta, the flour many Indian homes have traditionally used as vrat ka khana, fasting food, is an easy, inexpensive and local alternative that you can apply without paying an arm and limb for a fad-driven diet. It does not perhaps have the \u201ccomplete plant protein\u201d like quinoa. But a plate of beans can give you an equal quantity of that protein. Millets that are found everywhere and inexpensively in the country (but have lost their popularity to wheat) are also gluten free and can be cooked in exactly similar ways as quinoa.\u000aSimilarly, kale and goji berries may be fashionable but instead of paying those huge mark-ups to food marketers, why should we not choose local, seasonal strawberries that are also packed with phytochemicals, and simple palak, spinach greens to be part of our daily diets? Traditional practices of cooking with only seasonal ingredients in Indian kitchens or consuming only seasonal fruit ensured a balanced and nutritious diet round the year. Eating guavas and oranges in winter, melons and mangoes in summer, singhada in the monsoon are all instances of mindful eating that we need to get back to.\u000aLocal gastronomy is a big trend in the world of gourmet dining. But what the champions of \u201cCalifornian\u201d style food, or Noma tourists tend to forget is that all these \u201chigh cuisines\u201d are based on front-footing local ingredients. Having arctic ants and foraged foods on fancy plates may be utterly chic. But the chic-ness is firmly rooted in a philosophy of food that takes pride in the local context: instead of importing lemon from southern Italy, use arctic ants to give the same flavour!\u000aCooking fresh food in the kitchen instead of relying on processed foods is also a healthy traditional practice that we need to go back to. Cooking up MasterChef inspired dishes may be a new fad in metropolitan India and if you are an inventive cook, you may want to rustle up some of those dishes for your parties. But simple, home-style dishes have their own virtues. The spices that we used with particular vegetables, the many cooking oils of each region flavourful and nutritious in different ways, slow cooking techniques\u2026 all the ways in which our families cooked before the globalisation of the palate began changing our ways of eating were particularly attuned to our bodies and minds. To be cognizant of these is mindful eating too. And healthy.\u000aAbout the Author: Anoothi Vishal is a columnist and writes on food for The Economic Times and NDTV Food, and runs the blog amoveablefeast.in.

VIn this candid Walk the Talk, Stephen Hadley, Former US National Security Advisor recollects his first visit to India in 1972 and how it has changed now to become one mighty country. He says how all the three US governments viz the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations have developed strong ties with India. But he also says that a strong US-India tie might not be able to forced Pakistan to crackdown on terror. He also says that India has major stake in peace and security in Afghanistan and India should help them in their transition. Mr Hadley believes that India and Pakistan must find ways to reduce the growing tension between them and he also appreciates Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to attend the SAARC summit.\u000aComments\u000aSign in using or\u000aLoading...\u000aTo subscribe to email notification for comments, please add your email address.\u000aEmail\u000aName Email\u000aPost to FacebookPost to Twitter\u000a SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

VBangalore:  Chief Minister DV Sadananda Gowda said that the state is not in a position to release water to Andhra Pradesh from Narayanpur dam because of the drought situation in the state.\u000a"When the state is reeling under severe drought, how is it possible to release water to Andhra Pradesh? We have already clarified our stand in this matter and Andhra Pradesh should understand our real difficulties",Chief Minister DV Sadananda Gowda told reporters on Tuesday at Inchageri village.\u000aMr Gowda said that the government was seriously contemplating waiving farmers' loans. "We are studying drought situation in detail and will soon take a decision on the matter," he said.\u000aThe Chief Minister said that the government has so far spent over 400 crore rupees on the drought relief work. Three teams comprising of 15 ministers would visit the drought hit areas every 15 days to monitor relief work and report the situation to him, he said.\u000aMr Gowda said crop worth R 4,248 crore had been lost due to drought and the government has already sought relief from the Centre.\u000aHe said that Karnataka expected Maharashtra to release two thousand million cubic feet of water soon to tide over the water scarcity in some drought hit districts.\u000a

VEmirates will be using flexible routes, which can vary by day, taking advantage of tail winds and avoiding head winds to reduce the time in the air.\u000aWellington, New Zealand:  An Emirates Airbus A380 touched down in New Zealand today, completing what is believed to be the world's longest non-stop scheduled commercial flight.\u000aThe service from Dubai to Auckland covered 14,200 kilometres (8,824 miles), according to industry website airwaysnews.com, pipping Qantas' 13,800-kilometre Sydney-Dallas route launched in 2014.\u000aIt said the route was also the longest in duration, with passengers set to spend 17 hours 15 minutes in the air during the return leg from Auckland to Dubai.\u000aHowever, that record is expected to be short-lived because Emirates' upcoming Dubai-Panama City service will take 17 hours 35 minutes when it launches later this month.\u000aEmirates described it as "one of the longest air routes in the world by distance".\u000a"But with the assistance of clever technology and good planning, passengers will get to their destination in the shortest possible time," it said.\u000a"Emirates will be using flexible routes, which can vary by day, taking advantage of tail winds and avoiding head winds to reduce the time in the air."\u000aThe inaugural Dubai-Auckland flight was made by an A380 but the regular service will be carried out using the Boeing 777.\u000aNew Zealand Transport Minister Simon Bridges said the non-stop service, which cuts three hours off current Dubai-Auckland travel times, improved New Zealand's connectivity to the rest of the world.\u000a"Direct flights will encourage even more trade and tourism between our two countries, by offering more choice to passengers and freight customers," he said.\u000a

VSatyendar Jain said I-T department's move was to turn him into "victim of vendetta politics".\u000aNew Delhi:  Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain appeared before the Income Tax Department on Tuesday which questioned him for over three hours at the Central Revenue Building in connection with a tax evasion probe against certain Kolkata-based firms.\u000aAfterwards, Mr Jain slammed the I-T department's move to summon him as "a witness" and said he was the Centre's "latest victim of vendetta politics".\u000aHe said the allegations against him do not hold water as he had made all the necessary disclosures in his I-T returns and election affidavits.\u000a"It is a conspiracy to malign my political career," Mr Jain told reporters in a press conference at the Aam Aadmi Party office after his appearance, that lasted from around 12 noon to a little over 3 pm.\u000aAAP leader Sanjay Singh termed Jain's summoning as "harassment" and emphasised the party and the government "stand by him".\u000aThe I-T department had last month asked Mr Jain, a key member of the AAP Cabinet, to appear before the Investigating Officer of the case on October 4 and furnish personal financial details and ITRs for the last four years.\u000aMr Jain, who worked as an architect before joining politics, arrived at the I P Estate office accompanied by party leaders Mr Singh and Ashutosh around 12 noon.\u000aThe I-T department had reportedly recovered documents relating to some transactions being made by at least three Kolkata-based firms and had a link to Jain.\u000aHe said the investments in the three firms were done when he was still in architecture.\u000aHe said at present, he is neither a director nor a shareholder in these companies and has no connection with them since July 2013.\u000a"They failed to answer as to why I was summoned. They are projecting me as a hawala trader. I wonder whether the media prepared the questions I was asked by the I-T department or vice-versa. I was surprised when they asked me about persons whom I never met and spoke to in my entire life," he said.\u000aHowever, the day had its share of drama in the form of a slipper attack against Mr Jain, Mr Singh and Ashutosh just as they were leaving the I-T office.\u000aBhavana Arora, who had staged an ink attack on Mr Kejriwal in January, hurled a slipper at the AAP leaders which hit their car. She was upset over Mr Kejriwal's remarks on cross-LoC anti-terror surgical strikes by the army.\u000aThe I-T department officials had claimed they have received records of certain financial transactions connected to Mr Jain after their counterparts in Kolkata recently searched a firm in connection with a tax evasion and alleged illegal financial remittances case.\u000a

VSeveral countries have vowed to open tax evasion investigations following the leak of 11.5 million confidential documents in the Panama Papers scandal.\u000aTunis, Tunisia:  Inkyfada, an electronic magazine investigating Tunisian involvement in the so-called Panama Papers, came under attack by hackers on Tuesday just hours after its first postings on the scandal.\u000a"Our site has come under a serious IT attack. The hackers have managed to post false information under our name," it said on Twitter, adding that it was being temporarily taken offline.\u000aMonia Ben Hamadi, editorial chief of Inkyfada, told AFP that the false reports had been identified but not the hackers. "The attack was orchestrated from several places," she said.\u000aReporters Without Borders (RSF), in a statement, condemned the cyber-attack which it said showed "how investigative journalism still causes fear" in Tunisia following its 2011 revolution.\u000aSeveral countries have vowed to open tax evasion investigations following the leak of 11.5 million confidential documents in the Panama Papers scandal.\u000aThe vast stash from Panamanian legal firm Mossack Fonseca was obtained from an anonymous source by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with more than 100 media groups by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which published their first findings on Sunday.\u000a

VThe garden has over 40 different colours of tulips and the department is now planting different variants.\u000aSrinagar:  There is early bloom in Asia's largest tulip garden in Srinagar. With 10 Lakh tulip bulbs spread over 30 acres, the garden will be open to public next week, nearly three weeks ahead of schedule.\u000aThis year, climatic conditions have been favourable to tulips, leading to early bloom.\u000a"This will prepone the tourist season and it will be a great benefit to tourism industry," said Talat Parvez, director gardens and floriculture.\u000aLast year, the garden was opened in the first week of April as March witnessed heavy snowfall, but this year the temperature is 10 degrees above normal.\u000a"We tend to tulip buds more carefully than our children. We feel very happy they are blooming. It's our livelihood," said Abdul Jabbar, a gardener.\u000aThe garden has over 40 different colours of tulips and the department is now planting different variants to make the garden attractive beyond the tulip season.\u000a"Once this bloom goes in April ending we will have another bloom of Lilian in full swing, subsequently a bloom in July and August," said Mr Parvez.\u000aOfficials say garden will be formally thrown open to public in next three to four days.\u000a

VWindows Phone users, who have been missing a notification centre, might soon be relieved, if an image of the incoming Windows Phone 8.1 is true.\u000a\u000aWMPoweruser has posted an image showing the purported lockscreen settings of the upcoming revamped version of the Windows Phone operating system, Windows Phone 8.1.\u000a\u000aThe purported image of the Windows Phone 8.1 shows notification customisation settings that include up to four quick access settings. The leaked image also reveals a new turn on/off notification feature for apps, which will reportedly not disable the Live Tiles functionality of the app on the device. In addition, the leaked image also shows a banner notification for the Windows Phone, although it does not detail the functionality. The leaked image also includes icons for Wi-Fi Hot spot, brightness, Wi-Fi and airplane mode.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the purportedly leaked image of the Windows Phone 8.1 notification customisation settings is blurred and not all features are visible.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, a report revealed that Microsoft would ship its upcoming Windows Phone 8.1 with two new features - a notification centre that can be accessed by swiping down from top of the screen, just like Android and iOS, apart from a voice-based assistant believed to be codenamed 'Cortana'.\u000a\u000aThe report suggested that Microsoft intends to replace the existing Bing Search on Windows Phone devices to offer voice or text input interactions. The Verge claims that the rumoured voice-based assistant 'Cortana' will be similar to Apple Siri technology and Google Now, and can learn location context from the Windows Phone device.\u000a\u000aThe report noted that the Redmond giant has been testing copies of Windows Phone 8.1 internally and plans to unveil the rumoured Windows Phone upgrade at Build Developer Conference in April next year.

VRice flour, also called rice powder, is a form of flour made from finely milled rice. During the milling process, grinding flour is one way to make use of any damaged or broken grains which can't be used as they are. Production of this flour may include both white or brown rice grains and it can be used for all kinds of baked goods.\u000aRice flour and rice starch are two different things. Rice starch is produced by steeping rice in Iye. Rice flour, on the other hand, is the ground version of the rice itself, as mentioned above. Rice flour is a staple food in Southeast Asia, Japan and India.\u000aHealth Benefits of Rice Flour\u000aDid you know that rice flour is full of health benefits? That is right, it is high in protein and vitamins (note that flour from brown rice contains a higher level of B vitamins). The primary difference between brown and white rice is the husk. During milling, the removal of the husk produces white rice. However, the husk of brown rice is left intact, making it more nutritious and a good selection when considering fiber, vitamins and nutrients such as calcium and zinc.\u000aThe best thing about rice flour is that it is easily available and is inexpensive. It has all the qualities of wheat flour that we are so used to. It binds well, tastes good and is so easy to use. In terms of nutritional content, rice flour isn't very short of wheat flour. It is just slightly higher in calorie content.\u000aBetween both brown rice and white rice flour, I prefer to use brown rice flour and mill the flour in my exclusively 100% gluten free kitchen. Remember milling the flour is a process that should be done in an exclusive facility otherwise it will be full of cross contamination.\u000aHow to cook with Rice Flour\u000aRice flour makes excellent pasta, cookies and cakes. It also makes excellent rotis. No, it's true. Gluten free fresh pasta is the best thing to make. It is so easy and requires very few ingredients.\u000aRecipe Gluten Free Fresh Pasta:\u000aIngredients:\u000a1 1/2 cup Brown Rice Flour\u000a1/2 cup Potato Starch\u000a2 tsp Xanthum Gum\u000a1tsp Salt\u000a4 Eggs\u000aMethod:\u000a- Whisk the brown rice flour, potato starch, xanthum gum and salt.\u000a- Whisk the eggs in a bowl. It's always better to do this in a separate bowl than putting eggs straight into a mixer to avoid bad eggs. This also makes the dough more airy.\u000a- In a free standing mixer, blend the flour mixture and eggs. Remember gluten free flour should not be mixed with a dough hook as it lacks the protein and can become too stiff.\u000aThis process can be done by hand too, like a roti atta.\u000a- Make small balls out of the dough. At this point you might need to add oil as the liquid could be less from the eggs at times.\u000a- How do you make the pasta out of these balls? You could either use pasta making machines or simply roll the pasta dough balls and make thin strips.\u000a- Boil the pasta with water and salt. Use the same day.\u000aRecipe: Gluten Free Cheesy Hearts\u000aIngredients:\u000a100gms Cheddar Cheese (grated finely)\u000a50gms Brown Rice Flour\u000a1/4tsp Baking Powder\u000a1tbsp Chia Seeds soaked in water till they bloom\u000aMethod:\u000a- Preheat the oven to 200 degree C.\u000a- Place on the ingredients in a bowl and use your hands to bind them into a dough.\u000a- Flatten the dough between two cling films and place in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.\u000a- Remove the dough from the refrigerator and immediately cut with a metal cookie cutter.\u000a- Prepare baking sheet and place them on it. Bake for 10-12 minutes.\u000a

VYouTube is set to announce within a few weeks a series of channels that will require payment, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\u000a\u000aThe content on the new pay channels will be in addition to the millions of videos viewers watch for free on YouTube. It's not clear whether the paid videos will come with advertising.\u000a\u000aThe person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe Financial Times reported earlier that viewers would be charged as little as $1.99 a month for subscriptions.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, YouTube said it is looking into creating a "subscription platform" that provides its partners with a way to generate revenue beyond video rentals and placing ads in and around content. It said, however, that it had "nothing to announce at this time."\u000a\u000aExecutives hinted at the coming pay channels at a preview event in March ahead of a meeting in New York with advertisers.\u000a\u000aSuch a model could help video producers make money from niche audiences. That's different from how YouTube works now, where the most popular videos, like PSY's "Gangnam Style" music video, make the most money from advertising.\u000a\u000aOne example given by executives was of video lessons by a computer science teacher.\u000a\u000a"For people who create great value but for only a narrow interest group, I think that the potential for pay channels unlocks opportunities for creating revenue streams," said Lucas Watson, YouTube's vice president of sales and marketing, at the time.\u000a\u000aIntroducing pay channels would also accustom fans of YouTube to paying for content, something the site is not known for, although it has sold and rented movies and TV shows from major studios since late 2008.\u000a\u000a"It's a whole new skill set to develop: to convince people to actually take out their credit card, even for one cent," said Robert Kyncl, YouTube's vice president and global head of content partnerships, told reporters at the March event.\u000a\u000aGoogle bought YouTube for $1.76 billion in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50 million users worldwide. Today, the site boasts more than 1 billion visitors a month.

VSocial networking site Facebook will introduce a payment system 'Facebook Credits' for Indian users on July 1. The virtual currency can be spent across various games or applications they use on the popular website.\u000a\u000a"Facebook will introduce a new payment system Facebook Credits in India from July 1," a company spokesperson told PTI.\u000a\u000aFacebook Credits enables fast and easy transactions across games on the social networking site and will benefit about 2.5 crore Facebook subscribers in the country.\u000a\u000aThe users will be able to enter their payment information once and can buy, earn and spend safely across various games or applications they use on Facebook.\u000a\u000a"Starting July 1, we will require all social game developers on the Facebook canvas platform to process payments through Facebook Credits," Facebook Platform Marketing Manager Deb Liu wrote on the company's official blog in January.\u000a\u000aThis will also help various brands, which use the medium of Facebook to retail them goods through their social pages.\u000a\u000a"Facebook Credits is currently used in more than 350 applications from 150 developers, representing more than 70 per cent of virtual goods transactions volume on Facebook," Liu had said.\u000a\u000aFacebook Credits would also offer incentives such as early access to product features, premium promotions on Facebook, premium targeting for ads, and access to new co-promotion opportunities.\u000a\u000aMany developers such as Zynga, Playfish, CrowdStar, Digital Chocolate, PopCap and Arkadium have already adopted Facebook Credits for in-game virtual goods.

VA Google logo is seen at the entrance to the company's offices in Toronto September 5, 2013.\u000aConsumer rights law firm Hagens Berman said it filed a nationwide antitrust class-action lawsuit against Google Inc alleging the company "illegally monopolized" the Internet and mobile search market in the United States.\u000aThe lawsuit alleges that Google has expanded its monopoly of the internet search market by pre-loading its applications onto Android mobile devices through its Mobile Application Distribution Agreements.\u000aAccording to the lawsuit, Google's role in placing this suite of apps, including Google Play and YouTube, has hampered the market and kept the price of devices made by competing manufactures like Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp artificially high.\u000a"It's clear that Google has not achieved this monopoly through offering a better search engine, but through its strategic, anti-competitive placement, and it doesn't take a forensic economist to see that this is evidence of market manipulation," said Steve Berman, the attorney representing consumers.\u000aGoogle representatives were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.\u000aThe case is in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\u000a

Banning the railways for train accidents, buses for bus accidents and taxis is not correct," Gadkari said outside Parliament House in New Delhi.\u000a\u000aThe minister's statement came a day after Delhi government banned all operations by private cab service Uber with immediate effect and blacklisted it from providing any transport service in the national capital following the alleged rape committed by a driver registered with it.\u000a\u000aAsked specifically about Delhi government's move, the Union minister said that state governments have the right to take a decision in such matters.\u000a\u000a"It is up to the state government to decide because the subject is in Concurrent List. State governments have equal right to take a decision about it," he said.\u000a\u000aSaying that new systems with modern concepts must be encouraged Gadkari, however, noted that lacunae in such systems should be plugged.\u000a\u000aCiting data that 30 percent of driving licences in the country were bogus, the minister said that a new system would be put in place to replace the Motor Vehicles Act.\u000a\u000a"As per a report, 30 percent of the driving licences in the country are bogus... We are going to change the 1988 Motor Vehicles Act by which we will have a centre comprising all records of drivers. That would help solve the problem of accessing the accident and criminal records of drivers," he said.

VHyderabad:  Andhra Pradesh's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Monday filed a charge sheet in the cash-for-bail case involving former Karnataka minister and mining baron Gali Janardhana Reddy.\u000aSuspended CBI judge T Pattabhirama Rao and retired judge TV Chalapathi Rao are among eight accused figured in the 40-page charge sheet submitted to the ACB court.\u000aJanardhana Reddy's brother Gali Somasekhara Reddy, Suresh Babu - both legislators in Karnataka, Babu's relative Dasaradharami Reddy, Pattabhirama Rao's son Ravichandra, a Yadagiri Rao and a junior lawyer Aditya are the other accused named in the charge sheet.\u000aPattabhirama Rao had granted bail to Janardhana Reddy in illegal mining case for a huge bribe in May this year. The investigations by the ACB revealed that Janardhana Reddy's relatives paid R 10 crore to the judge and the other accused.\u000aAll the eight accused named in the charge sheet have already been arrested by the ACB and they are all lodged in Cherlapally Jail here.\u000aThe ACB submitted to the court the statements by 50 witnesses in the case. The accused have been charged under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.\u000aThe Andhra Pradesh High Court had suspended Pattabhirama Rao after preliminary probe by the CBI established that he received the bribe.\u000aThe ACB, which subsequently took up investigations, also booked a separate case against three accused including two judges for trying to bribe the CBI judge.\u000aChief judge of city small causes court K. Lakshmi Narasimha Rao, district and sessions judge D. Prabhakar Rao and realtor Ravi Surya Prakash Babu are also in jail on charges of approaching Pattabhirama Rao with the bribe offer on behalf of Janardhana Reddy's family.\u000aPattabhirama Rao had rejected the offer but later accepted the one which came through his friend Chalapathi Rao.\u000a

VAuthorities have released few details about the attackers or their motives (AFP Photo)\u000aYangon, Myanmar:  Twelve people have died in the north of Myanmar's Rakhine state in clashes between armed men and troops, state media reported Wednesday, in a sharp escalation of violence in the restive region.\u000aFour soldiers and one attacker were killed on Tuesday when hundreds of men wielding pistols and swords assailed troops in Pyaungpit, Maungdaw township, an area populated mainly by Muslim Rohingya.\u000aTroops also gave a toll of seven dead after fighting in the nearby village of Taung Paing Nyar, updating an earlier figure.\u000a"After the incident, troops found seven dead bodies," the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar reported.\u000a"Swords and sticks were found with the bodies."\u000a The military has been scouring the region, not far from the border with Bangladesh, after nine police officers were killed on Sunday in coordinated attacks on three border posts.\u000aThe unrest has raised the spectre of a repeat of 2012, when sectarian violence ripped through Rakhine, killing more than 100 people and driving tens of thousands of Rohingya into displacement camps.\u000aRohingya both in and outside the squalid camps face severe restrictions on their movement and access to basic services, with rights groups calling them one of the world's most persecuted peoples.\u000aBuddhist nationalists have sought to brand the group as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite many tracing their lineage in Myanmar back generations.\u000aA total of six suspects behind the border attacks -- including four who were captured on Tuesday -- are being held by authorities, according to state media.\u000aAuthorities have released few details about the attackers or their motives, with some blaming the Rohingya, while others have pointed the finger at Bangladeshi groups.\u000aThe clashes mark a dramatic escalation of violence in the region, which has simmered with tension ever since the 2012 unrest that effectively left the state divided along religious lines.\u000aThe UN's special advisor on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar, urged troops and residents to exercise restraint at what he termed a "delicate juncture" for the state.\u000aHe also called on civilians to "not be provoked into any kind of response by targeting other communities or religious groups".\u000aRumours of killings and mass arrests around Maungdaw have spread like wildfire on social media, stoking fear, but details have proved difficult to confirm in the remote and tightly controlled area.\u000a Locals told AFP they were too scared to leave their houses as troops patrolled the streets.\u000aActivists have warned the search for the attackers is being used as a pretext for a crackdown on the Rohingya.\u000aMyanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has come under heavy international pressure to carve out a solution for the Rohingya, whose plight has left a dark stain on the country's promising democratic gains.\u000aShe recently appointed a commission, headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan, to find ways to heal wounds in the bitterly divided and poor state.\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VNew York: US stocks rose on Thursday as upbeat retail sales figures and other US data pointed to a strengthening economy and lifted optimism about consumer spending.\u000aIndexes ended well off their highs for the day, however, paring gains late in the session as US crude oil fell below $60 a barrel for the first time in five years.\u000aThe gains came after the S&P 500 shed 2.4 per cent over the previous three sessions, the worst run for the benchmark index in two months, as weak oil prices weighed on the energy sector.\u000aStill, lower oil prices likely encouraged consumer holiday spending, and November retail sales beat expectations. Retailers were among the day's biggest percentage gainers on the S&P 500, including Urban Outfitters, up 7.6 per cent at $32.29. The S&P retail index jumped 1 per cent.\u000a"It suggests overall spending is going to do well," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. He said a year-end rally could take the S&P to about 2,100.\u000aOther economic data showed a strengthening labor market, as weekly initial jobless claims dipped.\u000aThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.19 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 17,596.34, the S&P 500 gained 9.19 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 2,035.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.14 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 4,708.16.\u000aThe S&P energy sector, which is down 14.7 per cent for the year so far, pared gains late in the session to close flat. Oil prices are down more than 40 percent from June highs.\u000aAdding to investor concern, the fate of a $1.1 trillion US spending bill was put in doubt by Democratic objections over a provision to roll back part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Current spending authority for federal agencies expires at midnight.\u000aStaples Inc jumped 8.7 per cent to $16.10 and Office Depot climbed 12.1 per cent to $7.54 after activist investor Starboard Value LP disclosed stakes in both office-supply retailers.\u000aAbout 7.2 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the 6.9 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.\u000aNYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,787 to 1,295, for a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,668 issues rose and 1,089 fell, for a 1.53-to-1 ratio.\u000aThe S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 15 lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 93 lows.\u000aAfter the bell, shares of Adobe Systems Inc rose 7.2 per cent to $74.75. It said it would buy stock photography company Fotolia and reported quarterly revenue above market estimates.\u000aCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\u000a

VQualcomm has announced its new 64-bit mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 410, which is targeted at entry-level smartphones.\u000a\u000aAs per Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 410 processor can be expected to go under sampling in the first half of 2014 and will likely be in commercial devices by the second half of 2014.\u000a\u000aThe latest Snapdragon 410 processors are manufactured using 28nm process technology and feature processors that are 64-bit capable along with the Adreno 306 GPU, full-HD video playback and supports for up to a 13-megapixel camera.\u000a\u000aThe company notes in a press release, "The delivery of faster connections is important to the growth and adoption of smartphones in emerging regions, and Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets are poised to address the needs of consumers as 4G LTE begins to ramp in China."\u000a\u000aFurther, the Snapdragon 410 chipsets feature integrated 4G LTE and also support 3G connectivity, apart from support modes for dual-SIM or even triple SIM.\u000a\u000aOther features of the Snapdragon 410 chipsets include integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM, NFC functionality, and support for all major navigation constellations (GPS, GLONASS, and China's new BeiDou). The Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset supports Android, Windows Phone and Firefox operating systems.\u000a\u000aCommenting on the announcement Jeff Lorbeck, senior vice president and chief operating officer, Qualcomm Technologies, China said, "We are excited to bring 4G LTE to highly affordable smartphones at a sub-$150 price point with the introduction of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The Snapdragon 410 chipset will also be the first of many 64-bit capable processors as Qualcomm Technologies helps lead the transition of the mobile ecosystem to 64-bit processing."\u000a\u000aNotably, Apple seems to have started the trend towards 64-bit processors in mobile devices, with the iPhone 5s and its custom Apple A7 SoC. Samsung followed suit after, with an announcement that it's next-generation flagship would also sport a 64-bit processor.\u000a\u000aRecently, Qualcomm unveiled its next generation of Snapdragon 800 tier mobile processors, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805.\u000a\u000aThe new Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chipset features a Krait 450 quad-core CPU, which the company claims is the first mobile CPU to run at speeds of up to 2.5GHz per core. The Snapdragon 805 also features the Adreno 420 GPU, which according to Qualcomm delivers 40 percent more graphics processing power than the GPU on the Snapdragon 800.

VAlgiers:  A military transport plane carrying relatives of members of the armed forces crashed in eastern Algeria on Tuesday, killing 103 people, the private Ennahar TV station reported, citing "informed sources".\u000aThe plane crashed in a mountainous area in the Oum El Bouaghi province, about 500 km (300 miles) from the capital Algiers, the report said.\u000aA senior military official told the official APS news agency that 99 passengers and four crew members had been on board the plane, but that the death toll was "yet to be determined".\u000aColonel Lahmadi Bouguern also said that bad weather and gusty winds were probably the cause of the crash.\u000aThe transport plane took off from Algeria's southern Tamanrasset province and was bound for the eastern city of Constantine, APS said.\u000aTuesday's plane crash would be the worst in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Tamanrasset, killing 102 people.\u000a

VWashington:  A top US official was heading to Cairo on Sunday for talks with interim government leaders, the first high-ranking administration member to visit Egypt since the ouster of Mohamed Morsi.\u000aUnder Secretary of State Bill Burns will visit Egypt from Sunday to Tuesday, the State Department said, adding that he would "underscore US support for the Egyptian people."\u000aThe news came as caretaker premier Hazem al-Beblawi resumed talks on forming his cabinet, 11 days after Morsi was ousted in a July 3 military coup amid massive protests against his year-long rule.\u000aProminent liberal leader Mohamed ElBaradei, who assisted in the talks Beblawi began a day earlier with ministerial candidates, was Sunday sworn in as interim vice president for foreign relations, the presidency said.\u000aIn a brief statement, the State Department said Burns would "meet with interim government officials as well as civil society and business leaders.\u000a"In all these meetings, he will underscore US support for the Egyptian people, an end to all violence, and a transition leading to an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government."\u000aOn Friday, the US for the first time called for Morsi's release, and again condemned a wave of arbitrary arrests of members of his Muslim Brotherhood.\u000aBut since the July 3 ouster, Washington has struggled to define whether Egypt's first democratically elected president was the victim of a coup, which would legally force a freeze on some $1.5 billion in vital military and economic US assistance to Cairo.\u000a

VFinance Minister P. Chidambaram today addressed a gathering at the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association in New delhi, a day after the RBI took steps to support the rupee.\u000aThe minister stressed on the need to improve manufacturing and infrastructure in the country, and asked investors to choose ventures they think will do well and invest in them.\u000aHere are the highlights:\u000a Fiscal deficit will remain below 4.8 per cent of GDP\u000a Inflation will moderate. But I can't promise zero inflation\u000a As we produce more power and coal, and reduce dependence on imported commodities, then I think we can control inflation\u000a Current account deficit looms large. We are doing our sums and I am confident that we can control CAD to below last year's CAD. We will finance it fully and safely without running down reserves.\u000a I believe the long-term investor continues to pose faith in the Indian economy.\u000a We need to grow both our infrastructure and manufacturing sectors\u000a India has to become a manufacturing country\u000a We need new products, new designs and new users for these products\u000a

To separate is so costly and scary and, in this case, she has given up her career for her family, and now she is going back to work, but can she really support the children on her own? It must be devastating," Sarah said

VJaipur:  The Jaipur collector has ordered an inquiry in an incident where minor children were asked to donate blood in a camp. Out of four children who took seiously ill, three are better another child's condition is stable.\u000aAnil Sharma, 15, is unconscious in hospital. He collapsed at his school in Jaipur's Chomu village on Thursday.\u000aAnil was among 50 students of Class 11 and 12 who were allowed to donate blood during an interval at a hospital nearby. It's illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to do this. But the blood camp was organized by the local Congress MLA to commemorate the birthday of former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi.\u000aThe politician wanted a large turn-out at his blood donation camp, so he allegedly broke the law.\u000aAnil's father says, "My son told them that he is only 15, but they entered his age as 19. He even told them that he had suffered from jaundice recently, but they ignored it and took his blood."\u000aFour other students are seriously ill. Among the others was Shubham, who says her classmates were bribed into participating: "I told them my age is only 16. But they said that even 14 year olds now donate blood. They said we will give you a certificate, food and also money for donating blood."\u000aThe politician says the problem was created by the hospital, not him: "We took all precautions but if some minors came, it's the doctors who should be blamed. Why did they permit minors ?"\u000aAnil Sharma's family just wants the blame game to end with someone explaining why their teenager's life was risked, apparently in a case of extreme political sycophancy.\u000a

VAll India Students Association (AISA) members during their Occupy UGC march against the government policies on higher education, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)\u000aNew Delhi:  Students from universities across the country camping outside the UGC office for the last 45 days against scrapping of non-NET fellowships today marched to the Parliament to raise their issue but were stopped midway. According to police officials, 150 students were detained and police had to resort to water cannon and tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.\u000aThe students from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia, Ambedkar University, Allahabad University, Jadavpur University, Aligarh Muslim University, Haryana University, Panjab University, among others, today participated in the "national mobilisation call" demanding that their suggestions be considered.\u000aThe students also registered their protest against proposed negotiations on higher education at the forthcoming WTO conference in Nairobi.\u000a"We have been sitting on protest since 45 days but government has neither tried to have a conversation with us nor they have paid any heed to our demands. We are dispersed from here every now and then by police and now when we tried to march to the Parliament we were beaten up by police," said Sunny Kumar, one of the protesters.\u000aPraveen, a protester from JNU alleged, "many of us were beaten by police and injured despite our attempts to peacefully conduct a march".\u000aPolice officials, however, said that the students pelted stones at police prompting them to use water canons.\u000a"Students started pelting stones at police deployed there following which we had use water canons and tear gas shells," a senior police official said.\u000aUGC had in October resolved to discontinue the scheme of non-National Eligibility Test (NET) fellowship, which is provided to those undertaking research in Central universities across India, in a meeting held on October 7, citing shortage of resources.\u000a

VJaved Jaffrey was part of Boogie Woogie - one of India?s longest running dance reality shows\u000aThe Rs.370 billion (about $6.05 bn) Indian television industry offers a plethora of opportunities to every talent and allows each to nurture its skills, says Javed Jaffrey, who associated himself with the small screen through Boogie Woogie, one of the longest running dance reality shows.\u000a"TV has opened the gates. Earlier it was only restricted to films," Javed said.\u000a"Some good talent was just hanging around and waiting for someone to spot them and TV gave them the spotlight. Actors got this platform, which is so great, and could accommodate anyone," added the son of Bollywood's popular comedian Jagdeep. \u000a Javed, who teamed up with Suchitra Krishnamoorthi in Kash-m-Kash later restricted himself to non-fiction shows.\u000a"I made up my mind that I will do fiction in films and non-fiction in TV. I was hosting and doing shows like Boogie Woogie. I have done eight shows on TV which were all non-fiction, which is not much.\u000a"When fiction started on TV, the daily soap splurge happened and I knew that I would not get caught in a daily soap," said the 49-year-old.\u000aCurrently he is giving voiceover to the TV show Ninja Warriors.\u000aJaved, who wears many hats, is now open to do fiction shows as long as it is a "once-a- week" type of role.\u000a"I don't mind doing something like a once a week pivotal character. If there is something interesting where you are playing the lead and is something different, I would love to take it up," said the actor, comedian, choreographer, and producer.\u000aThe television industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18 percent over 2012-17, to reach Rs.848 billion in 2017, according to FICCI-KPMG Indian Media and Entertainment Industry Report 2013. And Javed feels growth has made competition tougher.\u000a"There is more competition now, but by the grace of god, we have managed to stay afloat," he said.\u000a"I always look for reinventing myself...doing something different and new. I term myself as an entertainer. Be it acting in movies, hosting, singing a song, and dancing. I keep myself from rusting," he added.\u000aOn the big screen, Javed did character roles in Singh Is Kinng, Salaam Namaste and Lafangey Parindey among others.\u000a"People feel that there is a lead actor and a character actor. This is wrong; every actor is a character. I like playing principal roles; this is why I don't take up too many films," said Javed who has produced two National Award-winning documentaries, Inshallah, Kashmir and Inshallah Football.\u000a"I enjoy acting. I like to be choosy. I like to see what I can bring to the table. I have to see how I can extend that parameter of the character, which I have been given. You have to go beyond that and bring a dimension and contribute. It is important to see how you are different in each film. You have to become the character," he said.\u000aThe actor has three films in the pipeline.\u000a"I have got three movies in September-October. There is Besharam, War Chhod Na Yaar and Mr. Joe B Carvalho. They are good films and all three are different. I have also signed one or two films which I will start shooting after that," he said.\u000a

VKolkata: JSW Steel is working towards a de-risking strategy for iron ore that will fuel its ambition to turn its Bellary plant into world's largest single-site steel plant by 2022.\u000a"We are setting up 500km slurry pipeline to import iron-ore into the Vijayanagar plant in Bellary from a port near Goa. My vision is to turn Vijayanagar from 10 million tonne to 20 million tonne, world's largest single site steel plant by 2022," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said on Sunday.\u000aHe was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Insdag.\u000aHe said Karnataka can offer maximum iron-ore of 15 million tonne, while to take the steel production to 20 million tonne, JSW would require 35 million tonne of iron-ore.\u000aMr Jindal said laying the 500 km pipeline from Jaigarh near Goa to the Bellary district would cost about Rs. 2000 crore and it will come up over the next two years.\u000aThe project will pump imported iron-ore from overseas sources and will have an annual freight cost saving of Rs. 2000 crore and that will help neutralise the cost disadvantage of imported iron-ore, the company said.\u000aJSW on Sunday said only 50 per cent of its iron-ore requirement is fed by domestic sources, most of which is from Karnataka.\u000a

VEoin Morgan wants to stay captain despite England's inability to reach the Cricket World Cup 2015 quarterfinals. Morgan admitted England played poor cricket and suffered. Morgan said the responsibility of not playing well enough in the World Cup should fall on the players and not the coach alone. In their last group match on Friday, England beat Afghanistan by nine wickets in a train-hit match in Sydney.

VThe mercury level in Bhubaneswar today reached at 44.1 degree Celsius, the highest temperature in the city since 2010. (File photo)\u000aBhubaneswar:  The Odisha capital today recorded a temperature of 44.1 degree Celsius, the highest temperature since 2010 as heat wave conditions prevailed in some parts of the state with the mercury crossing the 42 degree Celsius mark in more than half a dozen towns.\u000aBhubaneswar was followed by coal town of Talcher where mercury level touched 43.6 degree Celsius and the industrial town of Jharsuguda 43.1 degree Celsius.\u000aThe towns and cities which recorded temperature above 42 degree C were: Angul and Hirakud (42.7 each), Titlagarh (42.5), Chandbali (42.3), Baripada and Sambalpur (42.2), Sundargarh and Malkangiri (42).\u000aStating that temperature in Odisha has gone up by 4 to 5 degree Celsius this time, IMD director S C Sahu said the heat wave condition was likely to continue for at least two more days.\u000aThe mercury level in Bhubaneswar today reached at 44.1 degree Celsius, the highest temperature in the city since 2010.\u000aThough the state capital yesterday recorded 42.2 degree C, the mercury level started increasing from this morning and reached 44.1 degrees C by 1.30 pm, MeT officials said.\u000aLife became miserable as the humidity level also went up to 84 per cent in the state capital pushing the citizens indoors till evening. The state capital had recorded the highest temperature at 43.6 degrees on April 9, 2010, they said.\u000a"The amount of rainfall and the soil condition determine the rise and fall in temperature of a place. If the soil is covered with grass, evaporation occurs as the heat takes away the moisture from the grassy soil. As a result, the atmosphere becomes cool. But as there is no substantial rainfall in Odisha since October last year, the soil has become dry," Mr Sahu said.\u000aMeanwhile, a bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department said that the heat wave condition prevailed over some parts of Coastal Odisha.\u000aIt said rainfall occurred at one or two places over North Odisha and weather had been dry over the rest of Odisha. The maximum temperatures were appreciably above normal over North\u000aInterior Odisha and above normal in the rest of Odisha.\u000a

The ship is still there in the custody of the Iranian authorities at Bandar Abbas port," a top Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) official told PTI.\u000aMT Desh Shanti, the tanker belonging to the country's largest ocean liner SCI, was detained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on August 12 in Persian Gulf and taken to Bandar Abbas port while carrying crude from Basrah in Iraq.\u000aThe official said there was no pollution from the vessel which is nine years old and can carry 140,000 tonnes of crude.\u000a"Indian Embassy in Tehran is pro-actively engaged in talks with Iran officials for the release of the ship. There has been no pollution by the ship and we expect some positive development," another SCI official said.\u000aThe development comes at a time when India, the world's fourth-largest oil importer, has significantly reduced its import of crude oil from Iran following severe financial sanctions from the western countries against the Islamic republic.\u000aThe Iranian embassy in Delhi in a statement on Friday had said that the detention was "purely a technical and non-political issue".\u000aIndia's crude imports from Iran plunged by more than 26.5 per cent in the 2012-13 financial year (Apr-Mar) as US and European sanctions on Tehran combined to make it difficult for Indian refiners to ship Iranian oil.\u000aImports of Iranian crude fell to 13.3 million mt, or close to 267,100 b/d, in 2012-13 from 18.1 million mt, or around 362,500 b/d, in 2011-12.\u000aEarlier sources had said Iran had slipped to sixth place among India's top crude suppliers in the year to March 31 from second place behind OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia in the previous financial year.\u000a

VThe average prevalence of a birth defect was 5.7 per cent among naturally conceived births.\u000aMelbourne:  Babies born to women aged over 40 from assisted reproduction have fewer birth defects compared with those from women who conceive naturally at that age, a new study has found.\u000aThis is contrary to widespread belief that the greater risk of birth defects after assisted conception is due to the frequent use of these services by older women.\u000aAccording to researchers from the University of Adelaide in Australia, this may point to the presence of more favourable biological conditions in IVF (in vitro fertilisations) specific to pregnancies in older women - but they are currently working to determine the exact cause.\u000aThe research is based on data of all live births recorded in Australia from 1986-2002, including more than 301,000 naturally conceived births, as well as 2,200 births from IVF and almost 1400 from ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).\u000aThe average prevalence of a birth defect was 5.7 per cent among naturally conceived births, 7.1 per cent for the IVF births, and 9.9 per cent for the ICSI births, across all age groups.\u000aIn births from assisted reproduction, the prevalence of birth defects ranged from 11.3 per cent at its highest for women less than age 30 using ICSI, down to 3.6 per cent for women aged 40 and older using IVF.\u000aFor natural conceptions, the corresponding prevalence across age groups was 5.6 per cent in young women, increasing to 8.2 per cent in women aged 40 above.\u000a"There is something quite remarkable occurring with women over the age of 40 who use assisted reproduction," said lead author Michael Davies, professor from University of Adelaide.\u000a"We know from our previous studies that women who undergo assisted reproduction have an increased rate of birth defects compared to women who conceive naturally," said Davies.\u000a"We also know that among women who conceive naturally, the rate of birth defects increases exponentially from age 35 onwards. Therefore, it was widely assumed, but untested, that maternal age would be a key factor in birth defects from assisted reproduction," Davies added.\u000a"However, our findings challenge that assertion. They show that infertile women aged 40 and over who used assisted reproduction had less than half the rate of birth defects of fertile women of the same age, while younger women appear to be at an elevated risk," he said.\u000a"For women treated with IVF and ICSI combined, the greatest age-related risk of birth defects was among the young women, at or around 29 years of age," he said.\u000a"With a prevalence of 9.4 per cent their risk was more than double the rate of 3.6 per cent observed for the patients aged over 40, and significantly higher than for fertile women of the same age, at 5.6 per cent," Davies said.\u000a"There is some aspect of IVF treatment in particular that could be helping older women to redress the maternal age issues we see among natural conception, where we observe a transition at around the age of 35 years toward a steadily increasing risk of birth defects," he said.\u000aThe study appears in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.\u000a

He has gone for Rabindratnath Tagore's music and classic compositions by Chopin. Two different schools of music are coming together for the first time in an Indian film."\u000a

Here are the highlights of Dr Singh's speech:\u000aI am thankful that you all came to this rally \u000aToday I am going to speak about certain work done by the UPA govt \u000aWe have worked on the principles of the Congress party\u000aWe have worked for the betterment of the common man \u000aI want to inform you how we are going to help change our nation and also the progress of our nation \u000aPeople are plagued by unemployment\u000aWe took some decisions recently. And some people are trying to mislead the public\u000aNo nation can address its biggest challenges without economic development\u000aWe have made efforts to create an investor-friendly environment and have been successful to a large extent\u000aWe have set new records in economic growth\u000aWe have laid special emphasis on infrastructure. We are going create better roads \u000aThe economic development of the country needs to reach the poor and common people\u000aWe believe that economic development should enable everyone to get all the basic amenities\u000aIn rural areas, water and electricity has been supplied\u000aMajority of our population is involved in agricultural sector\u000aWe want our farmers to get the benefits\u000aIt is our dream to work towards an strong and prosperous nation and we will not spare any effort to achieve that\u000aWe need many times to adopt the more difficult path rather than take the easy way out because that may be beneficial for the country's future\u000aWe have also concentrated on infants and the nourishment of mother and the kid\u000aIn order to reach our goal, we will have to take difficult decisions\u000aOn FDI: This decision is for the betterment of the people. We want our farmers to be happy and prosperous\u000aOpposition has said that FDI will take jobs away from people, either they are trying to fool the people or are not aware about the benefits\u000aWe want FDI in retail primarily in the bigger cities\u000aWe have seen other countries progressing after introduction of FDI in retail\u000aThis is not the first time we've brought in foreign investment. We've done it before and today we are reaping its benefits\u000aThe difference between us and those opposing us is that the Congress party and the govt want to create a change in society\u000aThe govt's subsidy bill is growing. The growing fiscal deficit will hurt the people of this country in the long run. That's why we were compelled to raise petroleum prices. We had a major internal debate on those decisions. We felt this needed to be done in larger national interest\u000a

VLondon:  Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will face criminal charges in Britain over allegations they conspired with bookmakers to fix a match last year against England.\u000aThe trio have protested their innocence to the International Cricket Council but Britain's Crown Prosecution Service says they and their agent have been summoned on charges of "conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments."\u000aThe players have been suspended from all cricket since Sept. 3 after a British tabloid alleged they bowled no-balls at prearranged times during August's fourth test at Lord's to fix spot betting markets.\u000aIt was alleged 150,000 pounds ($241,000) was forwarded through businessman Mazhar Majeed.\u000a

VFingerprint Cards is aiming to sell its identity technology to most of the world's biggest smartphone makers, which are likely to follow Apple in offering touch recognition for mobiles from next year.\u000a\u000aApple's September launch of the iPhone 5S was the first smartphone with a fingerprint identity touch sensor, provided by AuthenTec, part of Apple.\u000a\u000aFollowing on from this, Sweden's Fingerprint hopes to sell its own touch sensors to other big mobile phone makers like Samsung, LG Electronics and Huawei.\u000a\u000a"I think at least seven or eight will launch a phone with a touch sensor in 2014," Johan Carlstrom, Fingerprint's Chief Executive Officer, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aHe said Fingerprint Cards hoped to clinch contracts with the majority of those firms after announcing last week new touch fingerprint sensors for Android smartphones and tablets, and the Windows operating system.\u000a\u000aCarlstrom said Fingerprint expected Samsung, the world's biggest maker of smartphones, to launch at least one smartphone - or probably even two - with either a swipe or touch fingerprint sensor next year.\u000a\u000a"Samsung is well known for having multiple suppliers for most components and our goal is to be selected as one of their sensor suppliers already in 2014," he said.\u000a\u000aFingerprint is one of only a handful of global specialists in touch sensor technology. Rival AuthenTec was bought by Apple and Validity was bought by Synaptics in October.\u000a\u000aFingerprint already has contracts to supply its cheaper "swipe" fingerprint technology to Japan's Fujitsu, South Korea'sPantech and China's Konka.\u000a\u000aThe company has forecast a fivefold increase in revenues for 2014 to at least 500 million Swedish crowns. Its share price has surged more than 600 percent in the past year.\u000a\u000aIn October, Fingerprint was caught up in a hoax following a fake press release which claimed Samsung was buying the company for $650 million.\u000a\u000aThe Swedish Economic Crime Authority launched a fraud probe. Carlstrom declined to comment on the case on Wednesday, saying that an investigation was underway.\u000a\u000aFingerprint's revenues have been dominated by sales of fingerprint security products to Chinese banks like Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\u000a\u000aBut in the third quarter of this year, more than 50 percent of revenues came from mobile phones, Carlstrom said, a trend the company expects will continue.\u000a\u000aThe group expects to secure a 60 percent share of the smartphone market for touch sensors in 2014 and 2015, excluding Apple smartphones.\u000a\u000aThe smartphone market is growing rapidly. Worldwide smartphone shipments are forecast to grow 40 percent year-over- year to more than 1.0 billion units this year, according to International Data Corporation.\u000a\u000aLast year, when Apple bought fingerprint sensor developer AuthenTec for $356 million this was viewed as a signal that the technology would finally go mainstream.\u000a\u000a"It was an industry breakthrough and certainly opens the flood gates and starts a new industry," Carlstrom said.\u000a\u000aHe said that Apple, which also looked at Fingerprint back in 2010 when it was eyeing AuthenTec, sets the agenda for smartphone makers when it comes to functionality and design.\u000a\u000aAsked if he would be open to a sale, Carlstrom said that given the industry's growth potential, he believed the company - with a $488 million market capitalisation - was not yet fully valued.\u000a\u000a"We are just at the beginning of the growth phase," said Carlstrom, who has spent 25 years in the telecommunications industry. "We have no intention to sell at the current time, and at current valuations," he said.

VTalks for Taiwan's Foxconn to acquire a majority stake in Japan's Sharp Corp are "on the right track", people familiar with the matter said on Monday, after a last-minute hitch over contingent liabilities caused delays last month.\u000a\u000aDiscussions are set to conclude this week, one person said, adding that most of the due diligence is done.\u000a\u000aFoxconn late last month suspended the signing of a deal to take over the loss-making Japanese electronics firm, citing the emergence of new material information. The announcement came after Sharp's board voted in favour of Foxconn's offer, estimated at nearly $6 billion (roughly Rs. 40,229 crores).\u000a\u000aSharp shares were 6 percent higher in afternoon trade.\u000a\u000aTerry Gou, chief executive of Foxconn, is in Bangkok to participate in a business expansion meeting sponsored by Sharp, the Taiwanese firm, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, said on Monday, adding that he was invited to attend by Sharp.\u000a\u000aHis attendance signals Gou has begun to participate in Sharp's activities, said a separate source familiar with Foxconn's thinking.\u000a\u000a"It is not important when an official signing will take place, but that Gou, who thinks 2-3 steps ahead of everyone, is already going into action by being in Thailand today," the person said.\u000a\u000aSources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to the media. Sharp and Foxconn declined to comment on Monday on the state of progress of the discussions.\u000a\u000aFoxconn said in a statement on the weekend that there was no firm date to sign a deal with Sharp as both sides continued to make progress towards an agreement.\u000a\u000aThe hitch to Foxconn's takeover of Japan's struggling Sharp centered on information that listed around JPY 300 billion ($2.7 billion or roughly Rs. 18,101 crores) in contingent liabilities at Sharp, sources have previously said. These were worst-case scenario risks that might happen in the future, but not liabilities that required formal disclosure, they added.

He says the way they are "laid out" makes a "compelling case" it is where "someone has come to rest."\u000aHe released the full image this week to coincide with the disaster's centenary.

VBangalore:  Temperatures in Bangalore may have dropped after Wednesday's rain; however its garbage problem has now resurfaced. Locals have once again complained that garbage hasn't been picked since the last few days up in many localities, creating a mess.\u000aWhile the municipal authorities claim that garbage from most parts of Bangalore is being cleared, mountains of muck is still found in some prime locations. The rain only made it worse for commuters as the already piled up filth began flowing onto the roads.\u000aFormer Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, now estranged from his party, the BJP, used this as an opportunity to hit out at the state government. "If Bangalore Municipal Corporation doesn't clear the garbage on war footing, then I will sit in protest in front of the corporation office. This never happened when I was in power. This type of garbage has never been here like this for the last 15 years," he said.\u000aThe garbage problem in Bangalore is not new. In August, the garden city witnessed several tonnes of filth strewn across the city as the main dump at Mavallipura outside the city - that usually receives the city's waste - was closed following protests by villagers living in the area and a closure notice from the state's pollution control board.\u000aAfter the waste began piling up, the clean-up finally began after pressure from the public and the media. Even the Karnataka High Court criticised the corporation's functioning following a Public Interest Litigation filed on the garbage issue.\u000a

There is no restraint on the India-New Zealand matches and they should go on. God help them if BCCI twists the panel's report," Lodha told NDTV, clearly hinting that the Board and its bankers did not interpret the committee's e-mail properly.\u000aPlease download the latest flash player to watch videos.\u000a

VPeople casting their votes at a polling station in Khunti in second phase of Jharkhand Assembly polls (PTI photo)\u000aRanchi:  The BJP today claimed that results of Lok Sabha elections have triggered a "revolutionary change" infusing national perspective into the assembly elections earlier contested on local issues.\u000a"People used to vote on (the basis of) local issues, which influenced previous assembly elections. But now a revolutionary change has taken place in the country after the Lok Sabha elections," BJP's national spokesman GVL Narasimha Rao said in Ranchi.\u000aHe attributed lack of national trends as the reason behind local issues dominating assembly elections and cited examples of voting behaviour from state to state that differed. He showed how results in Bihar and Jharkhand had been different in the previous two elections.\u000a"But now the people want to connect with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his wave has gained momentum even after the LS polls," Mr Rao said and cited results of Haryana and Maharashtra as examples of PM Modi's increasing popularity.\u000aAlleging that the Hemant Soren government had been the 'worst' regime in Jharkhand, Mr Rao said, "It's not a coalition government but a compromise government with transfer-posting becoming an industry and corruption being at its peak."\u000aTo a query that all previous governments too faced such allegations, Mr Rao denied it and said the previous BJP-led governments had been 'good' and the party's present goal was to put the development process on the fast track.\u000a

VLondon:  Two persons have been arrested in connection with the death of 21-year-old NRI Gagandip Singh who was found dead in the boot of a burnt car in Blackheath, police said today.\u000aSingh, who is from Bexleyheath, was discovered dead after a parked Mercedes was seen on fire in south London.\u000aDetectives are questioning a woman and a man - who are both 19 years old - for possible involvement in Singh's murder, Scotland Yard said in a statement.\u000aOfficers on patrol discovered the burning Mercedes in Blackheath early on Saturday morning and called the fire brigade.\u000aDetective Chief Inspector Damian Allain, from the Metropolitan Police Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: "We are appealing for anyone who was in or around the Angerstein Lane area that may have seen this car either arrive or seen anyone acting suspiciously as the car was left ablaze to contact us. We already know that the car was last seen around 5.30pm in South East London, so we are also appealing to anyone who can help us identify how the car came to be in Angerstein Lane. At this early stage we don't believe that this was a random killing and are exploring the line of inquiry that this was a targeted attack against our victim. A post-mortem examination held yesterday at Greenwich Mortuary proved inconclusive. Tests revealed the victim suffered severe head injuries. However, further tests would be conducted in order to establish cause of death."\u000a

VDubai:\u000aIndia and the UAE are set to sign an agreement for promotion and protection of bilateral investments.\u000aBilateral Investment Protection Agreement (BIPA), to be signed next week in New Delhi, will provide a comprehensive framework to investors from both the countries, the outgoing Ambassador of India to the UAE M K Lokesh said on Sunday.\u000a"A delegation from the UAE, headed by the Foreign Minister, will visit New Delhi next week to sign the agreement," Mr Lokesh was quoted as saying by the Gulf News.\u000a"India and UAE have historic ties. The relationship is important for both the countries. Both sides have worked hard to get this agreement ready that will regain investor confidence," he said at a farewell lunch organised by the Indian Business and Professional Council (IBPC), Dubai.\u000aThe UAE has investment interests in India mainly through Emaar and Etisalat while India has varied investment in the UAE, surpassing 200 billion dirhams, figures released by IBPC said.\u000aBilateral trade between the two sides goes back to centuries, with India now among the UAE's biggest trading partners.\u000a"The landmark agreement will be a fitting farewell gift to the ambassador, whose 43-month tenure has seen trade between the two countries almost double from 161.5 billion dirhams three years ago to 275.25 billion dirhams. This is a golden era of India-UAE relationship and Ambassador Lokesh has played a key role in improving the relationship further," Paras Shahdadpuri, IBPC president said.\u000a

VThe Aam Aadmi Party has given corruption in Delhi cricket a dramatic twist. The political feuding over the CBI raid on Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, became fiercer on Thursday with AAP demanding the resignation of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who was president of Delhi and District Cricket Association. Charges of corruption in DDCA have been rampant over the years. Is Jaitley to be blamed? An NDTV Sports debate.\u000a

VMexico:  A video "mockumentary" that shows children as kidnappers, corrupt cops and drug traffickers sparked a fierce debate in violence-torn Mexico on Thursday, with some people calling it a needed wake-up call while others described it as political manipulation or even child abuse.\u000aKids playing the role of businessmen, criminals and corrupt officials are seen robbing, paying bribes and shooting it out in a mock Mexico made up entirely of children, all to the deceptively laid-back tune of the 1970s ballad "Una Manana," or "One Morning."\u000aProduced by a foundation supported by private companies and universities and distributed over the Internet, the video ends with a direct message to the candidates in the Mexico's July 1 Presidential race. A little girl faces the camera and says: "If this is the future that awaits me, I don't want it. Enough of working for your political parties instead of for us. Enough of cosmetic changes."\u000aDubbed "Ninos Incomodos," roughly "Discomforting Kids," the four-minute video opens with a pudgy kid-businessman waking up in the morning dragging on a cigarette, and closes with a kiddie-version of alleged drug lord Edgar Valdez, aka "La Barbie," being dragged off to an overcrowded jail full of moppets by kiddie cops.\u000aLittle girls carrying purses scream and scurry for cover as boys of their own age spray machine guns from huge Sports Utility Vehicles and assault-rifle toting little cops run to detain them at gunpoint.\u000aDespite the video's grim images of knife-wielding, migrant-smuggling, gun-toting kids, all the major candidates had praise for it. Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called it "well done, it's tough but it's the truth."\u000aEarlier, the candidate of the former governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, Enrique Pena Nieto, wrote in his Twitter account: "I support the message of Discomforting Kids. I hear it all the time on the campaign trail; that 'time is running out.' It's time to renew hope and change Mexico. "\u000aJosefina Vazquez Mota, the candidate of President Felipe Calderon's conservative National Action Party, tweeted that "the video of Discomforting Kids is a call that can't be ignored. I accept the challenge, I want to join you."\u000aNot everyone was happy, however.\u000aThe video's vision of a smog-choked, apocalyptic Mexico where kid cops crack down on tiny anti-corruption protesters while pint-sized lazy or corrupt politicians stand by is manipulative, and no candidate could afford to criticize it, TV critic and newspaper columnist Alvaro Cueva said.\u000a"No sane candidate is going to say, 'I want a future with crime, a future with criminals," Cueva said.\u000aHe called the video damaging and "a very clear violation of the (electoral) law."\u000aIt is a sensitive question in Mexico, where many people believe the 2006 elections were unfairly influenced by a series of privately produced and sponsored ads that sought to inspire fear of Lopez Obrador, warning Mexicans they could "lose everything" if he were elected. He narrowly lost to Calderon.\u000a"The only thing this video does is to further muddy the election campaigns," Cueva said. "This video does nothing but foment a sense of desperation and despair."\u000aWhile the 2006 "fear" ads against Lopez Obrador, sponsored by private business groups, benefited Calderon, Cueva thinks this year's fear-video benefits the presidential front-runner, Pena Nieto, whose PRI party has extensive machines in most states that could help him win in the event of a low voter turnout.\u000a"When one watches this video, one loses any desire to vote, and so it foments a low turnout, and in an environment of low turnout, the winner is the PRI candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto," Cueva said.\u000aPena Nieto's campaign was not immediately available to comment.\u000aOthers, like former presidential spokesman and political analyst Ruben Aguilar, accepted the private group's arguments that the video is an attempt to make citizens think.\u000a"In this country, everyone thinks the worst, and they can never accept that somebody is doing something good," Aguilar said. "I think it is good, it is intelligent and it can help."\u000aThe group that made the video, headed by Mexican insurance company GNP, took out full-page ads in Mexican newspapers saying it was merely reflecting the concerns of millions of citizens "who want to see themselves living in a Mexico that has left behind crime, corruption poverty, unemployment, drug trafficking."\u000aBut some objected to the video's use of children.\u000a"It is unacceptable, scandalous, that they have shown children smoking, armed, kidnapping people with pistols and locking them in trunks," Labor Party congressman Mario di Costanzo said on the floor of Congress on Wednesday.\u000aPRI Congressman Miguel Angel Garcia Granados called on the Calderon administration to ban the video.\u000a"We are not going to solve the big problems this country faces with sensationalism and shrillness, and certainly not by using underage children in documentaries," said Garcia Granados.\u000a0\u000a

VThe world's most powerful Internet and media barons gather in Paris on Tuesday in a show of strength to leaders at the G8 summit, amid international rows over online access, copyright and regulation.\u000a\u000aTop executives from online giants like Google, Facebook and Microsoft will tout the economic potential of the Internet, which their host, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has put on the agenda of the G8 summit two days later.\u000a\u000aAfter Tuesday and Wednesday's "e-G8" bash, some of the biggest names will then meet with G8 leaders at the summit in Deauville, northwestern France, on May 26 and 27, a French presidential official said.\u000a\u000a"For the first time, voices of companies, thinkers and major players who build the Internet will be heard at the highest levels of world politics," said a statement by PR firm Publicis, commissioned by Sarkozy to organise the e-G8.\u000a\u000aWith blogs and Tweets oiling the wheels of revolutions in some countries and scans and downloads sparking trade disputes in others, the stakes are high for leaders seeking to promote and profit from the web but also to regulate it.\u000a\u000aThe e-G8 "aims to enlighten and to nourish the discussions of the heads of G8 nations with the vision of the web actors regarding the Internet's importance and impact on society and the economy," the organisers said.\u000a\u000aBut some bloggers and activists saw the e-G8 not as a gesture of openness but a bid to tighten governments' grip on the Internet for power and money.\u000a\u000a"Under the guise of a pseudo-consultative process, it is the governments' desire to control the Internet a bit more that is becoming apparent," French Internet freedom campaign group Le Quadrature du Net wrote on its website.\u000a\u000a"Behind the smokescreen of this 'forum', citizens must hold world leaders more responsible for their actions and denounce the many continual breaches of their liberties."\u000a\u000aAuthorities in several countries have clashed with Google, the world's biggest Internet search engine, notably in China, where the company accused the government of hacking dissidents' email accounts.\u000a\u000aFrance is expected to propose a statement in Deauville on "respecting freedoms" on the web, a French official said -- a jab at censorship in rising world powers such as China.\u000a\u000aBut, while acknowledging the Internet's power as a force for freedom elsewhere, western countries' differ on how to harness or curb it on their own doorsteps.\u000a\u000aMedia freedom campaigners including Reporters Without Borders have criticised moves by some European countries, such as a recent French law making web users liable to prosecution if they illegally download films and music.\u000a\u000aGerman and Italian regulators have placed restrictions on Google's Street View, over privacy concerns for people photographed in its online street maps.\u000a\u000aIn France, several publishers accuse Google of scanning their copyrighted books for its online library, although one major publisher, Hachette Livre, has struck a deal with the Californian company.\u000a\u000aSarkozy has called for "a civilised Internet" and has proposed another gathering, on online copyright protection, ahead of the November meeting of leaders of the Group of 20, a bigger club of rich and emerging powers.\u000a\u000aThis drive may worry the United States, sensitive to talk of regulation.\u000a\u000aThe e-G8 guests include the executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt; the founder of social site Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; and Jeff Bezos, founder of online retail giant Amazon. Microsoft will also be represented.\u000a\u000aAlso attending is Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire head of the global media empire News Corporation, which includes Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, and dubbed by Forbes magazine "the man who owns the news."\u000a\u000aMurdoch's recent decision to start charging for content on news websites rattled the media world, where companies are struggling to work out how to make money from journalism in the Internet age.\u000a\u000aFrance touted the meetings of the e-G8 and the G8 as an unprecedented meeting of the online and political worlds.\u000a\u000a"The wish of the heads of state is to hear the world's top Internet figures talk about their vision for the future so that they can incorporate it in their own decisions," a French presidential official told reporters.

VThe suicide of Rohith Vemula had triggered a huge political furore.\u000aNew Delhi:  Raising questions on Rohith Vemula's Dalit status, a commission constituted by HRD ministry after the Hyderabad university scholar's death has said the material on record did not establish it and attributed his suicide to personal reasons.\u000aThe Justice Roopanwal Commission, in its report to the HRD ministry, has given a clean chit to Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya, sources said.\u000aThe university authorities too have been absolved of any blame for Vemula's death as the commission has held that they were not working under political pressure.\u000aThe commission is learnt to have raised questions about Vemula's caste status as a Dalit saying that there is no proof that his mother V Radhika belonged to "Mala" community.\u000aThe commission in its report noted that Vemula's mother was not told the names of her biological parents by her foster family, according to the sources.\u000aIt is therefore unlikely that she would have been told the caste of her biological parents, the commission is understood to have said.\u000aHRD ministry officials have, however, maintained that ascertaining the caste status of Vemula was not part of the Terms of Reference of the commission. Therefore they would only focus on those recommendations which aim at ensuring that such incidents do not happen in the future.\u000aThe suicide of Vemula had triggered a huge political furore with the then HRD minister Smriti Irani coming under attack along with Labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya for having written a letter related to the matter.\u000aIt is learnt that the commission felt that Vemula has committed suicide because of his "personal frustrations". In its recommendation, the commission has emphasised that there should be a proper counselling mechanism not just for students but also for research scholars.\u000aThe sources said that in its recommendations, the commission has also emphasised that there should be proper grievance redressal mechanisms and equal opportunity cells so that unfortunate incidents like suicide can be prevented.\u000a

VKuala Lumpur:  Australia will host a meeting with Malaysia and China next week to determine the way forward in the frustrating search for flight MH370, officials said in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.\u000aThe Canberra meeting, announced by Australia's MH370 search chief Angus Houston, follows the decision this week to scale back the costly search operation in the Indian Ocean that has so far turned up no evidence that the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed. ( Planes head home as MH370 search scaled back )\u000a"That's a very important meeting because it will formalise the way ahead to ensure that this search continues with urgency and doesn't stop at any stage," said Houston, who is on a brief visit to Malaysia.\u000aMalaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who spoke to reporters in Kuala Lumpur along with Houston, said he would attend.\u000aOfficials have said recently that more sophisticated assets may need to be brought in for the so-far fruitless search of the Indian Ocean seabed for wreckage.\u000aAn intensive aerial search for surface wreckage from flight MH370 officially ended on Wednesday, with ships also moving out of the remote search zone.\u000aAustralian authorities have said the focus would move "over the coming weeks" to an intensified undersea search. ( Indian Ocean undersea hunt for missing Flight MH370 set to be extended )\u000aThe jet disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard and is believed to have inexplicably diverted to the Indian Ocean and crashed, but no evidence has been found.\u000aOfficials have said the focus will shift to an expanded underwater search with a sophisticated US Navy sonar device across a huge swathe of seabed.\u000aWhile saying the challenge was immense, Houston said he was confident MH370 will eventually be found.\u000a"We are totally committed, as three nations I believe, to finding MH370 and I am confident that with an effective search we will find the aircraft," he said.\u000aChina is involved because two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese.\u000aThe submersible Bluefin-21 has been scouring the seabed in an area where undersea transmissions were detected, believed to have come from the plane's black box flight recorders before their batteries died.\u000aHouston said the Bluefin-21 would continue scanning until the end of May. He did not specify what would happen afterwards but said it could take between eight to 12 months to fully search the suspected crash area.\u000aThe zone was determined based on an analysis of imprecise data from satellites that detected the plane as if flew.\u000aHishammuddin and Houston both said they still believed the search was in the right area.\u000aAuthorities earlier this week dismissed claims by an Australia-based marine exploration company that it had detected elements in the Bay of Bengal, far to the north, consistent with aircraft materials and which could be from MH370. ( Wreckage in Bay of Bengal not from MH370: searchers )\u000aHouston said three ships from Bangladesh were looking in that area but had so far found nothing.\u000a

VSanjay Nirupam had yesterday raised questions on the veracity of surgical strikes by the Indian Army.\u000aMumbai:  Shiv Sena today demanded that sedition charges be slapped on Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam for questioning the integrity of the Army and sought his immediate removal from the party's Mumbai chief post.\u000aMr Nirupam had yesterday raised questions on the veracity of the surgical strikes by the Army on terror launch pads across the LoC,\u000a"Nirupam needs to be lessoned on keeping blind faith on our Army. It is surprising that he can dare to question the veracity of the Army operations at a time when even Congress president and vice-president have made their stand very clear on this issue," Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said.\u000aShe claimed that before the Army action, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken all Opposition parties into confidence and briefed them about the exact situation at the Line of Control (LoC).\u000a"We demand that a sedition case be slapped against Nirupam as he is toeing the line of an enemy nation which says surgical strikes never took place. He has disgraced the nation in front of world leaders," Ms Kayande said.\u000a"Also, we demand that he should be immediately ousted from his post because a person who cannot respect the Army can never respect people and serve them," the Sena leader said.\u000aMr Nirupam suggested the army surgical strike was "fake". He also went on to demand "some evidence" to prove that the strikes did take place and accused the ruling BJP at the Centre of indulging in politics over the issue.\u000a"Every Indian wants surgical strikes against Pakistan but not a fake one to extract just political benefit by BJP. politics over national interest(sic)," Mr Nirupam had tweeted, kicking up a row over the emotive issue.\u000aMeanwhile, revealing a vertical within the party, Congress leader Arif Naseem Khan said Nirupam should not have used this sensitive issue for "political gains".\u000a"All parties are one as long as the country's unity and security is concerned. Also, the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi) and vice-president (Rahul Gandhi) have made their stand very clear on this issue. There is no reason for other party leaders like Nirupam ji to take a different stand over the issue," he said.\u000a"It is not right to use this sensitive issue for political gains," Mr Khan said.\u000aThe Congress had yesterday dissociated itself from Mr Nirupam's remarks on the surgical strikes, saying it has full faith in the armed forces even as it asked the government to use "all information and evidence" at its disposal to call "Pakistan's bluff" and expose its false propaganda.\u000a

VNew Delhi:\u000aFord India today said it expects to export its upcoming compact sports utility vehicle EcoSport to about 40 countries after the vehicle's launch here within the next few months.\u000a"We have ambitious plans for exporting EcoSport in the international market. The Figo is currently exported to 38 markets from India. We hope to repeat that or even better it with the EcoSport," Ford India President and Managing Director Joginder Singh told PTI on the sidelines of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) AGM here.\u000aThe company sees a clear opportunity in exports on account of favourable factors such as cost efficiency in manufacturing at its plant in Chennai, he added.\u000aFord India is expected to launch the EcoSport by June this year. The vehicle will be introduced in three engine options with both manual and automatic transmissions.\u000aTalking about Ford India's overall export plan, Singh said the company will sell 25 per cent of the combined installed capacity of Chennai and the upcoming plant in Sanand plants in the overseas markets.\u000aIn case of engines, the company will sell 40 per cent of the total installed capacity in overseas markets, he added.\u000a"Our plan to make India the global export hub for Ford is on track," Singh said, adding the company is not putting on hold its investment at Sanand plant despite the slowdown in Indian auto market.\u000aFord India is investing $1 billion (Rs. 5439 crore) to set up its second production facility at Sanand that will be operational by 2014. The plant will have an installed output capacity of 2.4 lakh vehicles and 2.7 lakh engines annually.\u000aWith completion of the Sanand plant in Gujarat, Ford India will have a total installed capacity of rolling out 4.4 lakh vehicles and 6.1 lakh engines every year.\u000aIn November last year, the subsidiary of the US car major Ford had said it will make India its export hub with plans to sell its products in over 50 nations over a period of time.\u000aFord India had reported 38.28 per cent decline in its total sales in March this year at 7,499 units. It had sold a total of 12,150 units in the same month last year.\u000aThe domestic sales also went down by 41.61 per cent to 5,271 units in March this year as against 9,028 units in the same month last year.\u000aThe company exported 2,228 units last month compared to 3,122 units in the year-ago period, registering a fall of 28.64 per cent.\u000a

VFew days back, a new LeEco handset was leaked in images and was claimed to be the successor to the popular Le 1s . The handset was rumoured to be dubbed the LeEco Le 2, though a new leaked image of a retail box label tips the smartphone may be called the LeEco Le 2 Pro - of course, it may be a different model from what had been leaked earlier.\u000a\u000aAccording to the leaked label, the Le 2 Pro will feature a 5.7-inch QHD display; Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor; 4GB of RAM; 21-megapixel rear camera with LED flash; 8-megapixel front camera; 64GB inbuilt storage; LTE support; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth, and USB Type-C. The leaked retail box label claimed to be of the Le 2 Pro smartphone also indicates that the handset will sport Dolby Audio powered speakers. Unfortunately, there is no word on the Android version of the smartphone. The leaked label was first spotted by Mobipicker.\u000a\u000aThe earlier leaked images of the LeEco Le 2 Pro smartphone showed images purportedly showing the smartphone from every angle. One of the biggest changes seen on the handset was the new LeEco branding at the rear panel which replaced the Letv logo. To recall, the Chinese Internet conglomerate Letv had announced that it re-branded the company name to LeEco in a move to focus towards entering different global markets. The front of the Le 2 Pro seemed to be identical to the Le 1s smartphone.\u000a\u000aThe alleged successor also picked design cues for the speaker grille placement. The right side of the Le 2 Pro in the image showed the volume rocker and power button placed in the same position as the Le 1s (Review). The rear panel was the place where the handset looked to have all the changes as there was no round fingerprint scanner - instead it's was square. As seen in the leaked images, the camera placement was again at the left top corner of the Le 2 Pro, similar to the Le 1s. The fingerprint scanner was also said to gain some improvements - claimed to be of "ultrasonic variety", which was not detailed.\u000a\u000aAll these leaks should be taken with a pinch of salt as LeEco has not mentioned anything about the upcoming device and the legitimacy of the leaks remains questionable.

VOrbital ATK on Wednesday counted down to its first space launch since a sudden explosion last year destroyed its Antares rocket and cargo craft bound for the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThursday's planned liftoff of the unmanned Cygnus cargo ship uses a different rocket an Atlas V made by United Launch Alliance and is scheduled for 5:55pm (10:55pm GMT or 4:25am IST, Friday).\u000a\u000aThe weather forecast for launch was 60 percent favorable, Nasa's weather officer said.\u000a\u000aOrbital executives denied any jitters on the eve of the launch, more than a year after the blastoff at Wallops Island, Virginia.\u000a\u000a"We feel extremely confident or we wouldn't be sitting on top of that rocket right now," Frank Culbertson, president of the Space Systems Group at Orbital ATK, told reporters.\u000a\u000a"We tend not to be melodramatic about those things," he added.\u000a\u000a"Right now we are focused on the success of this mission and getting the cargo to the space station. Very optimistic."\u000a\u000aIn October 2014, an Orbital rocket packed with thousands of pounds of supplies exploded seconds after takeoff, marking the first catastrophic failure since private companies began resupplying the orbiting outpost in 2010.\u000a\u000aIt was followed eight months later by a SpaceX rocket explosion, and the consecutive accidents effectively shut off the flow of US supplies to astronauts in orbit.\u000a\u000aA Russian Progress ship was also lost after launch in April, but International Space Station program managers said the astronauts were never in danger and still have several months of supplies in storage.\u000a\u000aOrbital has a $1.9 billion (roughly Rs. 12,675 crores) contract with Nasa and SpaceX has a contract worth $1.6 billion (roughly Rs. 10,676 crores) to send food and equipment to the research lab over a series of supply trips.\u000a\u000aThursday's launch is Orbital's fourth scheduled mission to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aOrbital arranged to use United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket while it upgrades its Antares rocket, which failed due to a problem with its reconditioned Ukrainian engine.\u000a\u000aThe company said after the accident that a control operator detected a suspected rocket engine failure, and the rocket was purposefully detonated to prevent damage to people in the area.\u000a\u000aThe blast cost Orbital at least $200 million in lost equipment and supplies.\u000a\u000aThe cargo ship is packed with more supplies than a Cygnus has ever carried, amounting to some 7,300 pounds (3,300 kilograms), company officials said.\u000a\u000aSophisticated science experiments, ready-made food, a jet pack for spacewalking astronauts and even a satellite made by elementary school students are all on board.\u000a\u000aIf the launch goes ahead as planned Thursday, the spacecraft will arrive at the space station on December 6.

(File)\u000aNew Delhi:  Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain had a narrow escape after he was once again targeted in a slipper attack by a woman who claimed she was hurt by Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's remarks on India's anti-terror strikes across the Line of Control.\u000aBhavana Arora -- who claimed to belong to the Aam Aadmi Sena - hurled a piece of footwear at Mr Jain while he was outside the Income Tax office today afternoon. However, the slipper only hit the vehicle in which he - and also senior AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh - was travelling.\u000a"How could the Aam Aadmi Party demand proof of strikes by the Indian Army? They are behaving like Pakistani agents," Ms Arora said.\u000aThis is not the first time that Ms Arora has targeted senior AAP leaders. In January this year, she threw ink on Mr Kejriwal while he delivered a speech at a public meeting.\u000aVolunteers of the Aam Aami Sena also sloganeered and protested outside the Income Tax Headquarters in Delhi where Mr Jain was to arrive for questioning. He had been summoned by the Income Tax department as a witness in connection to an ongoing investigation against several Kolkata firms.\u000aMr Jain has denied any connection with the firms under investigation and said that he had ended his dealings with them some years ago.\u000a

Hindus touch the feet of elders as a mark of respect. When a guest visits your house and there is no running water as in villages, the guest is helped to wash his feet by pouring water. It is not considered as demeaning oneself. After all Lalu was a CM and probably older than the police officer, he had to wash his feet before entering the temple and the police officer poured water on his feet. The matter is too trivial to merit action against the policeman. Compare this with Sanjay Dutt reportedly being supplied alcohol in jail. \u000aIdaho Bucharest | 2 years agoReply | Permalink | Share | Report Abuse | Like  | Unlike  This is the country which wants the world to take its corrupt criminal diplomats seriously?

VDublin/New Delhi:  Sadness, anger and outrage ruled in the virtual world on the death of Indian woman Savita Halappanavar in an Ireland hospital after she was allegedly denied an abortion in the pro-life Catholic country.\u000aUnder the hashtags #RIPSavita and #legislateforX, twitterati voiced their outrage over the death of Savita last month.\u000aLeanneWoodfull posted: "I'm glad #Savita's story is spreading worldwide, Ireland needs to put in the spotlight for this monstrosity. #RIPSavita". ThisGodRocks tweeted: "It's so fundamentally wrong to place religious beliefs above saving a human life. Savita had a heartbeat too. "\u000aTwo probes have been ordered in Ireland into the death of Savita who was 17 weeks pregnant. Savita, 31, a dentist, presented with back pain at the University Hospital Galway on Oct 21.\u000aShe was found to be miscarrying, and died of septicaemia a week later.\u000aHer husband, Praveen Halappanavar, 34, an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, said the couple had asked the hospital several times to terminate the pregnancy after coming to know that she was miscarrying. This was refused, according to Praveen, because the foetal heartbeat was still present and they were told, "This is a Catholic country".\u000aShe spent another two and a half days "in agony" until the foetal heartbeat stopped. The dead foetus was removed and Savita was taken to the intensive care unit, where she died of septicaemia on October 28.\u000aSpeaking to Irish Times from Belgaum in Karnataka where he took his wife's body for the last rites, Praveen said the doctor had told them the baby wouldn't survive. His wife was in agony, and each time the doctor came on his rounds he would tell her "As long as there is a foetal heartbeat we can't do anything."\u000aIreland's constitution officially bans abortion, but a 1992 Supreme Court ruling found the procedure should be legalized for situations when the woman's life is at risk from continuing the pregnancy. However, five governments since then have refused to pass a law resolving the confusion.\u000aPro-choice protests have been planned outside the Dail, the Irish parliament, while others are planning a protest outside the Irish embassy in London.\u000aDearbhail McDonald, legal editor of the Irish Independent, in an article titled "We need legislation, we need it now" writes: "At heart, though, the underlying societal rage stems from the inexcusable failure by successive governments to clarify when women in Ireland can avail of medical abortions in the limited circumstances that our law permits since the landmark 1992 X case."\u000a"As a result of the X case, abortion is permissible in Ireland if it is established that there is a real and substantial risk to the life - as distinct from the health - of the mother which can be avoided only by the termination of the pregnancy."\u000a"But no government has ever introduced laws to give effect to the ruling and there is no means for any woman to clarify whether she qualifies for a medical termination under X."\u000aIreland's Minister for Health James Reilly has received the report of an expert group on the 1992 judgment.\u000aIreland Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he would not comment until "we are in possession of all of the facts".\u000aColette Browne tweeted: "Enda Kenny says to WAIT WAIT WAIT. Continue to WAIT for reports that should have been published months ago. Disgrace."\u000aAnother tweet went: "Dear Ireland, get your priorities right. Legislate for basic human rights & stop worrying about medieval religious beliefs."\u000aMauricegueret posted: "Now that Ireland has a prized seat on the UN Human Rights Council, it can spread its medieval misogyny worldwide".\u000aThe Womenscouncilireland posted: "The death of Savita Halappanavar is a national shame, sincere condolences to her husband and family."\u000aOther posts went: "20 years after X case, another pivotal day. Another tragedy for a family and a wake-up call for us all. Govt must legislate."\u000a"A woman's preventable death is the sad and shameful result of years of political and moral cowardice in Ireland."\u000aThe Indian government has voiced concern over the "tragic death" and said its embassy in Dublin is following the case.\u000a

VTrinamool Congress party supporters celebrate with gulal in front of the residence of Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on May 16, 2009. (AP)\u000aKolkata, Thiruvananthapuram:  It's the moment Mamata Banerjee had been waiting for her entire political career.\u000a"We really fought with our blood sweat and tears...we are in favour of both industry and agriculture," says the Trinamool chief.\u000aFrom 1 MP in 2004, Mamata's tally has shot up to 19. This is Left Front's worst showing in 32 years, losing 20 seats.\u000aSays CPM general secretary Prakash Karat: "We can't blame it on individual leaders. We will analyse the results and come up with a comprehensive picture."\u000aAt Alimuddin Street, headquarters of the CPM in West Bengal, there is now a desperate hunt for an answer to the question that has slammed into them today. Why this historic debacle.\u000aBiman Bose, chairman of Left Front in the state, talks about Trinamool riding the Congress wave. That may be a little simplistic. The CPM will certainly be introspecting on its policy on industry -- a policy that led it to try and acquire land at Singur and Nandigram with devastating consequences.\u000aThe first sign was losing the Ppanchayat elections last year in those hotspots. And its not just West Bengal, the party has been left out in its other stronghold, Kerala as well.\u000aThe infighting between the CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan and the chief minister lead to a huge loss of credibility.\u000aSays Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan: "Though we knew we could not register the record win we had in the last general elections, we expected a not-so-bad verdict. We will be able to say what went wrong only after a detailed analysis."\u000aHuge losses in both their bastions will mean a significantly reduced role for the Left on the national stage.\u000a

VParineeti Chopra, Arjun Rampal and Aditi Rao Hydari were among the celebrities who expressed their feeling for their mothers ahead of Mother's Day\u000aWith Mother's Day being celebrated on Sunday, some of Bollywood's well-known celebrities remember the memorable moments they spent with their mothers and feel they are not meant to be loved for just one day.\u000aHere is what they have to say:\u000aArjun Rampal: I want to travel with my mother around the world to all the destinations she would love. I want to tell her that if I were to be born again then I want to be born only as her child.She is the most beautiful and best mom in the world. \u000a Pooja Bhatt: I think it's time to discard the Mother's Day cliches and promise to mother her in the twilight of her life. All parents and children have to reverse roles eventually. That is the natural order of life!\u000aAditi Rao Hydari: My mother brought me up single handedly with strength and grace. I love her beyond measure and never cease to value the life she gave me, full of freedom, beauty, love and dignity.\u000aParineeti Chopra: My love for my mother is boundless. I want to take her for a trip to Switzerland as soon as I find the time.\u000aDivya Dutta: I want to thank my mother for giving me the freedom to be an actress when everyone wanted me to be a doctor like her. And I want to thank her for letting me take her for granted and for not judging me and loving me unconditionally. And most of all I love my mother for giving me the most comfortable place to forget my stress, her lap.\u000aAdnan Sami: There's no worldly gift worthy of a mother who has gifted me with life. There are no adequate words to thank my mother , nothing with which I say can express my gratitude for carrying me for 9 months before I was ready to face the world. Even now I crave to rush back to that safe haven.\u000aShabana Azmi: I just want to say three simple words to my mother: I love you. I am because she is.\u000aUrmila Matondkar: I can't thank my mother enough for making me the person I am.I am still learning from her every day. I want to gift her a medicine that would keep her illness-free forever. I want to see her healthy and beautiful forevever.\u000aDino Morea: For Mother's Day I'd want to again thank my mom for this beautiful life she has given me, and for my super upbringing. Thanks for being there for us brothers, no matter what. I'd like to gift her the world.\u000aMinissha Lamba: It's my mom who has made me what I am today. I want to thank her for all the love and attention that she poured into me to make me a good humanbeing.\u000aKalki Koechlin: My mother, the strong stubborn conscientious influence of my life.I'll get her something from Delhi where I'm shooting.\u000aMahaakshay Chakraborty: I'd like to tell my mom(former actress Yogeeta Bali) that she's truly the greatest mother in the world.I've seen many mothers. But none like her..She gave up her career to devote her life completely to her family and children. I'd love to take mom to the Wimbledon finals specially if Nadal is playing.\u000aDia Mirza: I am very proud of my mom.I AM because she IS.I am going to give her a Mother's Day filled with surprises.\u000aChitrangda Singh: The best gift for my mother I can think of is to take a holiday with her.And I should promise to call her three times a day every day. There is nothing she and I would like better.She is the most important person in my life.\u000aDarsheel Safary: I would like to wish her 'Happy Mothers Day' and thank her for supporting me in my school, acting work and whatever I do. I will give a card and chocolates.\u000a

VChennai:\u000aA section of employees of Hyundai Motor India's Sriperumbudur manufacturing plant continued their strike for the third consecutive day today, pressing their demand for reinstatement of 28 sacked staff.\u000aThe Korean auto major in a statement maintained that the stir did not hit work and production continued to be normal.\u000aA section of employees have been on strike since October 30.\u000aIncidentally, Hyundai's rival Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) was also hit by employee strike at its Manesar plant a few months ago in July. Since then, MSI has recovered and has posted robust growth of 85 per cent in total sales for October.\u000aThe Hyundai Motor India Employees Union, backed by the CITU, said over 800 employees struck work today. It further said that striking employees would stage an agitation from tomorrow near the factory premises insisting on their demand.\u000aThe company only 180 workers abstained from work and production continued to be normal.\u000a"Work at the two plants continued to be on schedule even as 180 workers abstained from work," a company statement said.\u000a"On Tuesday the company produced 2,054 cars, while on Wednesday the number rose to 2,157 despite 200 workers not showing up. Today we will produce 2176 cars," it said.\u000aPointing out that the company has already recognised United Union of Hyundai Employees (UUHE) as the official union, with a majority of 1,300 permanent workers, Hyundai stated that it will not recognise any other union.\u000aFurther, 400 employees who are not part of UUHE have signed and accepted a wage settlement, the statement said.\u000a"We want the the Labour Department officials to intervene and solve the issue...," a representative of the Union told PTI.\u000aHe reiterated that their demand was that the dismissed be taken back by the management.\u000aHe said the Police have given them permission to stage an agitation near the factory.\u000aHyundai Motor India has two manufacturing facilities at Sriperumbudur near Chennai, with a total capacity of over six lakh units.\u000aThe company had earlier had said the employees by staging the agitation inside the plant premises were violating the law.\u000a

VNew Delhi:\u000aDespite getting lukewarm response from the earlier two auctions, the government today said it is confident of meeting the revenue target of Rs. 40,000 crore from spectrum sale this fiscal.\u000a"We will exceed whatever is the budget provision for the receipt of money from auction for this year...Rs. 11,000 crore is the receipt (from the upcoming auction), what it means is the total amount will be much more than that...around Rs. 40,000 crore," Telecom Secretary MF Farooqui told reporters here.\u000aHe was addressing the media on the forthcoming India Telecom-2013 meet to be held from December 5-7 and inaugurated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\u000aMr Farooqui said the government is hopeful that the entire spectrum put on auction table would be sold out.\u000a"We are very confident that these auctions are going to be successful and we are very confident all the spectrum that is to be auctioned will be sold," Mr Farooqui said.\u000aThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had recommended up to 60 per cent cut in the auction reserve price for spectrum in the 900 MHz band in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata circles. It had also suggested 37 per cent cut in the reserve price for spectrum in the 1800 MHz band.\u000aHowever, Telecom Commission, the highest decision making body of Department of Telecom (DoT), had recommended raising reserve price of pan-India mobile phone spectrum by 15 per cent over the one suggested by Trai, and 25 per cent higher in case of key circles like Delhi and Mumbai.\u000aThe Empowered Group of Ministers has approved the price recommended by Telecom Commission.\u000aDoT is likely to conduct the third round of spectrum auction by January. The Government had set a total revenue target of Rs. 40,874.5 crore this fiscal from spectrum, including auction amount, one-time spectrum charge and annual regular licence fee.\u000aThe government had got Rs. 9,407.64 crore from the November auction last year and Rs. 3,639 crore from the March auction.\u000aMr Farooqui said that the merger and acquisition guidelines are also expected to be finalised before the auctions.\u000a

VYogendra Yadav said if the Delhi government adopts the 2014 Janlokpal draft, Swaraj Abhiyan would come to its defence.\u000aNew Delhi:  Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav today said that ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is indulging in "damage control" exercise by hinting to accept social activist Anna Hazare's suggestions on Janlokpal Bill. He said that he would "join celebrations" if the government passes the 2014 draft Bill in its entirety.\u000aMr Yadav said the demands to amend the sections governing the appointment and removal of the Lokpal would be wrong to be attributed to Anna Hazare alone as these were the basic demands of the Janlokpal movement.\u000a"Now that they have been caught red handed in an act of daylight robbery they need a fig leaf. So they are discovering certain things by going to Anna which we have been saying. It's a damage control exercise because they thought they would get away," Mr Yadav said.\u000aMr Yadav, who was expelled from AAP for "anti-party activities", said the argument being put by AAP not to include the provision of eminent persons in the selection panel was a "red herring".\u000a"What the Supreme Court said during the NJAC debate was that you cannot leave the category vague by saying eminent person but should put certain criteria. And the argument is completely rubbish as the word eminent persons was not used in the 2014 Bill or the IAC draft," he said.\u000aMr Yadav said if the government adopts the 2014 draft, Swaraj Abhiyan, a forum launched by him and Prashant Bhushan, would come to its defence and launch agitation against the Centre if obstacles are put.\u000aThe 2014 Bill had provisions to act against officials of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Delhi Police which Swaraj Abhiyan "accepts" but bringing Union Ministries under its ambit would be "ridiculous", Mr Yadav said, adding "someone should have a sense of the Constitution".\u000aUnder fire for tabling a "diluted" Bill, the Delhi government is likely to amend the draft Janlokpal legislation and will introduce two changes in the appointment and removal clauses as per Anna Hazare's suggestions.\u000aDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that he will "surely" effect the changes proposed by the veteran social actvist during a meeting with AAP leaders Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh at Ralegan Siddhi yesterday.\u000a

VA top Samsung executive said Wednesday that the South Korean electronics giant had no plans to follow Taiwanese firm HTC in seeking a settlement over its patent disputes with arch-rival Apple.\u000a\u000aSamsung and Apple are currently embroiled in patent lawsuits in 10 nations including the United States and Germany, accusing each other of stealing design and technology.\u000a\u000aHTC, which had been locked in similar suits with Apple around the world, announced Sunday that the two companies had reached a deal to end all outstanding litigation and sign a 10-year licensing agreement over patents.\u000a\u000a"We have no such intention," J.K. Shin, the head of Samsung Electronics' mobile unit, told reporters when asked if Samsung would seek a similar settlement.\u000a\u000aSamsung -- the world's top mobile and smartphone maker -- was ordered by a US jury in August to pay Apple $1.05 billion in damages for illegally copying iPhone and iPad features for its flagship Galaxy S smartphones.\u000a\u000aIt has appealed the ruling.\u000a\u000aSince then, two separate rulings by courts in Japan and the Netherlands have dismissed Apple's claims of patent infringement.\u000a\u000aShin also said Wednesday that Samsung expected fourth-quarter smartphone sales to be as strong as the third quarter, when its newest Galaxy S3 device became the world's top-selling smartphone.

VThe 180th birth anniversary of Carlos Juan Finlay, Cuban physician and scientist known for his work on the treatment of yellow fever, has been marked with a Google doodle.\u000a\u000aTuesday's Google doodle features a portrait sketch of Carlos Juan Finlay, along with a representative image of the mosquito Culex fasciatus, now known as Aedes aegypti and vegetation in a water body, the surroundings where it breeds. Finlay had said that the Culex mosquito could be "hypothetically considered as the agent of transmission of yellow fever," in 1881.\u000a\u000aBorn in Puerto Principe, now known as Camaguey, Cuba, on 3 December 1833 as Juan Carlos Finlay y Barres, Finlay attended Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1855. He pursued his education in Havana and in Paris, and later started practicing in Havana, where he settled.\u000a\u000aHe conducted research on yellow fever and its causes and origin. Yellow fever epidemics affected Cuba and particularly, Havana, leading to a large number of deaths. Carlos Juan Finlay authored 40 articles on the topic. Notably, he had also researched Cholera.\u000a\u000aIn 1881, Juan Finlay proposed that the Culex mosquito was the agent of transmission of yellow fever and that a mosquito stinging a victim of the disease could subsequently sting and infect a healthy person. His theory was not accepted widely, initially but was confirmed by Walter Reed in 1900. Finlay served as the chief health officer of Cuba from the years 1902 to 1909.\u000a\u000aA monument had been erected honouring Finlay in the municipality of Marianao, in the city of Havana, as well as near the bayfront in Panama City.\u000a\u000aFinlay was nominated seven times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine, but never won.\u000a\u000aHe died on 20 August 1915 in Havana, Cuba, due to a stroke said to be caused by severe brain seizures.\u005cu00A0\u000a\u000aFor more Google doodles , visit this page

VLK Advani added that Delhi voters were smart and would vote for the BJP.\u000aNew Delhi:  Senior BJP leader L.K. Advani on Sunday asserted that given the political scenario in Delhi, there was no scope for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\u000aThe Bharatiya Janata Party leader, in conversation with journalists, said: "There was a time when only one party got all the votes, but we gave the people an option and created a bi-polar political system. I don't think that there is scope for a third party now."\u000aThe AAP has made the Delhi assembly elections a three-way affair for the first time. Till now, the electoral battle here was always fought between the Congress and the BJP.\u000aAdvani added that Delhi voters were smart and would vote for the BJP.\u000a"The voters had not chosen us in the last elections, and we are to be blamed for that. But this time, things are different. The voters of Delhi are smart enough to figure out who is the better party," he said.\u000a"People will vote for us, and we will win in Delhi," he said.\u000a

VThese latest pictures are part of a sequence taken near New Horizons' closest approach to Pluto.\u000aWashington:  NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has returned the sharpest images ever of cratered, mountainous and glacial terrains on Pluto and the best close-ups of the mysterious system that humans may see for decades.\u000aThese latest pictures are part of a sequence taken near New Horizons' closest approach to Pluto, with resolutions of about 250-280 feet per pixel - revealing features less than half the size of a city block on Pluto's diverse surface.\u000a"These close-up images, showing the diversity of terrain on Pluto, demonstrate the power of our robotic planetary explorers to return intriguing data to scientists back here on planet Earth," said John Grunsfeld, former astronaut and associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.\u000a"New Horizons thrilled us during the July flyby with the first close images of Pluto, and as the spacecraft transmits the treasure trove of images in its onboard memory back to us, we continue to be amazed by what we see," he added.\u000aThese new images are six times better than the resolution of the global Pluto map New Horizons obtained.\u000aThe pictures trend from Pluto's jagged horizon about 800 km northwest of the informally named Sputnik Planum across the al-Idrisi mountains - over the shoreline of Sputnik and across its icy plains.\u000a"These new images give us a breathtaking, super-high resolution window into Pluto's geology," added New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern.\u000aNothing of this quality was available for Venus or Mars until decades after their first fly-bys.\u000a"Yet at Pluto we are there already - down among the craters, mountains and ice fields - less than five months after fly-by! The science we can do with these images is simply unbelievable," he added.\u000aThese new images are six times better than the resolution of the global Pluto map New Horizons obtained, and five times better than the best images of Pluto's cousin Triton, Neptune's large moon, obtained by Voyager 2 in 1989.\u000aMission scientists are expecting more imagery from this set over the next several days.\u000aEach week, the piano-sized New Horizons spacecraft transmits data stored on its digital recorders from its flight through the Pluto system on July 14 this year.\u000a

VBlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins could receive almost $55.6 million if the company is sold and he is ousted from the top job.\u000a\u000aHeins would receive $48 million in equity awards, based on the company's share price at the end of its latest fiscal year, according to a regulatory filing earlier this year. He would also get $7.5 million in compensation for his salary and bonus under the change of control provisions in his contract.\u000a\u000aThe company would pay $72,000 in benefits and retirement savings. The plan was approved by shareholders at its annual meeting on July 9.\u000a\u000aBlackBerry announced that a sale of the company was one option that would be considered under a strategic review of the company, which has lost market share to Apple and Android-based phones. The long-awaited debut of its new phones this year has failed to turn around the struggling smartphone maker.\u000a\u000aThe company's strategic review is being headed by Timothy Dattels, a BlackBerry director and a senior partner at TPG Capital, one of the world's largest private equity firms.\u000a\u000aFairfax Financial and its chief executive, Prem Watsa, which hold approximately 11 percent of BlackBerry, are considered among possible buyers.\u000a\u000aWatsa resigned from the BlackBerry board on Monday due to potential conflicts of interest.\u000a\u000aIf Heins were to be removed from his job at BlackBerry without a change of control, he would receive a package valued at $22 million, including $5.8 million in compensation for his salary and bonus, $72,000 in benefits and retirement savings and $16.1 million in equity awards.\u000a\u000aThe BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, had been the dominant smartphone for on-the-go business people and other consumers before Apple debuted the iPhone in 2007. In the years since, BlackBerry Ltd. has been hammered by competition from the iPhone as well as Android-based rivals.\u000a\u000aHeins was named CEO in January 2012, replacing co-founders and co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who stepped down after shareholders demanded a management shakeup.\u000a\u000aThis past January, BlackBerry unveiled new phones running a revamped operating system called BlackBerry 10 (Review) designed to better compete. But its market share continues to lag. IDC said last week BlackBerry has fallen to fourth place in global smartphone sales, now trailing Microsoft. BlackBerry also warned in June of future losses.\u000a\u000aCIBC analyst Todd Coupland suggested BlackBerry could be worth as much as $20 per share in a takeover, and that big technology companies as well as private equity firms could be interested.\u000a\u000aMike Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said Tuesday the stock is up on takeover speculation. He believes the company is worth $8 per share.

VKalki Koechlin photographed in Mumbai.\u000aBollywood actress Kalki Koechlin believes that cinema is a 'dominant' but not the only medium to change the mind set of people about women.\u000a"Cinema is a dominant but not the only means to change people's mind set about women," said Kalki.\u000aKalki, 32, who featured in Shonali Bose's Margarita, With a Straw, said, "There is no single source that can mobilise or change the thinking of an entire society. Various sources and different mediums appeal to different people just like Margarita, With a Straw would appeal to a certain section of society. And that is why we need to continue our struggle at all fronts and through all possible means." \u000a "We need hundred different types of people doing hundred different types of things in the work that they do at different levels at different places (to bring about the change). There will not be one magic moment, one magic video that is going to change the whole mind set," she added.\u000aAccording to Kalki, the definition of empowerment is also different.\u000a"Just because I might be more free since I come from a different background doesn't mean I am completely free. I still have my own struggles that I have to face on a daily basis. You are fighting some kind of a battle in every way," she said.

VA sexual assault survivor says Donald Trump's "locker room" talk normalizes violence against women (AP)\u000aNew London, Connecticut:  At Connecticut College, as at a growing number of campuses nationwide, students are encouraged to speak up if they hear remarks celebrating or condoning sexual aggression against women. In one training scenario, male students ask a peer if he really means it when he boasts of such conduct.\u000aSo when news broke that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, had bragged of groping women, and then trivialized it as "locker room talk," it felt to some students like a repudiation of their efforts.\u000a"It's shocking that someone of that status thinks that that's OK," said Greg Liautaud, a senior who works with the college's sexual assault prevention office. "It does make the work harder, because our goal here is to shift culture."\u000aTrump's caught-on-tape remarks about kissing women and grabbing their genitals are resonating deeply on campuses across the U.S. where sexual assault has been a long-standing problem. Many worried the comments, coupled with an apology that diminished their severity, could hinder efforts to educate youth when society too often brushes off abusive behavior as "boys being boys" or puts the blame on the victim.\u000aAt Connecticut College, the director of sexual violence prevention said the presidential contender's remarks likely would become fodder for small group discussions, as happened after a videotape surfaced of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice hitting his fiancee.\u000a"I hope that it doesn't set us back," Darcie Folsom said. "I hope it pushes us forward everywhere to know more work needs to be done."\u000aThe federal government, citing estimates that 1 in 5 women has been sexually assaulted while in college, has stepped up pressure on higher education institutions to improve their response to allegations of assault. More than 200 schools are under sexual violence investigations by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights ; noncompliance could lead to loss of federal funding.\u000aOther institutions have faced lawsuits by women claiming officials were indifferent or hostile when complaints were lodged. The University of Connecticut, for example, settled for $1.3 million with five students, including one who alleged a campus police officer told her "women have to just stop spreading their legs like peanut butter" or rape will keep happening.\u000aStanford University professor Michelle Dauber said Trump's comments worsen the problem by serving to minimize sexual assault. Dauber is pushing a recall campaign of the judge who sentenced former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman outside a fraternity house - a penalty widely criticized as too lenient. Turner was released last month after serving half that time.\u000a"The rage you are seeing from women is not solely or even principally directed at Trump," Dauber said. "It is at the institutions and leaders who are failing to take action and hold him accountable. ... Women are sick and tired. Enough is enough."\u000aAlison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus, hopes that the outrage turns into a "teachable moment" that bolsters on-campus efforts to combat assault and support survivors. "Talking about it as no big deal can normalize the behavior. We have to create a culture where victims and survivors are comfortable coming forward, and on a lot of campuses that hasn't happened."\u000aThat issue resonates deeply with Savannah Badalich. She's a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, and works part time with other colleges to increase awareness about sexual assault. At those sessions, she shares her personal story about being sexually assaulted during her sophomore year at UCLA and being too timid to report the incident.\u000a"If the potential president of the U.S. is saying this is OK, what's to say that sexual violence is going to be taken seriously and that survivors are going to be treated with any respect?" she said.\u000aWhitney Ralston, a University of Richmond junior who says she was raped, physically abused and stalked by a classmate, has been heartened by the strong negative reaction to Trump's comments. "This is a problem that needs to be addressed, and you can't just keep brushing it off as boys will be boys."\u000aRalston's alleged attacker accepted responsibility for violating the university's sexual misconduct policy, was ordered to stay away from her and told that further violations would result in suspension or expulsion. Ralston has filed a complaint with the DOE accusing the university of mishandling the case. Federal investigators are already looking into two other cases at the school for possible violations of Title IX, a broad statute that prohibits gender discrimination as well as sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\u000aThe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, is also under federal investigation for its alleged mishandling of sexual assaults on campus, and the Trump furor reverberated across the campus this week, as students and faculty prepared to mark Relationship Violence Awareness Month. A complaint filed in August with the DOE accuses school officials of discouraging one sex assault victim from going to the police and said school investigators failed to get photographs documenting her injuries.\u000aShira Malka Devorah, a 20-year-old senior who works at the UMBC Women's Center, has refrained from sharing Trump's comments on social media because she didn't want to upset assault survivors. But she was horrified by the candidate's comments, and even more so his justification that they were merely locker room banter.\u000a"Saying that it's OK to talk about things like this with your buddies and joke about hurting women and controlling women's bodies, it's reinforcing the notion that you have power over women ... that they're not human beings," Devorah said.\u000aAt Connecticut College, which has about 1,900 students, efforts have grown in recent years to fight sexual assault. Freshmen attend a mandatory orientation session on preventing sexual violence, speakers address the topic at panels for prospective students, and some 30 student volunteers promote a program that encourages students to see it as a collective responsibility to stop sexual assault. One of the overall aims is to teach people how and when to intervene through videos, role-playing and other exercises.\u000aTrump's remarks were on the minds of many students this week as guides led small groups on tours around the picturesque campus on the Thames River.\u000a"It undermines the progress that we've made," said junior Maggie Corey. "I think what he said only perpetuates the rape culture."\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VAll schools near Indo-Pak border were ordered to be shut since last Thursday. (Representational Image)\u000aChandigarh:  The Punjab government has ordered that schools in the border belt of the state would reopen from today.\u000a"All schools in border belt will open from Wednesday. These had been had been closed due to security reasons," Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema said on Tuesday.\u000aAll schools, which were situated within the border area of 10 km from the international border with Pakistan, had been ordered closed on Thursday last week following the Indian Army's surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) to destroy terror launch pads or staging areas.\u000a"This decision has been taken keeping in mind that the students are in the midst of the academic session and that their studies are being affected," Mr Cheema said.\u000aThe Punjab government, based on directions from the Union Home Ministry, has also ordered the evacuation of villages in the border districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran and Fazilka.\u000aThough thousands of people were evacuated, many refused to move out of their homes in the border villages, saying that they had to tend to their properties, crops and cattle.\u000aPunjab shares a 553-km long international border with Pakistan.\u000a

VSyrian President Bashar Assad has long been suspected of launching the chemical attack that killed hundreds\u000aGeneva:  A growing body of evidence collected by UN investigators points to the involvement of senior Syrian officials, including President Bashar Assad, in crimes against humanity and war crimes, the UN's top human rights official said on Monday.\u000aThe statement by Navi Pillay, who heads the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, adds to the pressure for quicker action on Syria ahead of a key peace conference planned for Geneva in January. The conference, brought on by combined UN, U.S. and Russian diplomacy, would for the first time bring the Assad government and opponents together for face-to-face negotiations.\u000a"As we look around the world at the end of 2013, we see examples of situations where that readiness of the international community to act in time is already being sorely tested," Pillay told a news conference that touched on trouble spots around the world.\u000a"In addition to Syria, where the scale and viciousness of the abuses being perpetrated by elements on both sides almost defies belief, the situation in the Central African Republic is deteriorating rapidly, and the alarm bells are ringing loud and clear."\u000aPillay said the Syrian abuses - suspected massacres, chemical attacks, torture, rape and a litany of other horrors - are being well documented by an expert UN panel of investigators.\u000a"They've produced massive evidence," she said. "They point to the fact that the evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state."\u000aSyrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad was dismissive of Pillay's remarks.\u000a"She has been talking nonsense for a long time and we don't listen to her," he told The Associated Press in The Hague.\u000aPillay said the lists of suspected criminals are handed to her on a confidential basis and will remain sealed until requested by international or national authorities for a "credible investigation," and then possibly used for prosecution.\u000aPillay said she worries about striking the right balance in determining how long to keep the information secret. The lists "rightly belongs to the people who suffered violations," she said, but they also must be kept sealed "to preserve the presumption of innocence" until proper judicial probes can be done that could lead to trial.\u000aAny prosecution before the International Criminal Court at The Hague appears to be a long way off because Syria is not a member of the court, so it would the UN Security Council to refer the matter. The 15-nation Council did so once before in the case of Sudan, in 2005, but would be unlikely to do so in Syria's case because its key ally Russia is one of the council's five permanent members that wield a veto.\u000aPillay and the four-member UN panel on Syria war crimes chaired by Brazilian diplomat and scholar Paulo Sergio Pinheiro has previously said Assad's government and supporters and the rebels who oppose them have committed heinous war crimes during the nearly 3-year-old civil war in Syria that has killed more than 100,000 people.\u000aBut this time, Pillay specifically referred to the president - though she was careful to say she hadn't singled him out as a possible suspect on the secret lists.\u000aPillay said Syria and North Korea - the two countries being probed by a UN investigative panel - represent two of the world's worst human rights violations, but she also cited concerns with Central African Republic, Bangladesh and other regions.\u000aOther places that require the world's attention, she said, are the large-scale expulsions of migrants from Saudi Arabia, the high number of migrant laborer deaths building World Cup stadiums in Qatar, and continuing political exploitation of xenophobia and racism in Europe and other developed regions.\u000a

VKolkata:  Just a few hours before Narendra Modi flew into Kolkata to keep his date with Industry, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee left town. Her political rival, the Left, sniggered and said the West Bengal Chief Minister is "shy of meeting Modi."\u000aThis morning as he visited the famous Dakshineshwar temple, the Gujarat Chief Minister smiled and waved, much at home. At his meeting with business leaders he will talk about growth in Gujarat and will pitch his state as an investment destination.\u000aThe BJP says it expects a full house - a 1000 cards were distributed, the organisers said. But some top names will not be there. Industry leaders like Sanjeev Goenka of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, Harsh Neotia of the Ambuja Neotia group and Sanjay Budhia of the PATTON Group, are out of town. There is speculation that they are skipping the Modi interaction as they do not want to upset the mercurial Mamata Banerjee, but the organisers insist their absence is just a coincidence.\u000aBengal's industrialists have only now begun warming up to Ms Banerjee, but not enough yet to invest in her state. Narendra Modi on the other hand is a super hit with corporate India.\u000aThis tale of two chief ministers has complex dynamics. Mamata Banerjee's biggest run-in with Industry - the Singur protests which forced Tata Motors to shift their Nano plant out of Bengal - became Mr Modi's triumph when he successfully invited Ratan Tata to set up his plant in Gujarat instead. Ms Banerjee also acquired from the Singur incident a reputation for being anti-Industry, which she has attempted to shake off desperately ever since she became the chief minister of a state deep in debt and crying for investment.\u000aShe is in Delhi today to seek financial help from the Centre. (Mamata to meet PM today to seek 'economic justice' for Bengal)\u000aThe BJP in Bengal says Ms Banerjee's government has not made it easy to welcome Mr Modi to Kolkata. The party had tried to book a stadium that seats 12,000 people for a reception, but could not get the venue. When the BJP wrote to Ms Banerjee to help, it says she refused.\u000a

VNarendra Modi used Pranab Mukherjee to target the Gandhis in Kolkata rally\u000aNew Delhi:  Narendra Modi today courted a massive crowd in Bengal dropping names of their most beloved icons, not stopping at using even Pranab Mukherjee to target the Congress and Sonia Gandhi.\u000aThe Congress and the Gandhi family had twice denied Pranab Mukherjee the post of Prime Minister, said Mr Modi, the BJP's prime ministerial candidate. "The people of Bengal should not forget this. I request you," he urged, addressing his first rally in Kolkata ahead of the national election, due by May.\u000aThe Congress instantly hit back. "It's unfortunate that the CM of Gujarat is dragging in the august office of the President of India into controversy," said union minister Manish Tewari.\u000aMr Modi said Mr Mukherjee, who became President nearly two years ago, deserved to be the country's Prime Minister in 1984 or 2004.\u000a"When Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Rajiv Gandhi was in Kolkata and he went back. Under a democracy, that time the senior-most minister in Indira Gandhi's government was Pranab\u000a Mukherjee. It would have been good if he had been sworn in as the country's prime minister," he said.\u000a"They didn't give it. Not only that, the family (Gandhis) felt that something is going on. So when the Rajiv Gandhi government was formed, senior-most minister Pranabda was not even made a minister."\u000aThe next slight, he said, came in 2004, when the Congress returned to power.\u000a"Again in 2004, Pranabda was the senior-most politician. It was very natural that if madam Sonia Gandhi did not want to become (the PM), then the opportunity should have been given to Pranabda, but Manmohan Singhji was made (the PM). Pranabda was not given the opportunity."\u000aMr Modi, who peppered his speech with Bangla quotes, told the crowd that if they elected his party in all 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, they would enjoy triple benefit. "Mamatadi will bring change here. I will bring you development from Delhi. And then you have Pranabda as President."\u000a

VGuwahati:  On Thursday, a blast on a railway track in Assam's Shibsagar district disrupted railway traffic. However, there were no casualties in the incident.\u000aThree long-haul trains - the Kamrup Express, Delhi-Guwahati Rajdhani and Intercity - were stopped at various stations as a precautionary measure.\u000aConfirming the incident, Northeast Frontier Railway's (NFR) Chief Public Relations Officer, S Hajong, said the explosion took place on railway tracks between Bhojo and Longpotia station in the district.\u000a"There is no human casualty. Some portions of the track are damaged due to the blast and we have halted the trains, which are supposed to pass by the area, at nearby stations. Movement of the trains will be affected till the tracks are restored. We are hopeful that the restoration works of the tracks will be done soon," said Hajong.\u000aThe blast occurred just after a pilot engine passed Sibsagar district. The Railways has sent rescue and restoration teams.\u000aThe blast came a day before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to the state. The banned militant organisation United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) had issued a threat ahead of the PM's visit. (Read: High security in Assam for PM's visit)\u000aMeanwhile, IANS reports security forces deployed in Lower Assam's Chirang district, on Thursday, recovered an improvised explosive device (IED) from the railway tracks.

VJerusalem:  Israel's military says soldiers shot at Syrian fighters after gunfire from the Syrian civil war spilled over to the Israel-controlled Golan Heights.\u000aA military spokesman said soldiers deployed artillery toward the source of fire late Saturday night.\u000aSpeaking on condition of anonymity according to protocol, the spokesman said it identified a hit. He did not know if they were Syrian rebels or forces loyal to President Bashar Assad.\u000aSyrian shells have exploded inside the Golan Heights several times in recent weeks damaging apple orchards, sparking fires and spreading panic but causing no injuries. Israel is worried that if Assad is toppled, Syria could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists or descends into sectarian warfare.\u000a

VSince 2014 we have been hearing about Google working on smart contact lenses for users. As it turns out, Samsung too since 2014 has been interested in the same field and might as well be already working on it, according to a recently granted patent. What's different here is that while Google was only working on smart contact lenses for medical monitoring purposes, Samsung patent suggests its smart contact lenses will also feature a built-in camera.\u000a\u000aThe South Korean tech giant's smart contact lens, as per the patent (via Sammobile) is supposed to project images on to the user's eyes via a tiny display and take photographs wirelessly that the wearer can view in their connected smartphones. The 29-page patent published by Kipris (Korean Intellectual Property Rights Informative Service) was filed by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. back in 2014, same year when Google started working on its own smart lenses. The Samsung lenses are also said to detect eye movements and sensor inputs as and when the user blinks.\u000a\u000aThe translated abstract suggests the smart lenses are made to brings augmented reality closer to the masses in the most easiest form. However, as with all patents it is not necessary that the company granted the patent will use the technology in an actual production device. So, while we may never see Samsung bring the smart lenses with camera, we at least know the technologies the company is exploring.\u000a\u000aIn February, another patent hinted Samsung to be working on a future smartwatch that could use our veins for identity verification. In the patent, the company describes a method to identify users that takes a scan of the registered user's vein layout, and then compares it to the layout of the person trying to authenticate themselves in the future.

VSyrians look at the aftermath of an airstrike on a rebel area of the war-torn northern city of Aleppo on December 15, 2013.\u000aDamascus:  The Syrian air force was today accused of killing 76 people by unleashing barrels packed with explosives on Aleppo, a focal point for fighting between regime and rebel forces.\u000aThe bombardment, which activists described as "unprecedented", came as the United Nations said the number of Syrian war refugees in the Middle East was likely to double to 4.1 million by the end of 2014.\u000aThe number of people slain in yesterday's bombing of Aleppo "with explosive-packed barrels... rose to 76," including "28 children and four women," said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, updating its previous toll of 36 dead.\u000aObservatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said it was "one of the heaviest tolls from air raids since the beginning of the war" that flared after a brutal regime crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired democracy protests that erupted in March 2011.\u000aExplosive-laden barrels were dropped on six rebel-controlled districts in the east, including Sakhur, Ard al-Hamra and Haydariyeh, Abdel Rahman said.\u000aThe Observatory and activists said government forces frequently drop the barrels filled with TNT on rebel-held areas of the war-torn country from helicopters and warplanes.\u000a"The barrels of explosives are not like bombs. Their impact is not accurate as they are dropped without any guidance system, and that is why they cause a large number of victims," said Abdel Rahman.\u000aThe devices are made up of metal barrels that have a layer of concrete inside them "so that they cause as much destruction and death as possible," according to Abdel Rahman.\u000aThere are two types of barrel bombs, one of which is home-made, and the other of which is made in factories.\u000aA Syrian security official said the army prefers the TNT-packed barrels because they are cheaper than regular bombs, which need to be imported from Russia.\u000aThe Aleppo Media Centre, a network of activists on the ground, called yesterday's raids on the northern city "unprecedented".\u000a"Everyone is looking up at the skies and watching the planes. But there's nothing to be done," AMC activist Mohammed al-Khatieb said.\u000aAleppo, Syria's second city and pre-war commercial hub, is now divided between areas occupied by troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and rebel fighters.\u000aFighting that erupted with a rebel offensive in July last year has caused massive damage to the historic city.\u000aActivists posted video footage online of the aftermath of yesterday's barrel bomb attacks, showing bulldozers clearing rubble from the streets as men searched for survivors in wrecked buildings.\u000aThe barrel bombings came as Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom prepared to brief the United Nations Security Council on the use of internationally-banned chemical weapons in the unrelenting war.\u000a

But when he saw it, he refused to drive it. He was a little scared because he had never driven such a big vehicle before. But, we had no other option since he plays the character of a truck driver," director Sunil Advani said in a statement.\u000a"But, then we were able to persuade him and he drove the truck with the ease of an expert," he added. \u000a The film is based on Ruskin Bond's story The Running Away. It's a fun-filled children's film peppered with unexpected adventures of two runaways, subtly underscoring the balanced view between discipline and freedom.\u000aThe film also features Saksham Kulkarni, Sonu Bakshi, Jackie Shroff, Urmila Matondkar and Boman Irani, among many more.

VAbu Dhabi:\u000aTalk about some serious legroom.\u000aEtihad Airways, a fast-growing Mideast carrier, laid out plans Sunday to offer passengers who find first-class seats a bit too tight a miniature suite featuring a closed-off bedroom, private bathroom and a dedicated butler.\u000aIt is the latest salvo in the worldwide battle among airlines for well-heeled customers. Their willingness to spend big on premium seats can make a big difference to an airline's bottom line.\u000aThe Abu Dhabi-based carrier revealed the front-of-plane amenities as part of a broader rollout of plush new cabin offerings for dozens of long-range jetliners it plans to receive over the coming years.\u000aEtihad Chief Executive James Hogan conceded that offering what the airline says is the first-of-its-kind multi-room suite helps generate buzz, but that ultimately it is a serious effort to bring in more cash. The carrier already woos the flying elite with perks including first-class onboard chefs and in-flight nannies.\u000a"Obviously there's going to be a halo effect in the positioning of Etihad Air as a premium carrier," he said. "But we wouldn't do it unless we felt we could make money with it. ... This is a top-end market. There is demand here."\u000aEtihad is the smallest of three rapidly expanding, government-backed Gulf carriers redrawing global aviation maps by funneling travelers through their desert hubs.\u000aIts base in the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi, this year became the first in the Mideast to open a U.S. preclearance facility staffed by American customs and border officials. U.S. pilots and members of Congress have criticized the facility, which is largely funded by the UAE, alleging it puts American carriers at a disadvantage.\u000aSince starting operations in 2003, Etihad has built a fleet of 96 planes. It carried 11.5 million passengers and posted a profit of $62 million last year.\u000aIt has ordered more than 220 additional planes, including 10 Airbus A380s and 71 Boeing 787s being outfitted with new interiors introduced Sunday.\u000aAmong the promised amenities for those aircraft are 11-inch seatback TV screens in economy, a "lobby" on the A380s featuring a semi-circular leather couch and bar area for first and business class passengers, and prayer areas for Muslim passengers that can be curtained off and have an electronic indicator pointing the way to Mecca.\u000aEtihad has been aggressively building stakes in foreign carriers, including Virgin Australia and Germany's second largest airline Air Berlin. It has for months been considering buying a piece of struggling Italian carrier Alitalia. Hogan had no comment on those negotiations Sunday.\u000aIts bigger rival Emirates, based in nearby Dubai, has offered onboard showers to first-class passengers aboard its double-decker Airbus A380s since the plane joined the fleet in 2008. It also separates coach passengers from those in business and first class on an entirely different floor in its dedicated concourse in Dubai.\u000aEtihad's latest offering goes one step further.\u000aOne passenger - or a couple - aboard each of its new A380s will be able to book a three-section miniature suite that the airline is calling a "residence" at the very front of the plane's upper deck.\u000aThe 125-square-foot (11.61-square-meter) area includes a "living room" partitioned off from the first-class aisle that includes leather seating, chilled minibar and a 32-inch flat-screen TV. There is a separate bedroom with space for two that can be closed off from the rest of the cabin and a private bathroom with shower.\u000aA white-gloved personal butler trained in London will be on hand to wait on passengers in the suite, giving them what the airline promises will be "discrete personal service and attention to detail found in the world's most exclusive hotels."\u000aEtihad expects to get its first of its A380s in December, which it will deploy on the Abu Dhabi to London route.\u000aAdditional A380s will likely be deployed on New York and Sydney routes as they're added to the fleet, Chief Commercial Officer Peter Baumgartner said.\u000aThe fancy new suite won't come cheap.\u000aBaumgartner said it will likely cost three to four times as much as regular first-class seats, or about $21,000 (Rs. 12.6 lakh) from Abu Dhabi to London. One way.\u000a(1$ = 60 rupees)\u000a

VThe opposition wants action against Minister Ram Shankar Katheria for inflammatory speech\u000aNew Delhi: \u000aHighlights\u000aUnion minister Ram Shankar Katheria faces anger in Parliament over his inflammatory comments at a public meeting in Agra in Uttar Pradesh. There were repeated disruptions as both houses assembled a day after the Budget.\u000aThe opposition Congress has moved both houses for a discussion on the comments.\u000aOn Sunday, Mr Katheria had allegedly said at a prayer meeting for murdered Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist Arun Mahaur: "All of this that is happening to the youth in this country, the conspiracies against the Hindu community...We will have to get strong and fight this conflict...Today, one Arun has died, tomorrow another Arun will die...before the second Arun dies (his) killers should go."\u000aMr Katheria, the Minister of State for Education, today denied saying anything controversial.\u000a"What has been published in newspapers as my speech is completely wrong. I didn't name any community. I only said the killers should be hanged," he said today.\u000aBesides Mr Katheria, several others also allegedly made controversial speeches. Among them was Chaudhary Babu Lal, BJP's lawmaker from Fatehpur Sikri, who allegedly spoke of "warning Muslims about the strength of Hindus."\u000aThe opposition has demanded Mr Katheria's resignation.\u000a"The prime minister (Narendra Modi) should sack the minister for making such inflammatory remarks," said Samajwadi Party's Ram Gopal Yadav.\u000aMr Katheria had yesterday defended what he said. "Arun Mahaur was murdered in broad daylight while returning from a prayer. He was murdered because he used to work against two taskhars (smugglers) and was the vice president of the VHP. There is too much anger among the Hindu community and that is why these protests have taken place. The protests will continue until we get justice. "\u000aMr Mahaur was shot dead last week allegedly by a man named Shahrukh.\u000a

VIndian Premier Manmohan Singh said Thursday the eurozone crisis was hurting the global economy as German leader Angela Merkel said the bloc didn't want to be a "source of irritation" for the world.\u000aDr Singh and the German chancellor were speaking after a meeting of their key cabinet members that sought to boost trade and investment ties between Europe's biggest economy and the South Asian population giant.\u000aThe Indian prime minister said the two had discussed the debt woes and recession that have hit members of the 17-nation currency union.\u000a"We want the eurozone to prosper and get out of this atmosphere of crisis because the eurozone countries are a most important component of the development of the global economy," said Dr Singh.\u000a"And a strong, resilient eurozone is in the interest of all countries of the world," he said, singling out developing countries.\u000a"We want the multilateral trading system to remain strong, and it cannot remain strong if there is trouble in any important constituent of the global economy such as the eurozone."\u000aHe added that the strength of Germany and Merkel's commitment to the eurozone "gives me confidence that Europe's crisis atmosphere will be effectively tackled in months to come."\u000aMerkel gave an upbeat assessment of the economic outlook for Germany.\u000a"I believe that we stand a good chance of levelling out the slight contraction we witnessed last year," she said. "But of course the situation dominating the eurozone is of greatest importance to the rest of the world."\u000aShe thanked Dr Singh "for underlining the need that we have to do what we can in order to create further growth, not only by investing money but also by carrying out necessary structural reforms".\u000a"What we need to develop is a common understanding of what creates growth and how we can generate growth," she said, with an eye to bitter differences within Europe between Germany's austerity-driven course and calls for greater public investment in economic development.\u000a"India has been carefully watching what is happening in the eurozone because it is aware of the consequences that developments in the eurozone have on the rest of the world.\u000a"We for our part have to make sure that the system works and doesn't create a continuous source of irritation for the rest of the world."\u000a

VKhoi Ratta, Pakistan:  A Pakistani couple who killed their teenage daughter by dousing her in acid spoke on Tuesday of their sadness and regret at the attack which they said they carried out to protect family "honour".\u000aThe parents poured acid over 15-year-old Anusha at their home last Monday after seeing her looking at boys. The girl died two days later after suffering 70 percent burns, according to doctors.\u000aSo-called "honour" attacks are common in deeply conservative Pakistan. Rights activists say more than 900 women were murdered last year after being accused of bringing shame on the family in some way.\u000aBoth parents have been arrested and Anusha's mother Zaheen Akhtar, 42, speaking from her police cell in Khoi Ratta, around 140 kilometres (85 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the main city in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said she feared for the future of the rest of her children.\u000a"I deeply regret my action. I am repenting as I should not have done this. She was very innocent. I feel like killing all my kids," the mother of eight told AFP.\u000a"My remaining children, including four girls and two boys, all under 10 years of age have been left alone and they have nobody out there except Allah the almighty to look after them," she said.\u000aAkhtar said she and husband Mohammad Zafar feared Anusha would follow in the footsteps of her elder sister who they married off at 16 "because people had been talking about her bad character" and who had cut off contact after moving to Karachi with her husband.\u000aHouse painter Zafar, 53, said he brought Anusha inside to beat her after seeing her looking at two boys outside the family home, but now he was haunted by memories of the attack.\u000a"We were upset by (the) character of our elder daughter and feared that Anusha might follow (in) her footprints," he said.\u000a"Anusha's mother should not have done this. I cannot sleep and whenever I shut my eyes, I see Anusha's burnt face."\u000aThe parents waited two days to take Anusha to hospital, but Zafar insisted this was simply because they could not afford to take her until a local doctor gave him some money.\u000a

VImage credit: Istock\u000aMore than five million people will die from a frightening cause: breathing\u000aDo you sometimes find yourself losing focus on the job? Is your thinking a little fuzzy? It could be something in the air - and you and your co-workers may be the source.\u000aWe all know that excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is bad. It's a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, though it has no immediate harmful effects on people in concentrations that occur outdoors. Until recently, experts believed that indoor carbon dioxide -- which is emitted, for example, when people exhale -- also was harmless except at extremely high levels of 5,000 parts per million (ppm) or more.\u000aNew research, however, has prompted scientists to rethink this assumption.\u000aTwo studies, one published in 2012 and another last fall, suggest that indoor exposure to carbon dioxide can impair performance and decision-making. Although the research focused on workers, the findings pose troubling questions for people in many indoor environments, including schools, airplanes, autos and even homes.\u000a"We spend 90 percent of our time indoors,'' says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure assessment science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, lead author of the most recent study. "To get a sense of this, multiply your age by 0.9. That's how many years you have spent indoors.''\u000aUntil now, research used CO2 measurements as a rough indicator of overall ventilation in buildings. Low ventilation rates allow concentrations of many pollutants -- including CO2 -- to build up, which experts have blamed for illnesses. This new research, however, suggests that even carbon dioxide may be causing problems.\u000a"Does this mean that kids in a crowded and poorly ventilated classroom have impaired decision-making? Does it mean that kids taking a high-stakes test like the SAT might be impaired? We don't know,'' says Mark Mendell, one of the authors of the 2012 study, which was conducted by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. "But the results for the first time raise this question.''\u000aThe Berkeley Lab scientists decided to conduct their study after coming across two small Hungarian studies suggesting that indoor CO2 was harmful at levels lower than 5,000 ppm.\u000aOn nine scales of decision-making performance, participants in the Berkeley study showed significant reductions on six scales at CO2 levels of 1,000 ppm and large reductions on seven at 2,500 ppm. The most dramatic declines in performance, in which subjects were rated as "dysfunctional," were for taking initiative and thinking strategically.\u000aThe Berkeley researchers, initially skeptical of the Hungarian studies, were flabbergasted by their findings. "We found astonishing, unbelievable effects with CO2 levels that were not that high,'' Mendell says. "Our study suggested that even at 1,000 ppm there were some adverse effects on decision-making, and 2,500 produced 'dysfunctional' performance.''\u000aOutdoor concentrations of CO2 in the air are around 400 ppm. Building operators have long tried to keep levels below 1,000 -- as an indication of adequate general ventilation, not because they had concerns about CO2 itself. But concentrations often exceed that, especially in crowded rooms with poor ventilation, Mendell says. Indoor levels can reach several thousand parts per million, according to the Berkeley scientists, with concentrations in classrooms occasionally exceeding 3,000 ppm.\u000aIllnesses apparently related to tight, energy-efficient new buildings received increasing attention beginning in the 1970s, with the emergence of "sick building syndrome," a cluster of symptoms that include headaches, respiratory symptoms and difficulty concentrating. Experts identified indoor air pollutants as the likely source, but they didn't suspect that carbon dioxide was part of the problem.\u000aThe Harvard study, which also involved researchers from SUNY Upstate Medical Center and Syracuse University, used similar testing methods as the Berkeley study, but it monitored participants over a longer period. It confirmed the 2012 results.\u000aTwenty-four participants - architects, designers, programmers, engineers, creative marketing professionals and managers -- spent six full workdays in an environmentally controlled office space, blinded to test conditions. All were exposed to the same conditions which varied each day.\u000aThe researchers studied the effects of different concentrations of air pollutants, including carbon dioxide. They also looked at performance under high and low rates of ventilation.\u000aThe subjects used a computer interface to make decisions about situations that match real-world challenges, from relatively simple tasks to highly complex problems.\u000aOn average, cognitive scores were 61 percent higher on days with low concentrations of pollutants, compared with the same participants' scores when they spent time in a low-ventilation environment with elevated levels of pollutants, and 101 percent better on days with the most ventilation. In fact, participants scored highest in eight of nine test areas on the days with the greatest ventilation.\u000aFor seven of the nine areas of productive decision-making, the average scores decreased as the level of carbon dioxide grew higher. Compared with the two days of high ventilation, cognitive function scores were 15 percent lower on the day with moderate CO2 -- about 945 ppm -- and 50 percent lower on the day with CO2 concentrations around 1,400 ppm.\u000aWorrisome, to be sure -- but probably fixable. "There are things we can do, right now, to enhance indoor environmental quality and benefit human health, well-being and productivity,'' Allen says. "This research has reinvigorated discussions with industry professionals on creating healthy indoor environments. People want buildings that make them healthy.''\u000aThe most obvious solution is to increase ventilation from the outside. But this will prove problematic if carbon dioxide levels continue to rise in the atmosphere. Also, it can be expensive: Outside air that comes inside must be warmed in the winter and cooled in the summer.\u000aA recent paper by Allen and colleagues suggests that spending money to increase ventilation in office buildings would be very cost-effective for employers, estimating the cost of doubling indoor ventilation rates at $40 per person annually, against a productivity gain of $6,500 per person per year.\u000a"The increased use of energy may be worthwhile, if it turns out to have important benefits for people in the workplace or the classroom, allowing them to think or perform better,'' Mendell says.\u000a© 2015 The Washington Post\u000a(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\u000a

VThe 5,000-year-old bronze statue 'Dancing Girl' was discovered in 1926 from Mohenjodaro, Indus Valley\u000aIslamabad:  A Pakistani lawyer has filed a petition to ask the government to claim a 5,000-year-old bronze statue called 'Dancing Girl' from India.\u000aBarrister Javed Iqbal Jaffrey filed the petition in the Lahore High Court on Monday.\u000aThe 10.5-centimetre-high statue, dating back to around 2500 BC, was discovered in 1926 from Mohenjodaro - the ancient city of the Indus Valley Civilisation in Sindh.\u000aThe petitioner claimed that the statue is the property of the Lahore Museum.\u000a"It was taken to India around 60 years ago at the request of the National Arts Council, Delhi, and was never brought back," a report in Pakistani newspaper Dawn claimed.\u000aJamal Shah, director general of the Pakistan National Museum of Arts, in a statement said that a letter would be written to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to bring the statue back.\u000a"This is important if we want to protect our heritage," Mr Shah said.\u000aMr Jaffrey says the statue has the same historic importance as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa in Europe. He calls it a marker of Pakistan's cultural heritage which needs to be protected.\u000aSome of the most famous archaeologists in the world have described it as one of the most captivating pieces of art from the Indus Valley site.\u000aThe tiny bronze statue of a young woman is suggestive of two breakthroughs - that Indus artists knew metal blending and casting and that the well developed Indus society had innovated dance and other performing arts, India's National Museum said in its description of the Dancing Girl.\u000a

VTo the many people who crossed his path on a tropical island in Belize, it was apparent John McAfee's life had taken some bizarre turns in the last few years.\u000a\u000aThe anti-virus software guru, who started McAfee Associates in 1989, has been in hiding since police said they wanted to question him about the weekend murder of his neighbor, fellow American Gregory Faull, with whom McAfee had quarreled.\u000a\u000aDespite his disappearance, McAfee, 67, has remained in contact with the media, providing a stream of colorful bulletins over his predicament, state of mind and his claim that Belize's authorities want to kill him.\u000a\u000aResidents of the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye and others who know him paint the picture of an eccentric, impulsive man who gave up a career as a successful entrepreneur in the United States for a life of semi-seclusion in the former pirate haven of Belize, surrounded by bodyguards and young women.\u000a\u000aMcAfee, a yoga fan who has lived on the island for about four years, often moves around with bodyguards and sticks pistols in his belt.\u000a\u000a"Never mind the dog, beware of owner," counsels a small sign, embellished with a sketched hand gripping a large pistol, tacked to the fence separating McAfee's beachfront swimming pool from the pier that cuts into the azure sea.\u000a\u000aOfficials suspect he used designer drugs, and neighbors say McAfee tried to chase them off the public beach in front of his house. Inside his home, a blue-roofed cottage complex, he kept a small arsenal of shotguns and scope-fitted rifles.\u000a\u000aThere were also complaints about the millionaire's numerous and noisy dogs. Officials say the poisoning of four of the dogs may be linked to the murder of Faull, a 52-year-old Florida building contractor who was shot dead at his salmon-hued two-story villa about 100 yards (meters) down the beach from McAfee.\u000a\u000aFaull was one of the locals who had complained about McAfee's attitude and his dogs.\u000a\u000aNow on the run, McAfee told Wired magazine, with whom he has kept an ongoing conversation, that he was disguised and holed up in what he describes as a lice-infested refuge.\u000a\u000aIn comments to the magazine, McAfee denied he shot Faull and said he fears that the police will kill or torture him. Police say they just want to talk to him about the killing.\u000a\u000aMcAfee, who has not responded to requests for comment by Reuters, blamed Belize's "pirate culture" for his troubles in an essay Wired said he had sent to the magazine.\u000a\u000a"Belize is still a pirate haven and is run more or less along the lines established centuries ago by the likes of Captain Morgan, Blackbeard and Captain Barrow," McAfee said.\u000a\u000aBelize Prime Minister Dean Barrow has urged McAfee to help police with their inquiries, calling him "bonkers."\u000a\u000a'Paranoid' Many locals in San Pedro describe the tattooed McAfee, who made a fortune developing the Internet anti-virus software that bears his name, as a generous but unstable man.\u000a\u000a"He's a good guy, he helped a lot of people. The problem was when he wanted something he wanted it right now. And when he didn't get it, he'd get paranoid," said one islander, a former McAfee employee, who like many people here spoke on condition their name not be used for fear of retribution.\u000a\u000a"He's a complex man, very impulsive," the islander added.\u000a\u000aDoug Singh, Belize's former police minister, told Reuters he was at a loss to explain McAfee's recent comments.\u000a\u000a"Mr. McAfee seems to have a bit of a divorce from reality and it seems to be consistent in his behavior and some of the things he has said recently. He's way out of line and out of proportion," he said. "Nobody has anything against Mr. McAfee."\u000a\u000aAfter making millions with his anti-virus product, McAfee decided to abandon the United States for Belize, a languid coastal paradise. It is a path that has been taken by a number of rich Americans over the years.\u000a\u000aHe took a beachfront compound on the island's isolated and exclusive north side, 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the town of San Pedro by boat or by driving over badly cratered asphalt and dirt track. It is a world away from California's Silicon Valley, which he once called home.\u000a\u000aHe took the company public in 1992 and left two years later following accusations that he had hyped the arrival of a virus known as Michelangelo, which turned out to be a dud, to scare computer users into buying his company's products.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the company he created and its parent, Intel, have declined to comment on the controversy.\u000a\u000aBut one long-time McAfee manager who recently left said company executives were likely monitoring the news closely. He said they have tracked reports of John McAfee's activities over the years out of concern they might need to do damage control.\u000a\u000aA case is already pending in Belize against McAfee for possession of illegal firearms, and police previously suspected him of running a lab to make illicit synthetic drugs.\u000a\u000aBut McAfee said this week he was opposed to drugs.\u000a\u000a"My life is fucked up enough without drugs, and always has been," McAfee told Wired magazine.\u000a\u000aBenefactor For all his trouble with authorities, McAfee has worked hard to be the island's benefactor. Upon arriving in Belize he bought a $1 million boat for the country's new coast guard, and donated equipment to the local police force, according to local reports.\u000a\u000aHe tipped generously everywhere he went, and hired a steady stream of taxis for frequent female guests on the $150 round trip from the small airstrip in San Pedro out to his house.\u000a\u000a"Not two or three, a lot of women," said Artemio Awayo, 24, a local waiter. "Every time I saw him it was a different woman."\u000a\u000aThose who knew him said he didn't drink and never hung out at the island's many bars. But employees at a restaurant near the pier where McAfee's water taxi company is based said his actions grew more bizarre following a police raid last April on his mainland hacienda outside the town of Orange Walk.\u000a\u000aEven for casual lunches, McAfee began regularly coming to town with at least two bodyguards, clad in camouflage and each packing pistols, they said.\u000a\u000a"Generally, you don't need a bodyguard in Belize," said Jorge Alana, a San Pedro Sun reporter who interviewed McAfee several times, noting top elected officials don't have them. "It does call attention when you move with so many guards."\u000a\u000aMcAfee's home is in a stretch of Ambergris where the wealthiest foreigners hole up. Raw lots of land 100 feet by 200 feet (30 meters to 61 meters) can cost up to $500,000 here. Even modest-looking houses reflect multimillion-dollar investments.\u000a\u000aLike McAfee, many of his north shore neighbors tend to favor being left alone, rarely coming to town and loath to mix with tourists.\u000a\u000a"That's why they come to San Pedro," said Daniel Guerrero, the tour guide and real estate broker now serving as the town's mayor. "They like the quietness. They like the isolation."\u000a\u000aBut even fishing, scuba diving and sunset daiquiris can get tiresome. Accustomed to hard work and achievement, newcomers established and kept up the island's charities, locals say. Quite a few foreigners, like McAfee, started local businesses. And some fall out of synch with local culture.\u000a\u000a"It's one thing to vacation here and another thing living here," said Wyoming native Tamara Sniffin, owner and editor of the San Pedro Sun, the local newspaper.\u000a\u000aImmortalized in song by Madonna as La Isla Bonita, Ambergris Caye stretches 27 miles (43 km) along the blue Caribbean below the Mexican border, flanking the world's second-largest barrier reef and some of its finest sport fishing waters.\u000a\u000aThose attributes have attracted well-heeled foreign retirees and celebrities such as actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who owns a small island nearby.\u000a\u000a"Here it's just party, party, work, party," said Iris Mavel, 27, a waitress at a restaurant favored by McAfee. "A lot of couples who come here leave divorced. That's why they call it Temptation Island."\u000a\u000aThe island also has a darker side. Dumped at sea and carried ashore by the tides, bundles of Colombian cocaine flow through the island not far from McAfee's house and on, many say, toward the Mexican border. Cocaine not recovered by the smugglers is collected by islanders, supplying a thriving local drug market that has sparked low-level gang feuds and occasional killings.\u000a\u000aInternational fugitives have taken refuge here. In the summer, a Slovak man accused of murdering a woman, her 10-year-old son and a gangster in his home country was arrested on an international warrant, processed for extradition but then released by a Belizean judge.\u000a\u000aSome townsfolk suspect McAfee is hiding on a yacht off of San Pedro. Others note that Mexico is only an hour away by the sort of fast boat McAfee owns and that passports are never checked for people landing in the oceanfront villages there.\u000a\u000a"I have the feeling that this guy will turn up," Guerrero said. "But he'll turn up with his attorneys. He's a big guy."

VParis:  Scientists in Japan said they have grown human liver tissue from stem cells in a first that holds promise for alleviating the critical shortage of donor organs.\u000aCreating lab-grown tissue to replenish organs damaged by accident or disease is a Holy Grail for the pioneering field of research into the premature cells known as stem cells.\u000aNow Takanori Takebe of the Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine and a team report in the journal Nature that they grew tissue "resembling the (human) adult liver" in a lab mouse.\u000aThey first created induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells which they mixed with other cell types and coaxed into "liver buds"-- the precursor clusters that develop into a liver.\u000aThe buds, each about five millimetres (0.2 inches) big, were then transplanted onto a mouse brain, where they were observed transforming into a "functional human liver" complete with blood vessels, the scientists wrote.\u000a"To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells," said the report.\u000aThe technique has yet to be tested in humans, but serves as an important proof of concept, it added.\u000aStem cells are infant cells that can develop into any part of the body.\u000aUntil a few years ago, when iPS cells were created, the only way to obtain stem cells was to harvest them from human embryos.\u000aThis is controversial because it requires the destruction of the embryo, a process to which religious conservatives and others object.\u000aiPS cells are easily-obtainable mature cells that are "reprogrammed" into a versatile, primitive state from where they can develop into any kind of cell in the body.\u000aTakebe told a press conference ahead of the report's release that the man-made liver was observed through a replacement glass skull that was fitted around the mouse's brain.\u000aThe liver developed blood vessels which fused with those of the animal.\u000aIt also performed certain human-specific liver functions - producing proteins and processing specific drugs.\u000a"We have concluded that this liver is functioning," the scientist said. "We think this is enough for improving the survival after liver failure."\u000aScientists commenting on the research described it as promising.\u000a"This science opens up the distinct possibility of being able to create mini-livers from the skin cells of a patient dying of liver failure," said Malcolm Alison, professor of stem cell biology at the Queen Mary University of London.\u000a"Human mature liver cells transplanted on their own can fail to thrive, but if immature liver cells are first combined with their normally nurturing supportive cells, they can mature in the transplanted host and function efficiently," he said in a statement issued by the Science Media Centre.\u000aDusko Ilic from Kings College London said "the promise of an off-shelf-liver seems much closer than one could hope even a year ago", but the strategy has yet to be proven in humans.\u000a"Whilst the title of the paper is 'functional human liver', these liver buds do not contain the biliary structures (which drain toxins out of the liver) or immune cells that characterise real human liver," added Stuart Forbes, professor of transplantation and regenerative medicine at the University of Edinburgh.\u000aChris Mason of University College London said the buds may be useful for drug testing in the lab, which is currently restricted by the limited availability of liver cells from human cadavers.\u000aTakebe said the method may also work in organs like the pancreas, kidneys or lungs, but it would be another 10 years before trials are done in humans.\u000aOne key requirement would be to shrink the "buds" to a much smaller size so they can be injected into the bloodstream and taken up by the body internally, he said.\u000a

VLeading mobile service providers made it clear on Sunday that mobile phone tariffs are set to increase and freebies and discounts likely to be further brought down.\u000a\u000aThe fresh spectrum purchases at February 2014 auction were being cited as one of the factors for the likely rise in tariffs.\u000a\u000aMarten Pieters, the CEO of the country's second largest service provider Vodafone, said the mobile telecom industry has reached a point where annual tariff increases are needed to sustain itself.\u000a\u000aPieters also said the recent spectrum auction combined with others expected in the next couple of years will worsen the health of the mobile telecom industry at a time when it is yet to recover from the "excesses" of the 2010 auction.\u000a\u000a"We have had declining tariffs for 18 years; this cannot be sustained forever. We believe the point has come where we will have to increase our tariffs every year, depending on cost levels," Pieters, who is Vodafone India Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told PTI.\u000a\u000aBharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular, the three biggest mobile service providers in the country, and Reliance Jio were among eight companies that bid a combined Rs. 61,162 crores for spectrum in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands offered by the government during a 10-day auction that ended on February 13.\u000a\u000a(Also see: Spectrum auction: The complete list of winners)\u000a\u000a"The industry has not yet recovered from the excesses of the 2010 auction and this auction, combined with others expected in the next couple of years, will worsen the industry's health further," Pieters added.\u000a\u000aThe country's mobile subscriber base is currently 88.1 crores, according to Trai.\u000a\u000aThe value of the spectrum at this month's sale was Rs 47,933.40 crores at the reserve price. Companies can pay part of the amount upfront and the rest in instalments.\u000a\u000aPieters said payments for spectrum in the just-concluded auction will be funded by debt and to pay for the loans, either tariffs need to go up or service levels and investments have to be cut back.\u000a\u000a"If you look across the world, spectrum in India is expensive: we pay a lot per megahertz in an auction and then 5 percent of revenue in the form of spectrum usage charges. This will invariably have consequences," Pieters said.\u000a\u000aTelecom operators have been cutting back on freebies and discounted minutes to maintain profitability. Analysts say this trend may continue as they have to pay for the fresh spectrum purchases.\u000a\u000a"We have always maintained over the last few quarters that there is room for reduction of discounted minutes and a gradual movement up of voice realisation," Bharti Airtel (India) Joint Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Gopal Vittal said after the December quarter results.\u000a\u000aHe told investors the difference between headline and realised tariffs was about 30 to 40 percent, providing substantial headroom to cut back on discounted minutes.\u000a\u000aWhile it is too early to comment on tariff hikes, there certainly would be upward pressure on data tariffs and discounted minutes would be reduced, said Rajan S Mathews, Director General of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the GSM industry body.\u000a\u000a"There may also be 1-3 paise hike in voice minutes in over nine months," he added.

VMumbai:\u000aLeading housing finance companies like HDFC and LIC Housing Finance today ruled out immediate reduction in their lending rates citing higher cost of funds.\u000a"It (lending rate cut) is the function of cost of funds. When it comes down, we will pass on the same to customers," HDFC vice-chairman and chief executive Keki Mistry told reporters on the sidelines of an event.\u000aThe chief executive of LIC Housing Finance VK Sharma also expressed similar sentiment, saying "reduction in interest rate will depend on the cost of funds," and pointed out that banks have not reduced their interest rates.\u000aOn the expectation from the monetary policy, Mistry said he was not expecting any rate cut in the policy scheduled to be announced on May 3.\u000aHe also said that despite higher interest rates, the demand for home loans was better last year compared to the previous three-four years.\u000a"Additional tax benefit provided in the Budget will encourage more people to buy property," Mistry added.\u000a The Budget has provided for an additional tax benefit of Rs. 1 lakh in home loan segment over and above the existing tax benefit of Rs. 1.5 lakh, if the value of the property is under Rs. 25 lakh.\u000aMeanwhile, LIC Housing Finance said it was receiving good response for its home loan scheme 'Bhagyalakshmi' targeted at women.\u000a"In the last 2.5 months, we have sanctioned more than Rs. 3,300 crore. Response from young generation ladies has been tremendous," Sharma said.\u000a

VAmitabh Bachchan, in his response to reports on Panama papers, said: Monies that I have remitted overseas have been in compliance with law.\u000aNew Delhi: \u000aHighlights\u000aMegastar Amitabh Bachchan, named in what has been dubbed the Panama Papers - a massive leak of tax documents on offshore companies and accounts of the rich and the powerful - said today that his name may have been "misused".\u000a"I do not know any of the companies referred to by Indian Express - Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd, Lady Shipping Ltd, Treasure Shipping Ltd, and Tramp Shipping Ltd. I have never been a director of any of the above stated companies. It is possible that my name has been misused," Mr Bachchan said in his statement.\u000aThe 73-year-old actor added: "I have paid all my taxes including on monies spent by me overseas. Monies that I have remitted overseas have been in compliance with law... after paying Indian taxes. In any event the news report in Indian Express does not even suggest any illegality on my part."\u000aMr Bachchan's daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai, who was also named, has also rejected the documents.\u000aHer media adviser on Monday called the documents "totally untrue and false".\u000aMs Rai Bachchan was director and shareholder of an offshore company, along with members of her family, before it was thought to have been wound up in 2008, according to the Indian Express.\u000aThe report said 500 Indians are among those holding offshore accounts in the tax haven of Panama.\u000aAs with many of the people named in the documents, there is no evidence offered that the Bollywood A-listers used their companies for improper purposes, and having an offshore entity is not illegal.\u000aThe Express is among more than 100 media groups which have investigated the 11.5 million documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm with offices in 35 countries.\u000a

VNew York:\u000aThe yen rallied on Tuesday, snapping a three-day decline against the dollar and euro as it neared 100 to the dollar, while a fall in Chinese inflation and expectations for modest growth in US corporate earnings helped stocks.\u000aThe Japanese currency weakened to reach 99.66 to the dollar using Reuters data, the greenback's strongest level against it since May 2009, before the sell-off in the yen stalled. The euro peaked at 129.93 yen, its highest since January 2010.\u000aAnalysts believe it is only a matter of time before the dollar sails past the 100 yen mark.\u000a"Given the breadth of yen bearishness, any reprieve would likely encourage investors to reestablish short yen positions at more favorable exchange rates," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, DC.\u000aThe dollar selling on Tuesday left the greenback down 0.5 per cent at 98.86 yen, while the euro was off 0.1 per cent on the day at 129.13 yen.\u000aEquity markets were up as investors hoped for more accommodative monetary policy from China following benign inflation data, and after US resources giant Alcoa posted earnings.\u000aThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 24.78 points, or 0.17 per cent, at 14,638.26.\u000aThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 2.51 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 1,565.58.\u000aThe Nasdaq Composite Index was up 6.93 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 3,229.19.\u000aA significant driver of the rally has been the extraordinary stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve, and with the start of corporate earnings season for the first quarter, investors will be looking at company forecasts to gauge whether the fundamentals are strong enough to keep stocks climbing higher, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.\u000a"The rally will be confirmed if earnings can stay strong and if companies can continue to thrive even as government spending is reduced, and I think it will falter if it proves (companies) are unable to do so," said Mr Meckler.\u000aAlcoa Inc, the first Dow component to release results, reported a higher quarterly profit but lower-than-expected revenue after the bell on Monday. Shares of the largest US aluminum producer were up 0.3 per cent at $8.43.\u000aCopyright @ Thomson Reuters 2013\u000a
