S' BEIJING: Chinese foreign ministry has blamed India for the stone pelting near the Pongong Lake in the Ladakh sector of the border on August 15, and said Indian troops started throwing stones at Chinese military personnel who were conducting routing patrolling activity. The incident raised the temper on the India-China border which has seen troops from both sides restricting themselves to wresting and some amount of shoving and pushing over past two months. \n "According to our information, on August 15, the Chinese border troops conducted normal patrol on the Chinese side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) around Pangong area," ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said. "During this process, the Indian side took some violent actions and injured the Chinese border personnel. This has violated the consensus between the Indian and Chinese side in relation to the border issues." she said. \n  Indian officials had earlier said that Chinese troops had entered the Indian border and pelted stones at Indian soldiers. \n Hua said that, "China has expressed grave dissatisfaction and we have lodged serious concerns to the Indian side". Beijing also told India "to strictly discipline the conduct of the Indian border troops to earnestly uphold the peace and tranquility of the boundary area of the two sides." \n "The Indian side has violated the consensus on the stability of border areas and threatened that situation of the west section of the China-India border," Hua said. \n Meanwhile, sections of the Chinese media including the ultra nationalist Global Times and Lianhe Zaobao newspaper quoted experts saying that China\'s People\'s Liberation Army were conducting live fire drills in the western sector close to the Indian border to "strike awe in India" which has been involved along with China in a military standoff at Doklam for over two months. Chinese television also showed a 5-minute long video of a military drill involving 10 PLA\'s units that including its aviation and armoured troops. \n There was no official confirmation about the drill. A similar claim by the Chinese media was rejected by Indian officials recently. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S'Acid reflux can get worse with the intake of certain foods. While certain foods like caffeine, fried and spicy foods are a complete no-no when you have bouts of acid reflux, some foods are better tolerated than others. If you do not know what to eat when suffering from acid reflux, we got you the list from nutritionist Urvashi Sawhney.\nLess acidic fruits: Fruits like banana and pears other non-acidic fruits are good to beat acidity. Not only do these fruits contain vitamins and minerals that help build the damaged stomach wall portions but also protect your stomach lining from acid attacks.\nBoiled vegetables: Boiled vegetables are easy to digest. Not only do boiled veggies require less stomach acid to be absorbed, but they are also quickly cleared from the stomach and sent to the rest of the intestine.\nMilk: Milk is perfect for soothing an irritated stomach lining and oesophagus. When consumed cold, milk soothes a burning throat, and its basic nature neutralises excessive acids in the stomach.\nLean meats: Low in fat and high in protein lean meats such as chicken and fish can help reduce acid reflux. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t fry them, eat them grilled, poached, and baked.\nHealthy fats: When you experience acid reflux, you need to reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats and replace them with healthier unsaturated fats like avocados, flaxseeds, walnuts, olive oil and sesame oil.\nOatmeal: Whole grains like oatmeal is an excellent source of fibre that can absorb acid and reduce the symptoms of reflux in the stomach.\n'

S"You've just taken a new brief from a new client and now you're sitting at your desk waiting for inspiration to strike. Do you really expect the perfect logo design to pop up, fully formed, in your mind? If you do, you could be in for a long wait.\nInstead, it's up to you to seek out logo design inspiration. If you let a wide variety of ideas collide inside your brain, gradually they should coalesce into the logo you're looking for. The trick is knowing where to look for inspiration in the first place.\nBelow are some suggestions of places you could start \xe2\x80\x93 but remember this can never be an exhaustive list because inspiration can come from anything, anywhere...\n01. Look beyond the obvious\nClassic logos are a good place to start... but make sure you don't stop there\nCast your net far and wide. Don't just look at the top 10 best logos ever (although that's not a bad place to start). You need to also look beyond that, at design in general and at the wider world. \nWhenever you see something that stands out or appeals to you, for whatever reason, file that thought. Let it inform your design process and contribute as your new logo starts to evolve.\n02. Just doodle\nDon't overthink things \xe2\x80\x93 start with some free doodles (photo by Sticker Mule on Unsplash)\nSometimes you can overthink these things and end up getting nowhere, so why not cut your conscious mind out of the loop and instead let the creativity flow, unguided, with a bit of random doodling? \nYou may well end up with a page of pointless scribbles, but somewhere in the disjointed mess of lines you might spot something that fires up that essential spark of inspiration.\n03. Explore design websites\nOn sites like Behance you can filter search results to logo designs\nThere are a number of dedicated logo design sites, including Logo Gala and Logo Moose, as well as Creative Bloq's dedicated logo news channel. But you should also widen your research to include other graphic design sites, and art and design sites in general, like Dribbble, Behance or DeviantArt.\nExplore further down the results pages to visit sites you haven't seen before and also narrow your search to put the spotlight on logos in the same industry or belonging to companies of similar size, aspirations and values.\n04. Plunder your client's history\nTake a dive back into your client's logo design history\nCheck out all the various logos your client has employed since the company was founded. This can be particularly interesting if they go back for many decades. \nYou may be able to hark back to the past, if the client would like to position itself as a heritage brand, or you might be able to radically overhaul tits original logo into something fresh and modern. This has the advantage of built-in continuity even as you present a new image.\n05. Explore your client's future\nDiscuss with your client its plans for the future \xe2\x80\x93 what does it envisage for the next 12 months or the next five years? Are there changes of direction imminent or new products coming on stream that could have some bearing on the logo you design? You need to future-proof the logo because businesses do change over time.\nTake, for example, Carphone Warehouse: no-one buys carphones any more \xe2\x80\x93 so should it lose a highly successful brand that has taken years to build by changing its name to something more appropriate?\n06. Phone a friend\nA fresh eye can provide you with valuable insights (photo by William Iven on Unsplash)\nWhile it makes perfect sense to get as much information as you can from the client, sometimes there's nothing quite so helpful as a fresh pair of eyes. \nIf you have some ideas worked up, take them to a friend who has absolutely no connection to the project, and see what they think. Often someone's untainted opinion can be just what you need to fire the imagination.\n07. Build some mood boards\nThe Matboard is a great mood board tool\nMood boards and brainstorms can help you to straighten out your thoughts and mix up different images and ideas of all shapes, sizes and themes. \nPlay with keywords and synonyms and gather a multitude of inspirations from different sources onto a single mood board to see how they combine.\n08. Trawl through your own design archives\nIt's probably a fair guess that for every logo you design you probably come up with a couple of dozen sketches before you decide which one to develop further. Never throw away these early ideas, as they form a valuable resource. Just because one of your early sketches didn't work for a previous client, it doesn't mean it won't work at all. \nGo back through previous work that you've done but not used and you may find the seed that, with a bit of nurturing, could grow to become the logo you're looking for.\n09. Blast your brain with random images\nCheck out the Creative Bloq Pinterest boards for a blast of inspiration\nScroll through Google Images and Pinterest on both related and unrelated subjects to your client's logo needs. Then add the results to your mood board. \nPick a colour here, a shape there, a word, a typeface... then see how these different ideas could work together.\n10. Stay receptive\nAt the end of the day, inspiration can strike anywhere, at any time. Be receptive to the ideas that flow through your mind. Sketch something as it comes to you and then revisit it later to see how it might work within the parameters of your brief. \nAt these early stages of the design process you need to allow your creativity full rein. Give yourself plenty of ideas to work with and then take the best elements from each and discard the rest.\n11. Do something else\nGive your mind a break from the task at hand (photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters on Unsplash)\nIf you've tried everything and nothing's coming up, don't try to force it. Take a break and let your brain get on with other things. Go to see a film, play some video games, cook a nice meal or just have a lovely nap. It's amazing how just getting away from the problem at hand and thinking about something else can result in a sudden flash of exactly the right kind of inspiration.\nThere's no point just waiting for inspiration to hit. The more you search it out, the easier you'll find it. You'll develop an eye for what works and what doesn't, and how you can apply this to your own nascent designs.\n"

S'Miley Cyrus unleashed a bundle of joy this week in the form of her new video for \xe2\x80\x9cYounger Now\xe2\x80\x9d and we\xe2\x80\x99re still processing the epic-ness of it all (Child mimes! Studded jumpsuits! Poodle skirts!). In the clearest sign yet that her twerking / \xe2\x80\x98Bangerz\xe2\x80\x99 days are over, Miley is going back to her country roots with an epic ode to Elvis (her-self-professed hero) and 1950s rockabilly style. From pompadours to poodle skirts, we break down our favourite looks from the video.\nAt the start of the video, we see Miley in \xe2\x80\x9cSleeping Beauty\xe2\x80\x9d repose, lying in bed in a white nightgown and minimal makeup, as though \xe2\x80\x9call this time she\xe2\x80\x99s been asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s Miley at her most honest and vulnerable.\nNext, we see Miley transformed into a rockabilly crooner, decked out in a Western-style red satin blouse and shorts, with her hair done up in a loose pompadour with strands falling loose. She\xe2\x80\x99s getting closer to personifying her idol, the King of Rock n\xe2\x80\x99 Roll here, and goddamn, she looks FIERCE. We also see her hanging in a puppet show with a mini-me puppet representing little girl Miley of days gone by. It\xe2\x80\x99s is the cutest thing to see because she hugs and smiles at the puppet and is totally loving herself \xe2\x80\x94 past, present and everything. (And silly as it may seem, we should *all* do this, at least in theory).\nThen, along comes the \xe2\x80\x9cYounger Now\xe2\x80\x9d parade float, complete with little dudes in pastel blue Western jumpsuits and Miley donning an off-the-shoulder red ruffled dress while strumming the guitar. The dress looks like something Miley\xe2\x80\x99s godmother and country singer Dolly Parton (who Miley duets with on her soon-to-be-released new album) would have worn in the 1960s.\nThen, it\xe2\x80\x99s Miley as full-on rebel as she\xe2\x80\x99s clad in a black-studded leather jumpsuit (designed by bestie and Moschino designer Jeremy Scott), and hanging out with a ragtag posse of older drag queens, carnies and gang members that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess with late at night in a dark alley.\nNest, Miley full-on channels Elvis in a powder-blue rhinestone-studded jumpsuit and perfected pompadour. She\xe2\x80\x99s surrounded by children dressed as mimes that scurry around her (a metaphor for what she used to be?). With this look, her transformation is almost complete.\nNext, there\xe2\x80\x99s a brief intermission, as we see Miley seemingly trapped in some sort of carnival ride / dungeon situation while dressed like a rainbow harlequin in a red ruffled skirt and pink platforms. Could this be a nod to the industrial vibe of the \xe2\x80\x9cWrecking Ball\xe2\x80\x9d video? We\xe2\x80\x99re not entirely sure\xe2\x80\xa6\nThen, Miley freefalls through the sky, dressed like a renegade member of the Blue Man Group, in what seems to be a dream sequence that she alluded to in the song\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics and more specifically, the line \xe2\x80\x9cWhat goes up, must come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFinally, the last (and best) sequence of \xe2\x80\x9cYounger Now\xe2\x80\x9d shows Miley united with her ragtag team of queens dressed in full sock-hop regalia: swingy poodle skirts, neck ties and bobby socks all in ice cream hues. It\xe2\x80\x99s a moment of joyful celebration as Miley gleefully kicks up her heels and parades across the floor in what looks to be a \xe2\x80\x9950s-style pastel dream malt shop. She and her crew dance with abandon until they all come tumbling down to the floor. And\xe2\x80\xa6 scene.\nAside from all the fashion, what we love most about \xe2\x80\x9cYounger Now\xe2\x80\x9d is that Cyrus is clearly the happiest she\xe2\x80\x99s ever been, which radiates throughout the video. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of authentic freedom and self-acceptance that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there during her \xe2\x80\x9cWrecking Ball\xe2\x80\x9d days. Just witness the lyrics: \xe2\x80\x9cEven though it\xe2\x80\x99s not who I am / I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of who I used to be\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cChange is a thing you can count on / I feel so much younger now\xe2\x80\x9d. A simple message, but a very cool one nonetheless. \n'

S'Sunday night\'s Game of Thrones episode was thrilling, to say the very least. Fans saw Jon make good on his crazy plan to breach the wall and abduct a wight. What followed was a brutal battle between Jon\'s squad and the immensely massive army of the undead. Sadly, in the midst of the chaos, one of Dany\'s dragons was taken down by the Night King and Jon Snow almost died as well. He ended up making it out alive and when he woke up, a grieving Mother of Dragons was by his side. Dany and Jon shared a touching moment on Game of Thrones and added fuel to their flirtation in the process. Oh, and Jon recognized Daenerys as "my queen," which really set Twitter off.\nThe moment began with Jon\'s blurry vision bringing Dany into focus, which was super suggestive of their connection if you ask me. I don\'t know, but cinematography aside, Dany immediately told Jon that she would fight against the Night King\'s army alongside him and he responded with, "Thank you, Dany." She was clearly all sweetly flustered by his use of her nickname, but things got really serious when he followed up by referring to her as "my queen." He even told her that he would "bend the knee" if he wasn\'t laying in bed with wounds all over him. When she questioned about his followers up in the North, he told her that they would see how amazing she was and follow her as well. Then, they held hands and every fan on the planet exploded into swoons. One thing is for sure, Dany and Jon \'shippers on Twitter were absolutely all about the moment... while others felt slightly icky about it. \nMost Fans Really Want To Forget They Are Related\n*Repeats to myself* "Jon and Dany don\'t know they\'re related so it\'s okay to root for them" #GameofThrones #ThronesYall pic.twitter.com/xTAwz2rDyA\n\xe2\x80\x94 Mica (@MicasHoneymoon) August 21, 2017 \n*Watching Season One of #GameOfThrones* : Gross incest make it stop\n*Watching Season Seven* : Whatever Dany and Jon should hook up\n\xe2\x80\x94 Jamie Bernam (@JamieBernam) August 14, 2017 \nAs long as Dany and Jon don\'t know that they\'re related, I\'m perfectly fine with them being together. #GameOfThrones #ThronesYall pic.twitter.com/20Vs5bGF0z\n\xe2\x80\x94 Kosar (@615Kosar) August 21, 2017 \nWhen I ship Jon & Dany, and some fool reminds me of incest. #DemThrones #ThronesYall pic.twitter.com/kFBn346igh\n\xe2\x80\x94 Cynthia Dewi Oka (@freedewi) August 21, 2017 \nOOOOH JON AND DANY\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f MY QUEEN!!!

S' Shimla: For the implementation of a UN environment project to conserve biodiversity, Himachal Pradesh has taken a lead in formulating the biodiversity management committees in various gram panchayats. As many as 366 management committees have been constituted in biodiversity-rich districts like Chamba, Kullu, Shimla, Sirmour, Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti in the first phase. \n The objective of this project is to increase the institutional, individual and systemic capacities of stakeholders on access and benefit-sharing basis. This project is being implemented in 10 states across India, including Himachal Pradesh. \n A government spokesperson said in a statement that the state government has already set up a state biodiversity board under the chairmanship of additional chief secretary (environment) to effectively implement the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act-2002. \n He said that act provides solutions towards conservation of diversity, sustainable use of its components and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources. \n He said that biodiversity management committees have taken an initiative to document the biological diversity available in the respective areas, including the traditional knowledge by way of preparing people\'s biodiversity registers. Leading research universities of the state have also associated in this documentation exercise, the spokesperson added. \n Official said that emphasis has also been given on building capacity of stakeholders by organising training and awareness workshops on the grass-roots level. So far, around 150 awareness and training programmes have been organised to empower the stakeholders. \n About Rs 2.32 crore has been received for such activities under the project. \n He further observed that awareness campaign and concerted efforts of the state biodiversity board launched to conserve the rich biodiversity with the active participation of the stakeholders will go a long way in creating a mass movement in saving the rare plants and species. "As many as 60 medicinal plant species in the state are facing a threat of extinction," he said. \n Himachal Pradesh has a rich biodiversity and at present the flora of the state consists of around 180 families comprising 1,038 genera and 3,400 species. Many plant species found in the state are rare in nature, which makes this floristic richness even crucial. There are many rare plants particularly in the upper region of Himalayas, which have immense potential for use in the pharmaceutical industry. \n'

S'By Ruma Paul and Zarir Husain\nDHAKA/GUWAHATI, India, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Widespread floods have killed more than 800 people and displaced over a million in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, with aid workers warning of severe food shortages and water-borne diseases as rains continue to lash the affected areas.\nSeasonal monsoon rains, a lifeline for farmers across South Asia, typically cause loss of life and property every year between July and September, but officials say this year\'s flooding is the worst in several years.\nAt least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected in Bangladesh as floods submerged more than a third of the low-lying and densely populated country.\n"The water level has gradually dropped. The flood situation will improve if it does not rain upstream any further," Sazzad Hossain, executive engineer of Bangladesh\'s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, told Reuters.\nReaz Ahmed, the director general of Bangladesh\'s Disaster Management Department, said there are rising concerns about food shortages and the spread of disease.\n"With the flood waters receding, there is a possibility of an epidemic. We fear the outbreak of water-borne diseases if clean water is not ensured soon," Ahmed told Reuters.\nWith some rivers running above danger levels, 225 bridges have been damaged in Bangladesh, disrupting food and medicine supplies to people displaced from their homes, said aid workers.\nIn the Indian state of Assam bordering Bangladesh, at least 180 people have been killed in the past few weeks.\n"With the floods washing away everything... there is not even a trace of our small thatched hut," said Lakshmi Das, a mother of three, living in Kaliabor, Assam.\n"We do not even have a second pair of clothes to wear. The government is not providing any aid."\nTorrential rains have also hit the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur, killing at least 30 people.\nFlood waters of the Brahmaputra river had earlier in July submerged the Kaziranga wildlife sanctuary in Assam. The floods have since killed more than 350 animals, including 24 endangered one-horned rhinoceros, five elephants and a tiger.\n"We are facing a wildlife disaster," Assam Forest Minister Pramila Rani Brahma told Reuters.\nMeanwhile, in the eastern state of Bihar, at least 253 people lost their lives where incessant rains washed away crops, destroyed roads and disrupted power supplies.\nA senior official in Bihar\'s disaster management department, Anirudh Kumar, said nearly half a million people have been provided with shelter.\nIn Nepal, 141 people were confirmed dead, while thousands of survivors returned to their semi-destroyed homes.\n"Their homes are in a state of total destruction," said Francis Markus from International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n'

S' An artiste should be willing to embrace other art forms, says TMK \nReaching out: Vocalist T.M. Krishna during an interaction with The Hindu in Visakhapatnam. | Photo Credit: C.V.Subrahmanyam\nBe it the counter-cultural arts movement \xe2\x80\x98Urur Olcott Kuppam Vizha\xe2\x80\x99 or the collaborative concert with Jogappas, a transgender community in parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, or his recent popular track \xe2\x80\x98Poromboke paadal\xe2\x80\x99, Carnatic singer T.M. Krishna believes that an artiste should explore the untouched space of music and strive to make music accessible to all sections of society. \nIn an interview with The Hindu, TMK does not mince words while expressing his views on the need to bring marginalised art forms to the limelight, breaking free from the age-old caste shackles.\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt is a channel through which we connect with communities. Take for instance, the outreach initiative Urur Olcott Kuppam Vizha where art is presented in public places. We [a group of artistes] took part in performing art relay by boarding the public transport system. Later, a group of dancers performed Bharatanatyam at Chennai Central Railway Station on Independence Day. The idea is to bring communities together,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Ramon Magsaysay Award winner who came to the city to present a Carnatic concert at the recently-held annual music, dance and drama festival hosted by the Visakha Music and Dance Academy. \nBesides a number of artistes present in Visakhapatnam, TMK observes that the city comprises several music teachers who could come up with their own creative ideas to support marginalised art forms. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil we presented a concert with Jogappas, not many knew about their devotional music. An artiste should be willing to embrace other art forms so that communities performing the art not only takes the centre stage but will also be respected,\xe2\x80\x9d the singer opines. \nTerming caste as the biggest hurdle in the endeavour to transform society, TMK says music should break free of such shackles. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery art has its own beauty. Initially, when I was performing a concert with Jogappas, I was confined to my own ideas about the community. However, when we started singing, we enjoyed learning from each other. They were gracious enough to share the stage and their immense musical knowledge with me,\xe2\x80\x9d says the renowned musician, who says he is looking forward to present concerts with Jogappas at their home ground. \nAbout the next generation, TMK says the youngsters are far more open-minded towards bringing social change as they carry less baggage.\n'

S' NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has extended the date of the second phase of counselling for MBBS admissions to private medical colleges to August 31, from the earlier date of August 19. The SC\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is on the request submitted by the state government to extend the date.\n Meanwhile the re-examination petition filed by the state government against the SC\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that gave permission for the Kozhikode KMCT and Ernakulam Sree Narayana colleges to levy up to Rs. 11 lakhs as fees would be considered later.\n There is also another petition submitted by the state government seeking for a third phase of allotment to medical and dental courses that is pending with the SC.\n Earlier the HC had approved the Rs. 5 lakh fees fixed by the Justice Rajendra Babu Commission. Kozhikode KMCT and Ernakulam Sree Narayana colleges had approached the SC against this.\n Perinthalmanna MES, and Karakkonam CSI medical colleges have also approached the SC against the HC cancelling some of the conditions mentioned in the contract that allowed allotment under four levels of fees structure. The SC will consider this case also on a later date.\n These two colleges have signed the contract with the government following the same fees structure as the previous year, and with the HC\xe2\x80\x99s cancellation of some of the conditions in the contract, these colleges submitted a letter with the government saying that they are backing off from the contract.\n'

S" A dermatologist approved guide to your best beauty sleep ever. \nIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t wash my face tonight, it won\xe2\x80\x99t kill me is something every woman has thought as she collapses into bed after a particularly long, taxing day. While it definitely won\xe2\x80\x99t kill you, regularly neglecting a proper nighttime ritual will eventually catch up to you. The sooner you develop a steadfast routine, the better your skin will look and feel. Not only will it keep your complexion youthful, but it will also become a way to help you relax and unwind before slipping between the sheets. We talked with dermatologist, Dr. Allison Arthur, about the proper skincare steps you should take before hitting the hay.\nStep One: Remove Makeup\nSince you were old enough to wear makeup, your mama has always told you to never go to bed with a full face on. She\xe2\x80\x99s right: It\xe2\x80\x99s key to preventing eye irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you consistently go to sleep without washing your face, you're letting the makeup, sweat, excess oil, and environmental pollutants that have accumulated throughout the day sit on your skin for many hours. This can lead to irritation and clogging of the pores, which can cause acne,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Dr. Arthur. Keep a pack of makeup removing wipes like Simple\xe2\x80\x99s Micellar Makeup Remover Wipes on your end table for those nights you accidentally doze off before taking off your mascara.\nStep Two: Cleanse\nWashing your face is crucial to removing the grime that\xe2\x80\x99s built up on your face over the day. Simply choose a cleanser based on your skin\xe2\x80\x99s needs, massage it in with lukewarm water and rinse. Also don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to exfoliate twice a week: It\xe2\x80\x99s important because it removes dead skin cells, keeping skin smooth. You can do this by applying your favorite face wash to a cleansing brush, like a Clarisonic, or by washing with a gentle scrub. Make a point to avoid any formulas with walnut particles or microbeads since they can damage the skin\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nStep Three: Treat\nAfter cleansing, apply a collagen-boosting treatment like SkinMedica\xe2\x80\x99s TNS Recovery Complex that helps improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone and texture. \xe2\x80\x9cOur skin naturally has growth factors (proteins that help with collagen production), but these levels decline with time,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Dr. Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why I like to apply a topical treatment with topical growth factors that trick my skin into thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s still twenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d Another way to protect against aging is by applying a pea-sized amount of retinol all over skin two to three times a week. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a vitamin-A derived product that effects cell turnover, helps prevent pores from clogging, and stimulates collagen,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Arthur. For first time retinol users, Dr. Arthur suggests easing it into your routine since it can make skin dry, flaky and pink. With time your skin gets used to it and these side effects diminish, leaving behind a smooth, glowing complexion.\nStep Four: Moisturize\nLock everything in place with hydrating moisturizer. A formula with hyaluronic acid is always a great bet since it draws water into the skin, keeping it plump and nourished.\nWATCH: Secrets of Flawless Skin\nStep Five: Remember Your Eyes\nThe eyes are more sensitive than the rest of the skin on your face, so it\xe2\x80\x99s important to apply a cream specially targeting this area. \xe2\x80\x9cI like using an eye cream that has hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin (and make fine lines less noticeable), and caffeine to help alleviate puffiness,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Arthur. Use your ring finger to gently apply it underneath your eyes. This is also the time to apply an eyelash serum. As you age, your lashes tend to decline in thickness and length, so Dr. Arthur suggests talking to your dermatologist about Latisse to fill out your fringe.\nStep Six: Apply The Finishing Touches\nOnce your face is ready to hit the pillow, use a bit of Vaseline and Aquaphor on lips and cuticles for added nourishment. Then after setting your alarm and turning off the lights, apply a hand cream as the final step of your overnight glam routine (this prevents you from getting sticky fingerprints everywhere) and get ready to channel your inner Sleeping Beauty.\nYou May Like\n"

S'The face is the primary aesthetic part of our frame. When engaged in conversation or day to day interactions, we always take a look at the opposite people face. It is the only function of our frame, which distinguishes us from each other. A youthful face represents a younger person.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9clayer approach\xe2\x80\x9d to the face is the maximum comprehensive. The maximum superficial layer of your face is your pores and skin. To correct the consequences of sun harm, a few plastic surgeons first recommend first-rate skin care consisting of suitable pores and skin care products, IPL Photo facials, or chemical peels.\nThe next layers of your face are addressed by using facelift affordable surgeries. The facelift fines the loose pores and skin to your face and neck, tightens the underlying tissues, and removes extra fat. Plastic surgeons carry out maximum of their facelifts with the usage of new endoscopic techniques. With these strategies, a small endoscope is inserted via a small incision in the scalp. The complete surgical treatment is accomplished underneath the facial pores and skin resulting in no seen scars on the face. There is a faster healing with minimal bruising and swelling.\nThe deep gentle tissues of your face account on your cheeks and dark depressions under the eyes.

While the cheek augmentation makes the cheek bones themselves wider or greater ahead appearing, the buccal fats excision removes fats from overweight cheeks below the bones. Fatty tissue removed from the face or other components of the body can be liquefied, used to fill out thinning lips or reduce facial depressions\nThe rhytidectomy can be accomplished alone, in conjunction with a neck re-contouring method (cervicoplasty), brows elevate, or with different procedures, you might desire. At your consultation, the health practitioner will assist you decide which alternative is first-class for you.\nThe surgical operations in Hospitals in Baja California are accomplished with advanced anesthesia, with quality local anesthetics introduced to decrease postoperative ache.

S' (CNN)Despite a 23-year campaign urging that babies be put to bed on their backs, only 43.7% of US mothers report that they both intend to use this method and actually do so all the time, according to a new study. \nThe Safe to Sleep campaign has been telling both caregivers and parents to use this position since 1994. Placing babies on their backs before they go to sleep reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, an unexplained fatal condition also known as SIDS, as well as other sleep-related infant deaths like suffocation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe study, published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics, surveyed 3,297 mothers, of whom 77.3% reported that they usually -- but not always -- put their babies to sleep on their backs.\n"What was new and hadn\'t been explored before was this idea of what people intended to do versus what they actually do," said Dr. Eve Colson, professor of pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the study. "What we found was that people intended to put their baby on their back but didn\'t always do that."\nAnother finding was that those who felt the baby\'s sleeping position was not up to them, but rather the baby or another family member, were more than three times as likely to place the baby on its stomach.\nThe two main critiques of back sleep were the fear that the baby might choke and that it\'s less comfortable than having them sleep on their stomachs, Colson said. \nThese beliefs could be from lack of education, as well as cultural and familial influences, said Dr. Robin Jacobson, a pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children\'s Hospital at NYU Langone Health, who was not involved in the study. Many prior generations had their babies sleep on their stomachs, she said.\n"Grandmothers and aunts and everybody have told (mothers), if they have babies sleep on their bellies, they\'re more comfortable; they\'re not going to choke," she said. "And because of that, a new mom who doesn\'t really have a lot of information is using information from everybody else in their life."\nA racial disparity\nThe new research oversampled Hispanic and African-American women in order to make adequate comparisons across racial groups, the authors said. African-American mothers were reported to be the least likely to put their babies on their backs, compared with other demographics.\nThere were about 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths in the US in 2015, according to the CDC. SIDS account for 1,600 of those while 1,200 are due to unknown causes and 900 were due to accidental suffocation and strangulation while in bed. The sudden unexpected infant death rate of non-Hispanic black infants was 170.2 per 100,000 live births between 2011 and 2014, more than twice that of non-Hispanic white infants (83.8 per 100,000).\nThe elevated rate has a lot to do with societal norms, said Dr. Rachel Moon, a pediatrician who has studied SIDS in African-American communities.\n"There\'s very much a culture of putting babies on their stomach in an African-American community," said Moon, who was not involved in the new study. "There\'s a lot more dependence on grandmothers and other senior family members as trusted sources, and lots of times, the information that you get from your family members is more persuasive than what you get from physicians and other sources."\nMoon also said that parents perceive babies to be uncomfortable if they are frequently waking or crying while on their backs, so they let the child determine the sleeping position.\n"I think the fact that parents don\'t feel like they have control is something we can talk about," she said. "It\'s often the child that\'s the queen or the king of the household. And I think parents often forget that they\'re the adults of the household, and they can actually make decisions if they think they\'re right for their children."\nPreventing SIDS\nThe latest guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics advise that parents sleep in the same room -- but not the same bed -- as infants until the child is at least 6 months old.\nBabies should be placed on their backs on a firm sleeping surface with a tight-fitted sheet and no pillows or blankets, to prevent suffocation and overheating. They should never be put on couches, sofas or cushioned chairs to sleep. \nBut what\'s the best way to ensure that everyone obtains access to this information?\nThe key is educating parents\' friends and families, facilitating open conversations about infant sleep and encouraging the media and advertisers to display images of safe sleep practices, according to an editorial accompanying the new study.\nIt also noted that health care providers should be consistently communicating clear messages about safe sleep guidelines.\n"Every single health care provider needs to be saying the same thing," Moon said. \nJoin the conversation\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe study found that those who received advice from their doctor consistent with the guidelines were less likely to place a baby on its side or stomach to sleep.\n"You don\'t really realize when you\'re doing this day in and day out that moms really respect you and really listen to what you\'re saying and even would agree with you over their own mother or somebody else in their life," Jacobson said of doctors. "So I definitely think this needs to be publicized again in the American Academy of Pediatrics and with pediatricians to really push the Safe to Sleep program." \n'

S'Srinagar: The J&K High Court on Monday directed the state government to investigate allegations made by CBI that its computers were stolen by the state police last year.\n A division bench headed by Chief Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice MK Hanjura directed Additional Advocate General BA Dar to investigate allegations made by the CBI today in court.\n Though the alleged theft took place last year, it was only today that it was brought to the notice of the court. According to the CBI\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, the theft had hampered the investigation process into an alleged scam of funds in the Jammu Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA).\n \xe2\x80\x9cSince the last one year we have not been able to investigate the matter as computers with data were stolen from office chambers of CBI,\xe2\x80\x9d Advocate Tahir Shamsi told the court.\n CBI officer Balbir Singh told the court that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s computers had been stolen by \xe2\x80\x9cstate police led by SP headquarters\xe2\x80\x9d and said that \xe2\x80\x9cour rooms were locked after we came here in Kashmir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n During a previous hearing, the CBI in its application had said that prolonged curfew in Kashmir had made the investigation into the alleged JKCA scam impossible. \xe2\x80\x9cNo investigation could be carried out in the state due to imposition of continuous curfew,\xe2\x80\x9d the CBI had said in its application. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever progress was possible, it was done by carrying out the investigation in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n The CBI had also stated that the bank accounts that were \xe2\x80\x9cclandestinely opened and operated for siphoning of funds of JKCA\xe2\x80\x9d had been traced. It said that a chart of the money flow had been prepared and the persons involved were being examined.\n \xe2\x80\x9cMultiple bank accounts of different individuals in which funds of JKCA have been transferred during the relevant period have been spotted and documents collected. Reason for transfer of funds needs to be further investigated,\xe2\x80\x9d the CBI had told the court.\n On Monday the court directed the state government that sports activities should not be stopped and the Sher-i-Kashmir international stadium should be upgraded and sports activities be resumed there.\n \xe2\x80\x9cNot a single activity is done there. Why is a sport suffering? Long ago a couple of international matches were played, but nothing after that. Let the investigations run parallel to sports, not without them,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chief Justice remarked.\n'

S'Malda: About 152 people have died while over 1.5 crore people have been affected across 11 districts and around Rs 14,000 crore worth properties were damaged due to floods in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday. The Chief Minister also said that the Centre must treat all flood-affected states equally and provide flood-related funds to each one of them. "We have heard that Centre has released Rs 2000 crore funds for Assam and also released funds for Gujarat. I have no objection to that as I want every flood-affected state should get such packages. Bengal has been equally affected by floods just like Gujarat, Assam and Bihar. We also need such packages and we will send a full report on Bengal floods to the Centre. It is a legitimate demand and we believe that we will get it," Banerjee said after holding a meeting with state and district officials in Malda district.\nThe CM held a monitoring meeting in which state Chief Secretary Malay De, Home Secretary Atri Bhattacharya, DGP Surajit Purkayastha, disaster management secretary and DMs of the six affected districts were present.\nBanerjee, who visited the three flood-hit districts of Malda, Uttar Dinajpur and Dakshin Dinajpur to take stock of the situation there, said that around 45,000 people have been affected in the three districts.\nThe chief minister said the state government\'s primary task was to help those affected by the floods.\n"Our primary objective is to rescue and provide relief and then start the restoration of the damaged houses. We have to disinfect the tubewells, schools, health centres, hospitals," she said.\nThe administration has been instructed to take proper precautionary measures and supply medicines keeping in mind the possibility of the outbreak of several waterborne diseases in the aftermath of floods, Banerjee said.\n"There has been massive rainfall in this season but the flood was caused mainly because of overflowing river water.\nThis is a natural phenomenon, but I think the Centre must look into this," she said.\nThe Centre must conduct dredging. Dredging was not done in the Farakka barrage), barrages in Durgapur and the DVC. Water from the Sankosh river inundated West Bengal, she said.\n"During summer, we face water scarcity because river water is stopped at different dams and during monsoon the dams release water which inundates areas in West Bengal," the CM said.\n"We must keep in mind that states have their boundaries and we must maintain good relations with each other", she said.\n'

S'Ahmedabad: The Gujarat High Court today issued notices to the Election Commission and Congress leader Ahmed Patel on a petition filed by BJP candidate Balwantsinh Rajput challenging the EC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to invalidate the votes of two rebel Congress MLAs in Rajya Sabha polls.\nJustice Bela Trivedi issued notices to the EC, Patel and also the two other candidates \xe2\x80\x93 BJP president Amit Shah and Union minister Smriti Irani.\nThe notices are returnable on September 21. Rajput, the BJP candidate who lost the Rajya Sabha poll from Gujarat, had moved the court against the EC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to invalidate the votes of two rebel Congress MLAs. He had quit the Congress ahead of the August 8 polls.\nRajput contended that the votes of two other Congress MLAs should also be discounted as they too had shown their ballot papers to unauthorised persons, and he be declared the winner.\nThe EC\xe2\x80\x99s decision paved the way for the victory of Congress candidate Patel \xe2\x80\x94 who got 44 votes, the minimum he needed to win \xe2\x80\x94 in the high-stakes electoral battle. Rajput polled 38 votes.\nRajput\xe2\x80\x99s petition said that once the returning officer had used his discretion to accept the two votes as valid, the EC had \xe2\x80\x9cno power to issue any direction to the returning officer for accepting or rejecting any vote\xe2\x80\x9d. The EC had invalidated the votes of former Congress MLAs Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohel.\nCongress\xe2\x80\x99 polling agent Shaktisinh Gohil had lodged a complaint before the counting began, saying the two MLAs showed their ballots to BJP representatives before putting them in the ballot box.\nThe MLAs are not allowed to show their ballots to anybody other than the authorised polling agent of their party, Gohil said.\nBoth these MLAs voted for Rajput instead of voting for Ahmed Patel. However, as the votes were held invalid, Patel was declared the winner (along with BJP\xe2\x80\x99s Amit Shah and Union minister Smriti Irani). Had Patel got less than 44 votes, Rajput could have won with second preference votes from the BJP.\nRajput urged in his petition that the EC\xe2\x80\x99s order be set aside, as it was \xe2\x80\x9cpatently illegal\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOnce the returning officer had exercised his discretion of accepting these two votes as valid, the EC had no power to hear any appeal against the order. The only remedy the aggrieved party had was to move a court, it said.\nRajput also alleged that Patel won because of \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt\xe2\x80\x9d practices.\nTwo other MLAs of Congress had also shown their ballots to unauthorised persons, and these two votes, which went to Patel, must also be held invalid, the petition said. If these two votes were rejected, Rajput would get more votes, and hence he should be declared as elected to the Rajya Sabha in place of Patel, it said.\n'

S'It doesn\'t inspire confidence that the US Navy manages to crash another of its top-notch warships - on the same day that it launches military drills off Korea; drills which could spark an accidental nuclear war.\nIf the US Navy can\'t control its own vessels in normal civilian maritime situations, what does that say about the competence, or lack of, in nail-biting war scenarios?\nIn the latest incident, the guided-missile destroyer USS John S McCain collided with an oil tanker near Singapore. This was the fourth major accident involving the US Navy this year \xe2\x80\x94 and all were in Asia-Pacific. Ten American sailors are missing and, from the extensive damage to the ship, presumed dead.\nAs one flabbergasted US military pundit told CNN: "How does a state-of-the-art navy destroyer equipped with multiple radar systems and communications gear with a full-bridge watch not see, detect and evade a 30,000 ton slow-moving (10 knots) behemoth?"\nThe US destroyer in question is fitted with the Aegis anti-missile system, which is supposed to be the apex of American technology for this kind of weaponry. There are reportedly 14 such vessels operated by the US 7th Fleet in the Asia-Pacific. The ships are purported to be a key part of the defense system for the US and its allies against North Korean ballistic weapons.\nIf these elite warships can\'t avoid running into oil tankers, it doesn\'t say much about their ability to detect and zap supersonic enemy ballistic missiles hurtling across the stratosphere. The incompetence of US forces only adds to the uncertain tensions that have gripped the region in the nuclear stand-off between Washington and North Korea.\nNorth Korea this week repeated its warning that the war games being conducted by the US and its South Korean ally over the next two weeks are a reckless move that could trigger "an uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war".\nStill Washington has gone ahead with its annual war drill off Korea \xe2\x80\x94 involving massive land, sea and air maneuvers \xe2\x80\x94 despite calls from both China and Russia for the games to be cancelled as a concession to reduce tensions with North Korea.\nThe latest collision between an Aegis-equipped US destroyer and an oil tanker is an emphatic reminder that accidents can happen even with supposedly sophisticated weapons systems. Given the knife-edge standoff between the US and North Korea this kind of risk-taking by Washington in holding its war drills is doubly reprehensible.\nEvery year that US forces conduct these war maneuvers off Korea, the North Koreans protest that they are a provocation signaling a rehearsal for an American military invasion.\nThis year\'s war drills are especially fraught after US President Trump warned earlier this month that American military would unleash "fire and fury like the world has never seen before" on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. Trump\'s words implied a pre-emptive strike by the US with nuclear weapons.\nNorth Korea responded with threats to launch a ballistic missile strike near the American Pacific island territory of Guam, where the US has nuclear-capable B-1 bombers based. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un backed off the strike plan on Guam, saying he would judge forthcoming "foolish Yankee" actions.\nOver the next two weeks, the giant war maneuvers being held by US forces in conjunction with South Korean and Japanese military, could spark an all-out war with North Korea. If a war were to erupt, it would most probably involve the use of nuclear weapons, with catastrophic human and ecological consequences.\nThe accident-prone US navy only adds to the anxiety that a war could be stumbled into. That is precisely why China and Russia called on all sides de-escalate military forces and to make diplomacy and dialogue a paramount priority.\nWith typical arrogance, however, the Americans are pushing ahead to escalate the situation, making the absurd claim that the Korean war drills are "only defensive".\nThe Washington Times reports illogically with the headline: "US-South Korean troops start military drills amid North Korea\'s threats".\nThe double standards are risible. When Russia holds war maneuvers on its own territory, Washington and its NATO allies routinely decry those drills as "offensive" to European security. Yet, when Washington conducts land, sea and air operations involving up to 70,000 troops and "decapitation strikes" against North Korea, well, then the maneuvers are said to be "defensive".\nThe other irony about the US naval crashes is that Washington claims that its vessels are present in the Asia-Pacific in order to guarantee "freedom of navigation". The Americans allege that China is flexing its military muscles in the region and thereby threatening the free movement of international merchant ships.\nBefore the latest collision this week with an oil tanker off Singapore, earlier in June another Aegis-equipped US destroyer crashed into a cargo ship off Japan. That incident resulted in the death of seven US crew members. Just last week the commanders of the USS Fitzgerald were dismissed from their posts for incompetence following a navy inquiry.\nIn May, another US guided-missile warship was in a collision with a South Korean fishing vessel. A fourth accident this year was when a US warship ran aground while approaching Japan.\nThe deadly record of American navy incompetence is due in part because of Washington\'s unprecedented military build-up in one of the most congested merchant shipping routes in the world. Nearly 25 per cent of all global commodities are shipped through the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea. Over 200 cargo ships pass through the narrow 2.8-km-wide Strait of Malacca every day, near where the US destroyer collided with the oil tanker this week.\nGiven the frequency of ramming on the high seas caused by US navy vessels, it begs the question: what freedom of navigation is Washington supposedly ensuring?\nBut, primarily, the most serious danger from US forces is the incompetence in handling supposedly hi-tech weapons systems in a region that is already on a knife-edge for a nuclear war. The American recklessness is criminal.\nThat\'s why with the US Navy lumbering around, no wonder one gets an eery sinking feeling.\nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Sputnik.\n'

S'Islamabad: Pakistan is bracing for a "tough time" and may have to seek even "deeper" ties with China and Russia to offset any fallout from the Donald Trump administration\'s new Afghan strategy, according to a media report in Islamabad on Monday.\nRepresentational image. Reuters\nTrump is set to announce the much-awaited new strategy for war-torn Afghanistan on Monday night local time (Tuesday morning in South Asia).\nReports have said the Trump administration looked into possibilities of a role for India during its policy review and US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis on Sunday confirmed that the new policy was a full "South Asia strategy."\nIn a report, The Express Tribune quoted at least two "senior officials familiar with the plan" that Pakistan was contemplating various options to offset any fallout from the new Afghan strategy.\nThe report said officials in Pakistan admitted that given the signals coming from Washington, Islamabad\'s patience would certainly be tested in the coming months.\nIn the event of any extreme US measures, one official told the daily, Pakistan would be left with "no option but to seek even deeper and enhanced cooperation" with China and Russia.\nPakistan and China share an "all weather ties". Leaders of the two countries have called the relationship as that of "iron brothers". Their cooperation have moved upwards after Beijing announced the \'One Belt, One Road\' (OBOR) initiative a few years ago.\nA part of the ambitious initiative, the $50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\nPakistan\'s ties with Russia also appeared to have moved past the bitter Cold War hostilities, the report claimed.\n"If the US does not consider our legitimate concerns and just toes India\'s line, then we will certainly move closer to China and Russia," the official said, referring to Pakistan\'s first "contingency plan."\nThe new US strategy for Afghanistan is likely to seek tough measures against Pakistan to persuade it to break its nexus with some militant groups including the Haqqani Network.\nA series of recent developments including statements from senior Trump administration officials suggested that consensus was emerging in Washington to talk tough with Pakistan.\nA report in Foreign Policy magazine claimed that Trump was mulling cutting off all military aid to Pakistan because he believes "Washington is being ripped off by Islamabad".\nPakistani officials, however, believe the US\' approach seemed to be aimed at "keeping us on our toes and under pressure".\n"Given the signals we are getting, we don\'t expect anything positive in the new Afghan strategy," said the official, who requested his identity be withheld because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n"Because of Trump\'s lack of experience in dealing with delicate strategic and foreign policy issues, certain elements are taking advantage of his naivety," the official said.\nPakistan\'s emphasis has been on avoiding force and on the need for peace talks to end the stalemate in Afghanistan. But Trump administration is reportedly looking to send additional troops to the war-torn country.\n"What difference can 4,000 to 5,000 additional troops make," another official said.\nThe US has consistently asked Pakistan to not allow its soil against its neighbours. US Central Command chief General Joseph Votel, who visited Pakistan recently, repeated the demand in a meeting with Islamabad\'s top civil and military leadership.\nPolicymakers in Islamabad and Rawalpindi were also upset by Washington\'s recent decision to declare Hizbul Mujahideen a terrorist outfit. The Foreign Office publically spoke about it, calling the move "unjustified" and "disappointing". \n'

S' Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence system that can decode brain signals, a development that may help severely paralysed patients communicate with their thoughts. \n Artificial intelligence has far outpaced human intelligence in certain tasks. \n Researchers from University Hospital Freiburg in Germany led by neuroscientist Tonio Ball showed how a self-learning algorithm decodes human brain signals that were measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). \n It included not just performed movements, but also hand and foot movements that were merely thought of, or an imaginary rotation of objects. The system could be used for early detection of epileptic seizures, communicating with severely paralysed patients or making automatic neurological diagnosis. \xe2\x80\x9cOur software is based on brain-inspired models that have proven to be most helpful to decode various natural signals such as phonetic sounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Tibor Schirrmeister, University Hospital Freiburg. \n Information processing \n \xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing about the program is we needn\xe2\x80\x99t predetermine any characteristics. The information is processed layer for layer, that is, in multiple steps with the help of a non-linear function,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schirrmeister. \n \xe2\x80\x9cThe system learns to recognise and differentiate between certain behavioural patterns from various movements as it goes along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n The model is based on the connections between nerve cells in the human body in which electric signals from synapses are directed from cellular protuberances to the cell\xe2\x80\x99s core and back again. \n Decoding  \n Until now, it had been problematic to interpret the network\xe2\x80\x99s circuitry after the learning process had been completed. All algorithmic processes take place in the background and are invisible. \n That is why the researchers developed the software to create cards from which they could understand the decoding decisions. The researchers can insert new datasets into the system at any time. \n \xe2\x80\x9cOur vision for the future includes self-learning algorithms that can reliably and quickly recognise the user\xe2\x80\x99s various intentions based on their brain signals. In addition, such algorithms could assist neurological diagnoses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ball, head investigator of the study published in the journal Human Brain Mapping. \n'

S'I have always been an \xe2\x80\x98artist\xe2\x80\x99, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize what that meant until my mental illness appeared. I despise the term \xe2\x80\x98mentally ill\xe2\x80\x99; it implies that who I am as a person is fundamentally corrupted and broken.\nUnfortunately, as soon as I tell people what I struggle with, I feel like that\xe2\x80\x99s all they see me as. They see the stigma perpetuated by the media, and the inaccurate stereotypes portrayed in Hollywood. That is precisely why I am so open about what I live with.\nMore info: Instagram\nMy name is Kate and I\xe2\x80\x99m an 18-year-old artist with schizophrenia\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x98diagnosed\xe2\x80\x99 with multiple labels over the years. At the age of 17 I finally was diagnosed with schizophrenia after my parents realized my mental health was getting worse\nI draw a lot of my hallucinations as drawing helps me deal with it\nIn my hallucinations I hear voices, sound effects, random noises, and I often see bugs, faces, and disembodied eyes\nInanimate objects will look like a Van Gogh painting: warped and swirly.\nI hallucinate bugs quite often, and my depression makes me feel worthless like a fly. These bug illustrations represent my illness\nThis is a quote by an artist named Jory, and it was something that spoke to me. \nThis one crawls out of the vent in my ceiling and makes clicking noises, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll see it crawl out from underneath things\nThis is a self-portrait. I looked in the mirror and my eyes did this thing. I painted it\nI have a lot of intense emotions, and hear voices telling me to light things on fire\nHere is an example of the disembodied eyes I see. They surface in a mounds or masses on my walls or floors. They warp and move.\nThis is Birdie, she sings to me\nMy self esteem is at its lowest, and I feel insignificant. I always wish I could shapeshift into a \xe2\x80\x9cprettier\xe2\x80\x9d person\nWhat eyes sometimes look like, with more of those odd colors and circles\nOrganization, communication, paranoia, depression, anxiety, and managing my emotions are the biggest struggles for me\nWhat I live with isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy and it can be debilitating, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not living out on the streets screaming about alien abductions. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say there aren\xe2\x80\x99t people out there who are that severe \xe2\x80\x93 there are. However, there are also people like me who just stay at home most of the time cooped up in their room. It is a spectrum of symptoms with varying severity levels. Each person\xe2\x80\x99s experience is unique.\n'

S'People in North America are all set to experience a total Solar Eclipse that will take place in parts of the United States on August 21. This sporadic astronomical event is expected to captivate people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes across the world on an early afternoon in the USA.\nA total Solar Eclipse takes place when the Moon slips between the Earth and the Sun and as the diameter of the Moon appears to be the same size as that of the Sun, it covers its light resulting in a complete darkness, also called the period of totality.\nThe Solar Eclipse is expected to initiate at around 12 PM (EDT) in Oregon and will cross U.S from Oregon to South Carolina. The eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT.\nScientists from all across the world have been anticipating this event for years when the Moon will completely block the Sun thereby blacking out the path of the eclipse. This celestial event is of a special importance in the U.S as the total solar eclipse sweeping across the United States is taking place after almost a century and is called the \xe2\x80\x98Great American Eclipse.\xe2\x80\x99 The last time, Unites States witnessed a complete Solar Eclipse was in the year 1918.\nRelated Post\nIn addition, NASA is all prepared to capture all and every moment of this astronomical event with 11 space crafts and approx. 50 high-altitude balloons. NASA also claims that the moon\xe2\x80\x99s shadow will blanket almost 14 states in the United States in darkness for at least two minutes during the afternoon.\nHowever, it is not visible in India and hence, its impact is not relevant to the land of cultural diversity. Though a partial eclipse will be visible in Ireland, Northern Ireland, northern England, and Scotland.\nAs per the Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service\xe2\x80\x99s, cloud cover will be less in Oregon and the Tennessee Valley and hence the weather conditions are promising for a complete solar eclipse. A cloudy sky is anticipated in Nebraska with chances of showers in St. Louis. On the other hand, the view of the eclipse in Charleston can be affected by a storm system near Florida.\n'

S" You've signed the offer, now what? \nThe rate of change in technology is unmatched. Companies are constantly being funded, getting acquired and, unfortunately, going out of business. These dynamic conditions create both challenges and opportunities for leaders. Changing roles is becoming more frequent across industries. Being able to successfully transition into a new leadership position is a must-have skill for entrepreneurs and company leaders. \nWhether joining a company during a turnaround or at a time of explosive growth, the first 100 days are a critical time to make a positive impression and lay a meaningful foundation for the future. \nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a six-step philosophy to help ensure a strong start in your new leadership role: \n1. Listen and learn.\nYou were hired because you bring a lot to your new role and company. But, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much to learn! And it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon you to create an environment that maximizes your ability to do so. Create as many opportunities as you can to meet, build rapport with and establish immediate connections with employees, customers and other key stakeholders. Ask what\xe2\x80\x99s working, what\xe2\x80\x99s not working, where they need help, what could be better about the company and what they\xe2\x80\x99d do if they were you. And then listen. While many leaders are often prominent communicators, the importance of listening is often undervalued, overlooked and underused. This will greatly inform your strategic agenda, help you get to know your new team and give you a great sense of the existing culture, good and bad. \nIn my first 100 days, I committed myself to setting up at least 100 1:1\xe2\x80\x99s and team meetings with employees of all levels, customers, investors, partners, vendors and analysts. I also set expectations on my first day that this was on my agenda so people were ready with their feedback -- and believe me, they were!\n2. Overcommunicate, connect, establish trust and open the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual door.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTell people what you are going to do, do it and tell them what you learned. Transparency, action and follow-up are key for building relationships and trust with both customers and employees. Be visible and be responsive. Ensure people know where to find you and that you are open to ideas, thoughts and feedback, good and bad. \nWhile I\xe2\x80\x99ve embraced the open-door policy by locating my desk in the same open environment as all employees, I\xe2\x80\x99ve also pushed open the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual door\xe2\x80\x9d by communicating activities and progress early, and often to set a precedence for transparency. It\xe2\x80\x99s critical for employees to consistently have a good level of visibility into where the company is thriving as well as areas that require improvement. It\xe2\x80\x99s equally important that they have the confidence to voice their opinions. \n3. Slow down to speed up.\nAs a leader, there are often expectations to deliver results immediately. While this can be true, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to fight the temptation to jump into action. Slow the pace in the beginning and fully analyze what the current state of the business and opportunities. Leaders who take a more thoughtful approach in the beginning will see higher quality results in the long run, and will also have more organizational buy-in.\nWhen I stepped into my role at Couchbase, there were a lot of projects underway. I intentionally put a few on hold to ensure they would align with our go-forward plans. \n4. Establish a parallel plan for product and market learning.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t exist within a bubble. New leaders must not only understand their company and products, but also the wider market landscape. Know your customers and understand what your competitors are doing.\nWhile you have a lot to learn, the company must continue to perform. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overburden your team with your personal education. Determine what you can do on your own to get up to speed. Test out your sales enablement training. Get your hands on as many analyst reports as possible. Review past board decks. Look through team presentations. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of content out there, so take advantage of it. \n5. Integrate into the cadence of company.\nUnderstand how the company operates. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to familiarize yourself with the pace and comfort level of the company\xe2\x80\x99s and employees\xe2\x80\x99 operations. As a new leader, if you enter a position and vastly redesign your employees\xe2\x80\x99 roles and pace too quickly, they\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to experience greater amounts of stress and new leader rejection. While innovation is important, understanding the pace at which change can effectively be implemented is essential.\nI started with what is working for the company. If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t broken, don\xe2\x80\x99t fix it. I have not modified the setup for staff meetings, timing and cadence (though content changed immediately). The same held true for our sales forecasting process, at least for the first quarter. Results matter, so ensure your entry isn\xe2\x80\x99t disrupting short-term execution.\n6. React to mission critical situations.\nLearning and building a foundation for the future is essential, but never forget that you have a company to run and that responsibility can be delegated. You must take action in critical situations, whether internal or external, that threaten the success and growth of your overall business. Issues will arise, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal, a sudden change in the market or a sensitive employee issue. Be prepared to be flexible.\n"

S'The Chinese have long realised that technology is the cutting edge in modern combat. Accordingly, China has embarked on an ambitious programme to revamp its technological capability and this process is likely to take between fifteen to twenty years. Evidence suggests the PLA is engaged in a sustained effort to interdict, at long ranges, aircraft carrier and expeditionary strike groups that might deploy in the Western Pacific. Following the experience of US intervention with Carrier Battle Groups during the 1995 and 1996 Taiwan Strait crises, evidence suggests the Chinese military has invested in research, development, and technology acquisition oriented on anti-carrier operations. Similarly, China\xe2\x80\x99s placement of long-range SAM systems capable of providing coverage over Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s airspace, combined with expansion of SRBM and amphibious forces, has introduced a destabilising capability.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should achieve developments by leaps and bounds in the modernisation of weaponry in our armed forces.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94General Li Jinai\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have placed a near-term emphasis on asymmetric programmes and systems to leverage China\xe2\x80\x99s advantages while exploiting the perceived vulnerabilities of potential opponents\xe2\x80\xa6\nChina has stated its intentions and allocated resources to pursue a broad-based military build-up encompassing force-wise professionalisation, improved training, more robust and realistic joint exercises as also accelerated acquisition of modern weapons. The Intelligence Community estimates that China will take until the end of this decade or later for its military modernisation programme to produce a modern force capable of defeating a moderate-size adversary. Recognising this deficiency, China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have placed a near-term emphasis on asymmetric programmes and systems to leverage China\xe2\x80\x99s advantages while exploiting the perceived vulnerabilities of potential opponents \xe2\x80\x93 so-called Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Mace (Sha Shou Jian) programmes. Although military modernisation figured last among Deng Xiao Ping\xe2\x80\x99s Four Modernisation, there are increasing signs that China has embarked on its military modernisation to turn its People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Army (PLA) into a modern force capable of defeating a moderate size adversary.\nThe Chinese have long realised that technology is the cutting edge in modern combat. Accordingly, China has embarked on an ambitious programme to revamp its technological capability and this process is likely to take between 15 to 20 years. Evidence suggests the PLA is engaged in a sustained effort to develop the capability to interdict at long range, aircraft carrier and expeditionary strike groups that might deploy in the Western Pacific. Following the experience of US intervention with Carrier Battle Groups during the 1995 and 1996 Taiwan Strait crises, evidence suggests the Chinese military has invested in research, development and technology acquisition oriented on anti-carrier operations. Similarly, China\xe2\x80\x99s placement of long-range SAM systems capable of providing coverage over Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s airspace, combined with expansion of SRBM and amphibious forces, has introduced a destabilising capability.\nAs far as technological advancement of the PLA Ground Force is concerned, it will have the following postulates:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improvement in the battlefield survivability of Armoured and Mechanised Forces\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fire power, synchronisation and economy of force.\nPLA planners are focused on targeting surface ships and submarines at long ranges\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operational concepts aimed at preventing an adversary from deploying military forces to forward operating locations and thus, rapidly destabilise critical military balance.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Emphasis on asymmetric programmes and systems to leakage China\xe2\x80\x99s advantages while exploiting the vulnerabilities of potential opponents.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Creation of Rapid Reaction Force in order to respond in real time to rapidly changing battle scenario.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Capability to launch precision strikes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improving expeditionary operation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Logistics reforms for integration of the civil sector with military procurement system and acquire dual technology.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strategic reconnaissance capability.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Network Centric operations.\nThe Most Likely Military Strategy\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Emphasis on active defence.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Control and use of Armed Forces and other coercive instrument of power essential components of security strata.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Coercive military capabilities including air power, missiles and information about operations.\nChina is developing forces and concepts focused on denying an adversary the ability to deploy to locations from which it can conduct military operations\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Employment of ground forces for final \xe2\x80\x98shock value\xe2\x80\x99 to destroy adversary\xe2\x80\x99s will to resist.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Creation of Rapid Reaction Formations (RRF) equipped with hi-tech weapons for flexible use in regional contingencies.\nThe Most Likely Modernisation Strategy\n\xe2\x80\xa2 New ideas are being studied to incorporate new concepts including rethinking assumptions about the value of long-range precision strikes, independent of ground forces, in a Taiwan conflict scenario, integration of psychological operations with air and rapid ground operations and improving joint operations capability by developing advance C4ISR systems and improving inter-service cooperation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Increased interaction and cooperation with foreign military to improve political and military ties.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 China\xe2\x80\x99s extensive and well established ballistic missile industrial infrastructure continues to concentrate on replacing liquid propellant missiles with mobile solid propellant ones, reflecting concerns for survivability, maintenance and reliability as also developing high priority ICBMs for theatre and strategic missions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Research and development to produce a variety of systems including tactical and special purpose (aerial refueling tankers, airborne early warning and electronic counter measures) aircraft as well as modern turbofan engine technology.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Building modern and combat-capable surface combatants, submarines and amphibious vessels.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Producing advanced armoured systems, upgrading older models and developing next generation missiles.\nDoctrine\nMao\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine of a People\xe2\x80\x99s War has now been revamped to cater for the following three possibilities:\nPLA planners have observed the primacy of precision strike in modern warfare and are investing in both the offensive and defensive elements of this emerging regime\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A People\xe2\x80\x99s War under modern conditions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Local war under hi-tech conditions (jubu zhanzhing zai gao jishu tiaojian xia)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Asymmetric warfare (bu dimchen zhan zheng)\nForce Restructuring\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Force Restructuring programme is based on the following parameters:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduction in Military Regions (MR)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Merging of traditional field armies into group armies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Raising of Rapid Reaction Forces.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Raising of Special Forces.\nModernisation Parameters: Area Denial Capability\nChina is developing forces and concepts focused on denying an adversary the ability to deploy to locations from which it can conduct military operations. Increasingly, China\xe2\x80\x99s area denial forces overlap, providing multiple layers of offensive capability. PLA planners are focused on targeting surface ships and submarines at long ranges. Analysis of current and projected force structure improvements suggest that in the near term, China is seeking the capacity to hold surface ships at risk through a layered defence that reaches out to the \xe2\x80\x98second island chain\xe2\x80\x99. China has expressed interest in developing naval anti-access capabilities that use a comprehensive C4ISR network to direct and coordinate naval, air, space and missile forces.\nOne area of apparent investment involves the pursuit of medium-range ballistic missiles, an extensive C4ISR system for geo-location of targets and onboard guidance systems for terminal homing to strike surface ships on the high seas or their onshore support infrastructure. This capability would have particular significance for regional stability, owing to the preemptive and coercive options that it would provide China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.\nChina has accorded building a modern ISR architecture a high priority in its comprehensive military modernisation\xe2\x80\xa6\nA layered system to achieve local sea denial would also employ submarines, maritime strike aircraft, and modern surface combatants equipped with Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCMs). China\xe2\x80\x99s development of numerous varieties of mines, its acquisition of the KILO, SONG, and YUAN class diesel submarines and development of the SHANG class SSN illustrate the importance the PLA is placing on undersea warfare in its pursuit of sea denial. The purchase of two new Russian SOVREMENNYY II-class DDGs and indigenous production of the LUYANG I/LUYANGII DDGs equipped with long-range ASCM and SAM systems demonstrate a continuing emphasis on improving anti-surface warfare capabilities combined with mobile, wide area air control.\nStrengthened Nuclear Deterrence\nChina is qualitatively and quantitatively improving its long-range nuclear missile force. China is pursuing strategic forces modernisation to provide a credible, survivable nuclear deterrent and counterstrike capability in response to its perception of an increasingly complex nuclear security environment.\nClick to Buy: IDR Apr-Jun 2017\nThe PLA Second Artillery is fielding mobile, more survivable missiles capable of targeting the US, Japan, India, Russia and other targets in Asia and the rest of the world. It currently deploys approximately 20 silo-based, liquid-fuelled CSS-4 ICBMs, which constitute its primary nuclear means of holding continental US targets at risk. In addition, it maintains approximately 20 liquid-fuelled, limited range CSS-3 ICBMs that enable it to attach targets in the Asia region.\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98theatre\xe2\x80\x99 nuclear force is made up of the CSS-2 IRBMs and solid propellant, road-mobile CSS-5 MRBMs.\nBuilding Capacity for Precision Strike\nPLA planners have observed the primacy of precision strike in modern warfare and are investing in both the offensive and defensive elements of this emerging regime. China is pursuing an array of improved ISR assets ranging from UAVs, constellations of various satellites and more \xe2\x80\x98informationalised\xe2\x80\x99 Special Operations forces. Such forces could provide targeting data for long range precision strikes when strikes are linked by more robust communications systems.\nEvidence exists that China is improving its situational awareness in space, which will give it the ability to track and identify most satellites\xe2\x80\xa6\nTo carry out the precision strike, in the near future, China will have the following:\nShort Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBMs) conventionally armed.\nLand Attack Cruise Missiles (LACMs) conventionally armed.\nAir-to-Surface Missiles (ASMs)\nAnti-ship Cruise Missiles (ASCMs)\nAnti-Radiation Missiles (ARMs)\nPrecision Artillery\nImproving Expeditionary Operations\nPLA expeditionary forces include three airborne divisions, two amphibious infantry divisions, two marine brigades, about seven Special Operations groups and one regimental size reconnaissance element in the Second Artillery. The capabilities of these units are steadily improving with the introduction of new equipment, improved unit-level tactics, and greater coordination of joint operations.\nIn addition to amphibious assaults, missions for these forces could include; Special Operations to facilitate amphibious operations and disrupt communications nodes, air defence and the movement of reserve forces reacting to amphibious operations; airborne assaults to seize airfields for follow-on infantry forces and reconnaissance to provide targeting information and battle damage assessments.\nPLA ground forces in the Nanjing and Guangzhou Military Regions have received upgraded amphibious armour and other vehicles, such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers and may deploy additional armoured vehicles and air cushioned troops vehicles to improve lethality and speed for seaborne assaults. Airborne forces are likely to receive the newly purchased IL-76/CANDIDs from Russia and may acquire modern, armoured vehicles that can be airdropped. The quality and quantity of army aviation training has improved in recent years. Army aviation regiments actively study and explore new fighting tactics and training methods to increase their joint operations capability.\nChina is interested in acquiring a disaster environmental/ monitoring satellite constellation called Huanjing\xe2\x80\xa6\nExpanding Air Defence\nThe PLA has shifted from point defence of key military, industrial and political targets to a new Joint Anti-Air Raid Campaign doctrine based on a modern, integrated air defence system capable of effective Offensive Counter Air (OCA) and Defensive Counter Air (DCA). Under this doctrine, the PLA will use aircraft, surface-to-surface missiles, long range artillery, special operations forces, naval forces and guerrilla units to destroy an enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct offensive air operations and provide comprehensive defence of PRC airspace.\nSpace and Counter-space Developments\nChina has accorded building a modern ISR architecture a high priority in its comprehensive military modernisation, in particular the development of advanced space-based C4ISR and targeting capabilities. China\xe2\x80\x99s access to space will continue to improve as it develops newer boosters to replace the aging Long March system. Acquiring more sophisticated space systems will allow China to expand the reach of its anti-access forces and could serve as a key enabler for regional power projection.\nSmall Satellites\nChina is studying and seeking foreign assistance for developing small satellites. It has launched a number of them since 2000, including an oceanographic research satellite, imagery satellites and environmental research satellites. China is also developing microsatellites, weighing less than 100 kg for remote sensing and networks of electro-optical and radar satellites. These developments could allow for a more rapid reconstitution or expansion of their satellite force given any disruption in coverage.\nAnti-Satellite (ASAT) Weapons\nBeijing continues to pursue an offensive anti-satellite system. China can currently destroy or disable satellites only by launching a ballistic missile or space-launch vehicle armed with a nuclear weapon. However, there are many risks associated with this method including adverse consequences from the use of nuclear weapons. Evidence exists that China is improving its situational awareness in space, which will give it the ability to track and identify most satellites. Such capability will allow for the de-confliction of Chinese satellites, and would also be required for offensive action. At least one of the satellite attack systems appears to be a ground-based laser designed to damage or blind imaging satellites.\nThe PLA considers active offence to be the most important requirement for information warfare to destroy or disrupt an adversary\xe2\x80\x99s capability to receive and process data\xe2\x80\xa6\nEnhanced Reconnaissance Capability\nChina participated in the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) programme with the CBERS-1 and CBERS-2 remote sensing satellites. These satellites can take 20 metre resolution images in swaths exceeding 100 kilometres and transmit those digital images to earth stations. The programme will continue with follow-on satellite CBERS-2B, CBERS-3 and CBERS-4 which reportedly increase camera resolution substantially.\nChina is interested in acquiring a disaster environmental/monitoring satellite constellation called Huanjing. Phase 1 of the programme calls for three satellites, two of which are equipped for visible, infrared and multi-spectral imaging while the third will possess a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to see through weather. Phase 2 of the Huanjing programme allows for eight satellites (four imaging and four SAR) in orbit simultaneously.\nIn the next decade, Beijing most likely will field radar, ocean surveillance and high resolution photoreconnaissance satellites. China will eventually deploy advanced imagery, reconnaissance and Earth resource systems with military applications. In the interim, China probably will supplement existing coverage with commercial SPOT, LANDSAT, RADARSAT Ikonos and Russian satellite imagery.\nExploiting Information Warfare\nThe PLA considers active offence to be the most important requirement for information warfare to destroy or disrupt an adversary\xe2\x80\x99s capability to receive and process data. Launched mainly by remote combat and covert methods, the PLA could employ information warfare preemptively to gain the initiative in a crisis. Specified information warfare objectives include the targeting and destruction of an enemy\xe2\x80\x99s command system, shortening the duration of war, minimising casualties on both sides, enhancing operational efficiency, reducing effects on domestic populations and gaining support from the international community. The PLA\xe2\x80\x99s information warfare practices also reflect investment in electronic countermeasures and defence against electronic attack (e.g. electronic and infrared decoys, angle reflectors and false target generators).\nThe PLA is expected to field the extended range S-300PMU2, which will allow the Chinese to engage targets over Taiwan airspace\xe2\x80\xa6\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s Future Technological Profile: 2020\nLand-Based Missile Technology\nGround-based cruise missile capability is likely to have been developed. In addition, ground silo-based CSS-4, CSS-3, CSS-5 solid fuel ICBMS, road mobile DF31 and DF31A would have been developed.\nAir Defence\nThe most important aspect of the PLA\xe2\x80\x99s Air Defence development has been the acquisition and fielding of advanced, Russian made SA-10 SAM systems and their placement along the Taiwan Strait. The PLA is also working to reverse-engineer a domestic variant of the SA-10 (the HQ 9) of equal capability. This year, the PLA is expected to field the extended range S-300PMU2, which will allow China to engage targets over Taiwan airspace.\nRadio Frequency and Laser Weapon Development\nLong range beam weapons would use narrow radio frequency beams to engage targets such as aircraft or Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs). Short-range systems would be packed into missiles or artillery shells and launched into the vicinity of targets such as radars or command posts before releasing an RF pulse. In recent years, the application of RF weapons has expanded to include deployment on small vehicles or in suitcases for targeting critical military or civilian infrastructures where close access is possible.\nComputer Network Operations\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s Computer Network Operations (CNO) include computer network attack, computer network defence and computer network exploitation. The PLA sees CNO as critical to seize the initiative and achieve \xe2\x80\x98electromagnetic dominance\xe2\x80\x99 early in a conflict and as a force multiplier. Although there is no evidence of a formal Chinese CNO doctrine, PLA theorists have coined the term \xe2\x80\x9cIntegrated Network Electronic Warfare\xe2\x80\x9d to outline the integrated use of electronic warfare, CNO and limited kinetic strikes against key C4 nodes to disrupt the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s battlefield network information systems. The PLA has established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks.\nCommand, Control, Communications and Computers (C4)\nChina is continuing to develop a joint Battle Management System which the entire PLA will use for strategic, campaign, tactical planning and operations.\nClick to Buy: IDR Apr-Jun 2017\nSocialisation of Logistics\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s logistics reform features the integration of the civil sector with the military procurement system as a modern adaptation of \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s War\xe2\x80\x9d. Under this concept, the PLA will acquire common and dual-use items on the market. Increasing number of logistics functions will be outsourced, especially when civilian industry can perform similar functions at low costs.\n'

S"The exhibition titled \xe2\x80\x9cIsmael Smith, the Beauty and the Monsters\xe2\x80\x9d featuring the works of Spanish visual artist Ismael Smith is on view at Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona.\nThe selection of works on display explores the artistic career of Ismael Smith. His work involved the depiction of grotesque or expressionistic deformations. The sexual ambiguity of his figures and scenes of horrific nature were part of his oeuvre. These were an ill fit for the Mediterranean nature and could only be placed in the genre of Modernism. Famous during his early years, Smith left for U.S. in 1919 where he failed to gain much recognition and focused on finding a cure for cancer a subject that slowly turned into an obsession. In a tragic turn of events in 1960 against the artist\xe2\x80\x99s will, he was institutionalized at the psychiatric sanatorium in Bloomingdale outside of New York. The exhibition is divided into 5 sections dedicated to the character, the sketcher, the sculptor, the engraver, and the tragic end of the artist.\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya was built for the International Exhibition of 1929 and in 1934 it opened its doors to the public. The collection comprises of genres such as Catalan Modernism, Gothic art, European Renaissance, and Baroque works among others. In 1995 new rooms dedicated to Romanesque art were inaugurated and the collection was extended that ended in 2004 with the integration of modern art.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsmael Smith, the Beauty and the Monsters\xe2\x80\x9d runs through September 17, 2017 at Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Palau Nacional, Parc de Montju\xc3\xafc, s/n, 08038 Barcelona, Spain.\nFor details, visit: www.museunacional.cat/en\nClick on the slideshow for a sneak peek at the exhibition. \n"

S'Everyone knows Pratap Bose, Founding Partner and Chairman, The Social Street, as a passionate wildlife photographer. But if he is up in the wee hours these days, then he is probably reading his latest interest on a particular painter or on Skype with a fellow collector in another part of the world\nRoshni Nair | Mumbai | January 19, 2017\nPratap Bose\n(This is a weekly series on advertising professionals who have enriched their own lives and their audiences as performing musicians, artists, painters, actors, singers, mime artists. We will bring a new adman-performer every Thursday.)\nThe fact that Pratap Bose has a dedicated room in his house to store his art collection in a space-strapped Mumbai is testament enough of his passion for art. You can find the late Gaganendranath Tagore and the perhaps lesser known, recluse Gopikrishna, all co-existing harmoniously in his tastefully done up pad.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started collecting art very seriously about five years ago. It was always latent in me but if you ask any collector the exact reason why they started collecting, there may never be a definite answer to that question.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBorn and bought up in Kolkata to a Bengali father and a European mother, Bose was always interested in literature and art. So it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise to anyone when unlike most teenagers, he spent his first salary at an art gallery.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was probably 21 and I just got my first pay check. I went to a small art exhibition and although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about art at that point in time, there was a Chinese silk painting that I liked and I bought it, and very proudly put it up in my study.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until he met Manisha Gera Baswani, whom Bose likes to call his second Godmother, that he started to understand the nuances of art.\n\xe2\x80\x9cManisha Gera Baswani is the sister of my best friend. Her house, when I visited for the first time, was an absolute museum. I was in awe of her. She was in her lovely way, a Godmother who taught me the nuances of what is important, what to look for in an artist and who are the contemporaries making their mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHis first serious acquisition, a work by A Ramachandran, was in fact from Manisha Baswani\xe2\x80\x99s collection. It was also around that time that Bose had his first brush with auctions.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to my very first auction with my friend Varun Gera (Manisha\xe2\x80\x99s brother) about five years ago. It was at the Taj and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very big auction. I had this auction catalogue and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about the artists. On my way to the auction, I kept calling Manisha to ask whether a particular artist was good or not and what price I might have to pay. So I arrived at the auction thinking I knew a lot but now looking back today, I laugh at the novice I was then. I did raise my hand two or three times to bid but Varun kept pulling my hand down and restrained me. It was a learning experience and from that day something very strong stirred inside me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nToday, Bose has been to many an auction but he still believes that whether you are buying from live auctions, online auctions, the secondary market or from art dealers and galleries, the provenance and authenticity needs to be impeccable.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe critical thing today, when you buy, is that you must look for work that has a very strong provenance and the quality of the work. The papers, the documents, all of them need to be extremely good. You should buy from people who are trusted and come with a strong reputation on trust, values and authenticity. The art world is a strange place, and there are only a few from whom I buy because of my fetish for strong credentials.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIs there a particular style that he really likes when it comes to art?\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is the Old Bengal School of Art. The Modernists, the Souzas, the Hussains all came later. There is a lot of feeling, versatility and depth in the old school of Shantiniketan artists, and they were the first ones who consciously challenged the idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create something of their own. According to me, the old Bengal school was the beginning of the art renaissance in India.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNasreen Mohamedi is one artist Bose has been trying to add to his collection but in his own words, collecting art is an expensive hobby and you can\xe2\x80\x99t own everything you want.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen years ago, Nasreen Mohamedi was selling for about fifty thousand rupees. Now it probably sells for a crore each. Her style is straight line, geometrical drawings. For her, symmetry was everything. She suffered from a rare neurological disorder similar to Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s. Her hands would quiver, her whole body would tremble when she tried to draw but in spite of that she was always able to maintain the symmetry she was looking for. That was her style. She died very young as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBose believes that the more tragic the artist\xe2\x80\x99s life, the higher the propensity of their work selling and becoming great.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Van Gogh to any of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great painters it was always about the tragedy or hardship that the artist had to endure. We are all individuals at the end of the day and therefore those sensitivities almost always hit a raw nerve with the collectors.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSomeone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in collecting art for the badge value, Bose feels that you should only buy art that moves something in your soul.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately many of the younger generation of art collectors collect only for badge value. They want a Hussain, a Souza or a Raza because of the bragging rights attached to the name. For example, Gopikrishna is not a very expensive artist today. He might become expensive in the future but that is not why I collect his work. I buy his work because his works are like no other with his unique esoteric style, the Salvador Dali of India as I call him. So, it is not about the price you pay but about whether it stirs something inside you. At the end of the day you have to live with what is on your wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe art world will become a better place the day young collectors start collecting works that move them emotionally, and for the love and passion for art and not be swayed or influenced by the auction houses or big galleries that attempt to prop up artists and influence prices. Buy what you really really love!\xe2\x80\x9d\nWill there ever come a time when he will be ready to part with some of the paintings?\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think yes. You evolve as a collector. There are many stages in life as a collector. There comes a stage when every serious collector would have collected a lot during his/her life and then they reach a point where they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to collect anymore. They find joy in other people\xe2\x80\x99s collections and they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to own it. Those are the true collectors, who appreciate art for what art is. It takes a lot of time to reach that stage but I am not there yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'People evacuate with their belongings in the flood-hit Gazole in the Malda district of West Bengal Aug. 19, 2017. (IANS photo)\nMALDA \xe2\x80\x94 The ongoing West Bengal flooding has claimed 152 lives and caused losses to the tune of Rs. 14,000 crore in 11 districts, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said Aug. 21 after visiting three northern districts where large areas continued to be submerged.\n"The floods have caused losses totaling almost Rs. 14,000 crore in 11 districts of the state. So far, there are reports of 152 deaths due to various causes like drowning, snake bites, etc. in the state in the ongoing floods. 1.5 crore people have been affected," she said.\nHitting out at the Center, she said the government should ensure that barrage dredging is properly executed.\n"The floods have taken place due to the release of water by the DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) and Farakka Barrage. The state of the reservoirs and river beds has become such that people are getting hit more by the release of water rather than by rains," she alleged.\n"Bengal has become like a boat. Neither the Farakka Barrage nor the reservoirs under the DVC are dredged," she further said.\nBanerjee said 45 lakh people have been affected in the three north Bengal districts \xe2\x80\x93 Malda, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur \xe2\x80\x93 which she toured during the day Aug. 21.\nShe said about four lakh tents have been distributed and that more will be provided.\n"There is enough aid material. We are not stingy about distributing them. Many speed boats are also operating in the flooded areas for distributing relief," she said.\nThe chief minister visited multiple inundated areas, spoke with those affected by the flooding and instructed the administration to quickly provide relief and rehabilitation, and begin reconstruction as soon as possible.\nThe Trinamool Congress leader also requested central aid for all flood-hit states.\n"The central government has provided aid packages worth Rs. 2,000 crore each to Gujarat and Assam. All states must get central aid. Bengal has been less affected by floods than Gujarat and Assam. We would send a detailed report and expect the help which is needed," Banerjee said.\n"I have also written to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few times regarding the erosion of the Ganga\'s banks but no actions have been taken," she alleged.\nIn Malda, she met with the district magistrates, superintendents of police and senior officials of the three affected districts. Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim, the state chief secretary, the home secretary and relief department officials were present.\nBanerjee directed the officials to ensure there was sufficient medicine to manage any disease outbreaks that may occur once water levels subside.\nThe flood situation in northern West Bengal had overall improved, with the exception of the Malda district where nearly five blocks were still inundated by the rising Mahananda River waters.\n"This situation is due to the water level of the river," she told locals.\nFloods have wreaked havoc in the Cooch Behar, South Dinajpur, North Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Malda districts of north Bengal.\nAccording to the State Irrigation Department, heavy downpours in Nepal and Bihar are worsening the situation as the waters they release are entering the Mahananda.\nThey reported that the Mahananda was flowing 1.5 meters above the extreme danger level in the English Bazar area, while other rivers in the area have also breached the danger level.\nThe State Finance Department was collaborating with other departments, including its irrigation counterpart, to formulate a report on the overall flood situation and damage to the state, said state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee.\n"The report will be submitted to the chief secretary and chief minister in about a week," he said.\n'

S" 'Sowcarpettai' is yet another horror film with Srikanth and Raai Laxmi in the lead. Srikanth has played dual roles as the elder and younger son of Thalaivasal Vijay and Rekha. Junior Srikanth and Raai Laxmi fall for each other during their school days itself. On knowing this, their parents give their nod for their marriage.\n Amidst this, senior Srikanth develops a liking towards Raai Laxmi and tries to attain her at any cost. When this matter gets exposed, the parents send him out of their house. On the other hand, Suman who lives in Sowcarpet, lends money for higher interest rates and acquires the properties of the defaulters. Thalaivasal Vijay happens to be one among the defaulters, and Suman murders Vijay, Rekha, junior Srikanth and Raai Laxmi to take over their house. The deceased lovers turn into ghosts and try to take vengeance on Suman. Will they succeed in their plans and what happens to the elder Srikanth is narrated in the rest of the story.\n Having played two characters, actor Srikanth is able to show the differences in an effective manner and has put in extra efforts compared to his previous films. Raai Laxmi attracts the audience with her hot looks and performance. Suman, Singampuli, Thalaivasal Vijay and Rekha have done their given jobs.\n Songs are okay in John Peter's music and the loud BGM score is supposed to jolt us. The cinematography of Srinivasa Reddy and the visual effects are on the tacky side. On the whole, 'Sowcarpettai' is a forgettable outing for director V.C.Vadivudaiyaan and team. And for the viewers, it's safe to skip this one.\n"

S'Photo Credit: gypsyschnecke, Pixabay.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Our thanks to guest author Jessica Brody, host of the blog OurBestFriends.pet. \nAfter researching how much time, energy, and money is required for different types of pets, you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to get a dog, and you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for the commitment. Now you have to decide which breed of dog to choose, as they all come with different requirements. Before you adopt a dog, you\xe2\x80\x99ll also need to prepare your home, learn what types of activities to do with your dog, and know how to bond with him or her.\nChoosing a Breed\nWhen deciding which breed is right for you, determine the main purpose your dog will serve in your life. From a hunting partner to a guard dog to a playmate, dogs can serve different purposes. There are a wide variety of hunting dogs that are specific to the game that\xe2\x80\x99s being hunted. Also, there are different types of guard dogs. Research which breed works specifically for your need.\nIf your dog will simply be a playmate or companion, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to look more closely at your lifestyle, space, and activity level, which will help you pick a size, hair coat, and behavior type. If you like things tidier, avoid dogs that are prone to heavy shedding. Hair coat will also determine grooming frequency, so consider that as well. Be realistic about the space you have available, and keep that in mind when choosing a breed.\nWhen dogs don\xe2\x80\x99t get the proper amount of exercise for their needs, it can cause them to misbehave. If you\xe2\x80\x99re more of a couch potato, a Jack Russell terrier is probably not the best fit for you, but a bulldog could be a better fit. Although some dogs need more exercise than others, all dogs need to be walked for at least 15 minutes twice a day. If you have a busy schedule or work long hours, you may need to hire a dog walker to ensure your pet gets adequate exercise.\nHelping Your Pet Acclimate to Your Home\nBefore bringing your pet home, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to dog-proof your house. Tape loose electrical cords to baseboards, and move household chemicals to high shelves. You may also need to install gates and remove plants, rugs, and breakables. To ensure there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing dangerous on the floor, lie down to get a dog\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view.\nTo help your pet to be comfortable and quickly adjust, have all supplies purchased before picking him or her up. Necessary items include collar, leash, food and water bowls, bedding, crate, toys, and grooming supplies. When you pick up your dog, find out what he or she has been fed and on what schedule. Stick to that schedule for a few days, and if you wish to change the food, slowly transition to a new food over a week.\nAs soon as you get home, allow your pet to have a potty break before taking him or her inside. Dogs thrive on schedules, so create a plan for feeding, walks, naps, and playtime. Playtime and exercise are important, but your dog also needs alone time to rest. If your dog is new to alone time, he or she may voice objections. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give in and comfort him, or you may create a monster,\xe2\x80\x9d warns PetFinder.\nBonding with Your Pet\nBonding with your new pet is also important. The most obvious way to bond with your dog is to give him or her lots of attention. Make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s quality attention; your dog will notice the difference between an absent-minded head scratch while you text and a full-on belly rub session.\nAny activities you guys do together will promote bonding. Daily training builds communication between you and your dog, which also helps the two of you bond. Daily playtime and walks are equally important for bonding, as well as for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical health. Even simple and small things like cuddling and car rides are fun activities that strengthen your bond.\nRemember to give pet ownership time. From training to bonding, everything will improve with time and patience. Once you made the decision that a dog is the right pet for you, be sure to learn about different breeds so you pick the best breed for you and your lifestyle. Take the time to prepare your home and work on bonding with your pet to ensure you and your dog have a strong and healthy relationship.\n'

S'(Representative image/ ThinkStock Photos)\nFirst-time entrepreneurs often find themselves in over their heads while negotiating with angels investors or VCs, who have more experience and money \n MUMBAI: There is always a gap between what an investor thinks is fair \xe2\x80\x94 whether the terms of funding or valuation \xe2\x80\x94 and what a founder thinks he ought to get. Founders, especially first time entrepreneurs, can find negotiations with angel investors and early stage ventures challenging. \n So, founders need to do their homework and be prepared for what will come up during discussions. "Being street-smart is vital," says a founder of an e-learning portal. He narrates that a potential angel investor wanted his startup to pay for the cost of due diligence (including travel and stay). Wiser from this experience, the founder advocates doing a background check of individual investors or better yet, pitching to reputed angel groups. "Two or more members of an angel group pool their money, which means more funds. Plus they bring diverse expertise to the table, which is a value add for any startup," he adds. \n Anjana Vivek, founder director of VentureBean Consulting, says founders should choose their first investors wisely. "Investors are not out to cheat gullible founders, but they do have the money power, knowledge and experience. In their eagerness for funds, founders must not ignore the fine print. After all, the first valuation impacts subsequent ones or giving up wide-ranging decision making rights can be detrimental," she says. \n Negotiations result in drawing up of the term sheet, a document outlining the terms under which an investor will provide funds, and it is a blueprint for the legal agreements that follow. Angel investors are more flexible whereas venture capital firms tend to stick to standard clauses. \n1. PERSONAL LIABILITY \n "In early stage companies, investors usually ask for a personal indemnity from the founders. As the rounds of investment progress, founders should try and limit their liability and only provide for indemnity from the company," says Kartik Maheshwari, who leads startup practice at Nishith Desai Associates. \n 2. BOARD MEMBERSHIP \n Investors\' board representation should be limited to one or two investors and their voting rights must be proportionate to their shareholding. "We had the misfortune of having three investor representatives on our board, who didn\'t agree on appointment of a key hire and sent us in different directions for product diversification. Ultimately this venture floundered," recalls a former entrepreneur. \n "It\'s fair and reasonable that during each of the funding rounds, the lead investor has the right to appoint a director. The second largest investor can appoint a board observer. At times, there are two equal or near equal investors and both may be offered the right to appoint a director. As a company grows and existing investors dilute below a certain threshold limit, their right to appoint directors should fall. We do give up our board seat when we cease to be the largest or second largest investor. We also ensure that our representative director votes in the best interest of the company," says Ashish Fafadia, CFO, Blume Ventures, an early stage VC fund. "From a confidentiality perspective, founders could also request that such a director not be on the board of a competitor," adds Maheshwari. \n 3. AFFIRMATIVE VOTING \n This clause ensures that a startup can proceed with a particular course of action only after the investor\'s approval. Alok Mittal, co-founder of Indifi Technologies and a founding board member of Indian Angel Network, says: "Affirmative voting should be limited to certain issues only, such as amendment of business objectives, or issues relating to capital or key management personnel." \n Ganapathy Subramanian, serial entrepreneur and former VC, adds, "Founders must ensure that this clause is not ambiguous. They could also negotiate that if the investors don\'t act on their affirmative vote, it would be regarded as consent." \n4. SHARE CAPITAL \n As investors want founders to have their skin in the game, a lock-in period of up to five years, for all or a significant portion of shareholding, is typically prescribed. Post this, founders can sell minor stakes. Fafadia says he prefers having vesting clauses for founders \xe2\x80\x94 terms that give the company the right to purchase a percentage of a founder\'s equity if he or she decides to walk away. "This clause doesn\'t hurt founders but helps align incentives at all levels," he says, explaining with the hypothesis of one of three founders who owns 25% of the shares quitting a company after two years. The startup loses a key stakeholder, a replacement needs to be found and adjustments made. "Thus, it\'s fair that the outgoing founder leaves half of his shares that can be used, say, to hire a new senior team member. We provide a clause where shares vest over a period of four to five years, depending on the stage of the startup and the track record of the founding team," he explains. \n Generally, investors ask for the right of first refusal (ROFR). Here, if founders get an external offer at x price, they have to ask the investor to match it. Only if the investor refuses can these shares be sold to the external party. \n If ROFR exists, third parties find it less attractive to negotiate a purchase, as it\'s possible that the existing investors will scuttle the deal. "As ROFR adversely binds the founders, instead a right of first offer (ROFO) may be given if insisted upon. Under an ROFO, the investor makes an offer at x price, but the founders have the option to sell the shares to another party at a higher price," explains Mittal. \n5. EXIT CLAUSES \n A liquidity preference clause ensures that investors get first preference over distribution of the assets on liquidation. A simple 1x-1.5x return is typically sought. Even where the business is up and running, an investor\'s ultimate objective is exit via an IPO or strategic sale. If an exit by these means is not possible, investor agreements typically require the startup to buy back the shares from the investor at a price that delivers a guaranteed internal rate of return to the investors. All exit clauses need to be vetted carefully. \n'

S'Faridabad (Haryana): A court here on Monday sent four people, arrested for allegedly threatening a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student with rape near Bhardwaj Lake, to 14 days\' judicial custody. The four accused -- Sachin (20), Deepak (30), Pramod (35) and Harish (40) -- were produced before duty magistrate Manoj Rana at the Faridabad Civil Court. The woman also recorded her statement before the duty magistrate. A \'test identification parade\' of the accused will be held on Wednesday.\nRepresentational Image\nIn her complaint filed at the Vasant Kunj (North) police station in Delhi, the woman alleged that she was threatened with rape and six of her friends were roughed up by a group of locals near Bhardwaj Lake in Asola on August 14 evening. The woman said that she lodged her complaint at Vasant Kunj (North) police station in Delhi after the Haryana Police refused to take cognisance of her complaint.\n She also alleged that Haryana Police officials questioned her character and made her write an apology letter. Later, a sub-inspector of Haryana Police was suspended for allegedly failing to take note of her complaint. "During investigation, we have found that the four people were involved in the case. They are residents of Faridabad village and were arrested from their hideouts on Saturday," Astha Modi, Deputy Commissioner of Faridabad (NIT), told PTI.\n The police officer said they had applied for the \'test identification parade\' of the arrested accused by the woman and her friends. It would be conducted on Wednesday, she added. In her complaint, the woman said she had gone to Surajkund with six of her friends. While she was on a motorcycle with two of her friends, an inebriated man asked them to stop, she said in her complaint.\n The man questioned them as to why they were roaming in the area till late in the night and raised aspersions on her character, the police said. The police added that the man then allegedly called his father and brother, and assaulted the woman and her friends. They also took her to a shed nearby where they threatened her with rape. In the meantime, the woman\'s other friends arrived there and rescued her and her two friends, the police said.\n On the basis of her complaint, a zero FIR was registered at the Vasant Kunj (North) police station and the case was transferred to Surajkund police station in Haryana. A zero FIR is generally a complaint lodged with the police by the victim of a cognisable offence or by someone on his or her behalf. \n'

S'Electron density distribution of the frontier orbital of a TMTTF molecule. Electrons of the constituent atoms of the molecule can be considered as either core electrons, which have no interactions with the surroundings, or electrons of frontier orbitals, which determine many physical properties of the molecule. We succeeded in visualizing the frontier molecular orbital distribution of a TMTTF by precise structural analysis using a core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. Credit: Shunsuke Kitou\nNagoya University-led team of physicists use a synchrotron radiation X-ray source to probe a so-called "structure-less" transition and develop a new understanding of molecular conductors. \nWe normally associate conduction of electricity with metals. However, some of the high measured conductivities are found in certain organic molecular crystals. Metallic, semiconducting and even superconducting properties can be achieved in these materials, which have interested scientists for decades. Changing temperature or pressure causes phase transitions in the crystal structure of molecular conductors and their related conduction properties. Scientists can usually determine the crystal structure using X-ray diffraction. However, structural change accompanying phase transition in a particular organic crystal (TMTTF)2PF6 has defied examination for almost 40 years.\nNow, a research team at Nagoya University has finally explained the mysterious structural changes of this phase transition and its related electronic behavior.\n"Researchers have questioned that the TMTTF (tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene) salt shows a charge disproportionation transition at 67 Kelvin but no relevant changes in its crystal structure. This transition is a long-standing mystery known as a \'structure-less transition\'," explains lead author Shunsuke Kitou.\nTMTTF is an organic donor that is also found in some organic superconductors. Just above the temperature that liquid nitrogen freezes, this organic crystal behaves as an insulator. But as the temperature is lowered it goes through electronic and magnetic changes.\nUntil now these structural changes were too small to measure directly. Using the X-ray source at SPring8, in Hyogo Japan, the team could precisely determine the crystal structure at each stage. The structure-less transition involves the formation of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal, based on a change in the distribution pattern of electrons in the structure.\n"We have precisely characterized the subtle structural changes across this transition and finally provided a complete physical explanation for the apparent unchanging structure of this organic conductor," says group leader Hiroshi Sawa. "Accurate crystallographic data is still lacking for many organic conductors and we hope our findings will inspire other groups to look more closely at these systems. A better understanding of their complex behavior could pave the way to a range of new functional electronic materials." \nMore information: Shunsuke Kitou et al.

S"IANS\nParis, Aug 21: Neymar seemed to be everywhere as he rejuvenated French football club Paris Saint Germain in its come-from-behind 6-2 victory over Toulouse, his second match for the squad, this time at the Parc des Princes here.\nOn Sunday, the home squad scored four times in the last 15 minutes of play, and Neymar, apart from scoring twice, participated in two of his team's other goals and provided two assists, reports Efe.\nThe Brazilian had scored on his debut outing in PSG's 3-0 win at Guingamp last week, after joining the squad from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros ($262 million)\nThe Brazilian superstar clearly showed his emotions before the opening of the match as the stadium observed a moment of silence for the 14 people killed in the terror attacks in and near Barcelona last week.\nBut it was the visitors who got on the board first with a tally in the 18th minute by Max Gradel.\nThen it was Neymar's turn just after the half-hour point taking advantage of a shot by Adrien Rabiot to score.\nFour minutes later, Rabiot once again combined with Neymar and the Frenchman scored from 18 meters, beating out Alban Lafont for Toulouse, and after that point PSG settled down substantially but never lost control of the match.\nTwenty minutes before the final whistle, after Italian Marco Verratti was red-carded, PSG was left with just 10 men on the pitch, although that didn't seem to affect them at all\nThen - after Neymar was fouled - Uruguayan Edinson Cavani fired a penalty kick in from 11 meters, making it 3-1.\nChristopher Jullien took advantage of a misplay to score again for Toulouse a few minutes later, knocking in a header for 3-2.\nNeymar helped get the ball to Javier Pastore, who smashed one into the twine in the 82nd minute, only to be superseded by a fabulous goal by Layvin Kurzawa, helped by the Brazilian once again.\nThen, it was Neymar who put the icing on the cake in extra time with a great solo finish for the final result as PSG stayed undefeated.\n"

S'NEW DELHI: The financial stress on the telecom sector can be reduced to a great extent by considering a reduction in spectrum usage charges as well as license fees, according to an ASSOCHAM-KPMG joint study.\nThe high reserve price of spectrum may need to be revisited in light of the financial stress which industry faces in the current scenario. The government may consider uniformity in import duties on Lithium-ion batteries across industries to facilitate affordability of green sites. All associated benefits as part of infrastructure status may be extended to telecom infrastructure companies, reveals the ASSOCHAM-KPMG joint study.\nThe central government can consider coming up with guidelines to ensure property tax is levied at uniform rates and is consistent across various state and regional authorities. Authorities may consider extending GST benefits to IP-1s (IP-1 Infrastructure Provider) for procurement of telecom towers as well as subsidisation of diesel cost since it forms a part of operational costs for infrastructure providers.\nThe government may explore the possibility of lowering duty on imports of critical equipment and also evaluate lessening the restrictions imposed on the import of second hand equipment.\nTill the time the basic customs duty (BCD) is removed, BCD exemption should be given to OEMs for supply to DTA, which manufacture in SEZ based in India to help keep capex in check.\nSkill development programmes may be created with a focus on creating skilled manpower as well as re-skilling of existing manpower in order to be ready for emerging technologies. As per the Indian Telegraph Right of Way rules, IP-1s have not been included under the purview of the same. Inclusion of IP-1s under the same will help increase efficiencies in laying down infrastructure across the country. There is a need for defining a security framework around telecom infrastructure allowing it to be treated as essential infrastructure and stringent penal provisions need to be in place to mitigate risk of damage to these assets.\nThe industry is of the view that the government may increase the MEIS incentive and introduce new incentives to attract more players in the market and to encourage the existing players to ramp up manufacturing Implementation targets of e-waste collection need to be reviewed, as against the current requirement, to ensure compliance across the industry. ASSOCHAM recommends reconsideration of TEC testing of telecom equipment in favor of an SDoC (Supplier Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) regime.\nThe government may consider making E and V bands available in order to provide better last mile connectivity to subscribers. In order to reduce the burden on infrastructure providers, industry recommend classification of common telecom/ digital infrastructure under a common umbrella and be allowed to be shared amongst licensed TSPs under existing registration certificates.\nApproval process for handsets should be streamlined to ensure competitive advantage does not get lost for handset manufacturers while launching new products. The Preferential Market Access (PMA) policy may be revised to ensure level playing field for local and global telecom equipment manufacturers.\nUniform and seamless implementation of Right of Way Rules 2016, across central, state governments and local municipal bodies will help ease deployment of overground and underground infrastructure and provide a level-playing field for telecom infrastructure provisioning. These recommendations, if considered for implementation would help industry in coping with the financial burden currently faced, helping improve business performance as well as prepare for the next wave of growth in terms of new technologies such as IoT, M2M, 5G etc. and continue in the path of connecting the country and helping the government achieve the digital dream and inclusive development.\n'

S"NEYMAR made it three goals from two games for new club Paris St Germain as they came from behind to beat Toulouse 6-2 at the Parc des Princes to go top of Ligue 1.\nNeymar's freakish footwork1:16\nThe Brazilian forward opened his account in last week\xe2\x80\x99s win at Guingamp and followed it up with a double following his world record STG200 million arrival from Barcelona.\nBut it was Max Gradel who threatened to steal the headlines when he gave the visitors a surprise lead.\nAfter equalising in the 31st minute, Neymar set up Adrien Rabiot to score four minutes later to send his team into the interval in front.\nMarco Verratti was sent off midway through the second half but the hosts lost none of their momentum and Edinson Cavani emphatically dispatched a penalty - won by Neymar - to give PSG some daylight.\nParis Saint-Germain's Brazilian forward Neymar smiles Source: AFP\nHowever, Toulouse refused to go down without a fight and Christopher Jullien reduced the deficit after 78 minutes with a header that deflected into the net off Thiago Silva.\nSubstitute Javier Pastore quickly restored the two-goal cushion with a lovely curling effort from just outside the box before Layvin Kurzawa extended the lead in the 84th minute with a superb volley from a driven cross by Neymar, who completed the scoring in time added on.\nMeanwhile Caen registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory at Lille.\nPSG's Neymar, right, and PSG's Layvin Kurzawa Source: AP\nThe Normandy club had begun the campaign with back-to-back 1-0 defeats but Damien Da Silva\xe2\x80\x99s early header and a strike by Ivan Santini midway through the second half saw them get off the mark at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

S'It is that time of year when waves of Madras nostalgia descend on us as we prepare to celebrate the city\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. Beginning with the advent of the East India Company to these shores may give us a shorter history of the city, but it carries certain convenience as the era is, perhaps, better recorded. The \xe2\x80\x9cpattinam\xe2\x80\x99 itself goes back a long way, but for most part today\xe2\x80\x99s metropolis would have been a sleepy cluster of fishing villages. Even the city\xe2\x80\x99s artificial harbour is much younger and had nought to do with the early seafaring conquests of the Cholas who ruled way further south.\nThe more important place in the region in early history was Kancheepuram which was ruled by a representative of the Chola family, then taken over by the Satavahanas from Andhra and then went to the Pallavas before being ruled once again by the Cholas in their ninth and 10th century heyday. The Pallavas gave the region close to the city its most famous temples on the beach, of which just one remains.\nThe Tiruvarur chariot sculpture at Valluvar Kottam.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s always a gripping trip into history to go to Mahabalipuram once in a few years to marvel at the architecture of the temple and the rock carvings. You get a real feel of what the place would have been like before the fishing villages with a few famous temples built more than 1,000 years ago started metamorphosing into its modern avatar of Chennai. The rock carvings are very intricate and indicative of a mastery of working with big stone, a hallmark of much of the ancient temple architecture of the region.\nThe Valluvar Kottam harks back at the era gone by, its temple chariot shape rising to nearly 40 metres and modelled on the Thiruvarur temple \xe2\x80\x98ther\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few reminders of a time when a city older than its British period is recalled. The Grand Chola hotel on Mount Road of today manages to recapture the sheer elegance of stone work in its exteriors as its architects sought and found a niche that combines nostalgia with the modern. Much of the rest of the city architecture on a large scale sticks to the Indo-saracenic style made popular by Chisholm and Irwin and carries the distinct stamp of Madras.\nIt is commonly believed that the agreement to buy a sliver of land or sand where the Fort St George stands was transacted by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan, through the good offices of the \xe2\x80\x98dubash\xe2\x80\x99, Beri Thimmappa, with the local Nayak rulers on August 22, 1639. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have been able to pinpoint a particular day on which a city could have been said to have been founded. The city\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the more modern era was marked by the arrival of the British, which makes Madras-Chennaiunique as the first foreign influence came much later than in the north where the Mughals had ruled.\nYou could cut a cake on Tuesday for Madras / Chennai firm in the knowledge that the day had a lot to do with changing history although we have far less reason to venerate the British rulers of the city, particularly the likes of Lord Robert Clive who pillaged like a man possessed. The hair-raising tale of a single man\xe2\x80\x99s plunder probably finds an echo only in the most modern era in which a couple of Dravidian parties were said to have revived the Clive touch of \xe2\x80\x98take and take\xe2\x80\x99 and for 50 years we have been in this particular era of ruler wealth at the expense of the people.\nThe 1960s were a different era in which the city was very much old Madras. The trams ran through the main arterial roads and were a fun ride at stately speed, a trip from the Royapettah tram shed to Central Station and back being the highlight of early forays into the delights of discovering a city. Barges carrying timber would float on the Buckingham Canal with the \xe2\x80\x98gondoliers\xe2\x80\x99 of Madras using very long bargepoles to do the steering.\nRowers passing the outrigger test and going on to the Adyar river in sculls would be dunked in the water in celebration after their maiden row. The \xe2\x80\x98dunking ceremony\xe2\x80\x99 would be considered injurious to health these days considering how grossly polluted the water is. The sands of the Marina were pristine, the popular \xe2\x80\x98kuchi\xe2\x80\x99 ice sellers standing on the periphery or on the footpaths around the Gandhi statue. The breeze could be your companion all the way on the walk back home because the city wasn\xe2\x80\x99t built up like it is now.\nNo amount of nostalgia is going to bring back the \xe2\x80\x9cThose were the days, my friend\xe2\x80\x9d kind of imagery about the city that hosted our childhood. But modern Chennai has its delights to offer too, as well as the connectivity of a modern city, although it seems to be taking an enormous time to get the Metro going over a greater part of the city. When will a passenger getting off the train at Central ever take a ride to the Airport on the Metro hassle-free as we would from Heathrow to Central London?\n'

S"Looks, Today's Makeup\nby Rati\nHi Everyone, \xf0\x9f\x99\x82\n I did this makeup look on the first day when we reached Croatia. My skin was a bit tired honestly with all the flight travelling.

S'Since the beginning of time, sun has been available, and it will always be there. Because of the climbing cost of energy, the use of alternative energy has gone up. Solar energy is a great option for numerous nations that get lots of sunshine. As a result of the constant improvements in technology and cost, more and more homes are using solar energy. Your home can generate quite a bit of electricity even if you merely have severl solar arrays and a small amount of sunlight.\n solar power system \nOne problem is that many homes are not constructed to take full advantage of sunshine. Luckily, many of the new systems can produce more electrical energy with less sun. The contemporary solar panel system are set up at a more steeper angle so houses that are not positioned to obtain a lot of sunlight can still produce energy. Numerous systems nowadays use a rail system which allows the solar panels to be placed for optimal exposure. In addition, it is set up for expansion later if necessary.\nIf you want to set up a solar panel, you will need to review your current electricity requirements. Once you know how much power you use, you will be able to determine what size you need to have. Depending on your abilities and resources, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to start small, and make room to expand at a later time. Once ready, you can expect to see a reduction by as much as 80% in your power bill within 12 months. With just a basic solar panel system, you can work on the outdoor lighting, and later on increase your system, and move up to the interior electricity.\nThe most important element in your solar power system is the inverter. You must ensure that you have the correct size since the inverter will convert DC to AC. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right size, the solar power system won\xe2\x80\x99t be effective. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to have a big inverter at the beginning so that expansion will be less problematic. Try not to install the inverter yourself, but hire a licensed electrician to install this for you. The riskiest part of installing it is properly connecting your solar energy system to your electrical system. Stay away from electricity, unless you are a professional electrician.\nIf you are looking for a reason to get a solar energy system, the state and federal governments are giving homeowners incentives to install their own system. You can have your own environmentally friendly energy system without spending much of your own money. This is a fantastic beginning to trying to live a green lifestyle.\n'

S' BENGALURU: On an average, hundreds of missing, abandoned, trafficked, runaway and at-risk children are rescued from Bengaluru every month, but these numbers tend to see an increase in June, July and August. According to experts, the disinterest in going back to school after the summer break acts as a catalyst for many children from poor families to leave their homes. \n  Volunteers involved in rescue and rehabilitation of missing children said ill-adjustment at school, coupled with the desire to run away and earn, promps them to come to Bengaluru from across the country . \n According to Bangalore Oniyavara Seva Coota (Bosco), an NGO working with the `young at risk\' since 1980 as well as the nodal agency for administering the missing children programme in the state, the number of children rescued in the past three months increased from 496 in May to 556 in June and 711 in July. On August 1, 42 kids were rescued. \n Shaik Md Shafi, coordinator of Bosco Yuvodaya, said the missing, runaway and at-risk children are increasingly heading to Bengaluru for survival and better prospects. "The way Mumbai used to be the hub of those seeking better fortune, Bengaluru is now becoming the destination for children of all backgrounds from across the country . Apart from kids within the state, we rescue the maximum number of children from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. A good number of them illegally work at bag-making and garment factories," he said. \n Fr Edward Thomas, nodal director of the Missing Children Bureau (MCB), said poor education standards in rural areas as well as an alluring city play a big role in drawing children to Bengaluru. "Most of them come here hoping to earn money, the way many of their relatives would have. They run away because of the inability to cope with academics.Sadly , there are brokers stationed at these transit points who eye such minors, travelling alone or unaccompanied, and lure them with job offers," he said. Pointing out that there\'s a change in the trend, he said children would become ragpickers and hang around bus and railway stations earlier. "Now, they are more likely to be employed as child labourers or pressed into begging rackets," he added. \n Fr Mathew Thomas, executive director of Bosco, said: "Of the multiple factors, the increase in these months is due to academic disinterest or fear of going back to school.Peers play a big role in this by influencing other kids to run away from school and head to the city." \n'

S'TransStadia\'s "The Arena" is paving the future for India\'s budding sports sector\nNo, really, that\'s a football stadium\n"How do we allow one of the biggest tournaments we\'ve organised in this country to be held in a place that is even ready, yet?"\nWhen Star Sports\' head honchos were given the VIP tour in early 2016 of a still under construction stadium complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, they must surely have thought there was no way they\'d let the inaugural [PKL-style] Kabaddi World Cup - an event for which they\'d gained the right to organise, not just broadcast - be hosted in a venue that wasn\'t even ready yet.\nThen Udit Sheth started speaking.\nBy the end of his tour, the MD of SE TranStadia had breathed life into the 60,000 Tonnes of Cement and 12,000 Tonnes of steel that were being poured into the earth smack-bang in the middle of the bustling city of Ahmedabad and what he had christened "The Arena" stood tall in front of the visitors.\nThe Star Sports people were convinced. Just as the then CM of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, had been back in 2009.\nIt was then that Sheth and his father, the head of Setco Automobiles (one of the largest manufacturers of automotive clutches) and Lavacast (a fully automated cast-iron foundry) signed a MoU to take over the defunct Abad Dairy from the State Government and transform it into a stadium. Not just any stadium, but one that can be addressed by one of our governments\', and the private enterprises\' (that build these mammoth projects), favourite terms - "world-class". \nThe interiors live up to the swanky exterior\nThe Sheths sold him the fantasy of having a genuinely A-grade, "state-of-the-art" (another of one those favourite state-sponsored catchphrases) sports stadium that would be a far cry from the dilapidated, decaying hunks of cement and steel that pass for stadiums today in the nation, and the big man was convinced. \nWhat now stands tall and proud on the shores of the historic Kankaria lake is that fantasy come to life; a PPP project built in the best traditions of the business model that has put India on the development fast track. \nWhen we quizzed him about how he was successfully able to rope in Star Sports he gave a self-effacing shrug and said "we had dinner with them, and we talked to them about the advantages we could offer them" - simple words spoken with the simple, all-powerful, conviction of a man who knows his future is in his own hands.\nThe advantages he spoke of were rather unique - The Area is one of the few stadiums in India that allows broadcasters to simply "plug and play"... there\'s no need for miles of wires to be dragged from one corner to the other or a manhunt to look for the nearest connection point, everything has been setup in the Stadium\'s broadcast boxes and the TV crews need merely turn up. Add to this two of TransStadia\'s patented technologies, T-box (a modular, retractable, seating system that allows a 5000 seater arena to be set up in less than a day) and StadiArena (a roll-down door that allows an open arena to be converted into a completely indoor one at the press of a button - this can be done in under six minutes as we witnessed ourselves) and you\'ve got a Kabaddi World Cup standard indoor arena set up across 34,444 odd sq.ft. of pillarless space. \nThe Arena played host to India\'s triumph in the 2016 Kabaddi WC\nAugmenting the physical infrastructure is a sports science center the likes of which the nation\'s athletes have been craving for. Covering a range of tests that accurately measure an athlete\'s inherent attributes and abilities while stretching them to their very limits, the doctors/scientists at this centre are fully confident that they\'ll be able to bring out the very best in anyone who passes through their facility. \nIn fact, for the World Cup, they ran these tests on the participating athletes and came up with some pretty cool results - predicting all 4 semi-finalists and having an 85% success rate on their predictions of who\'ll perform well. \nThey\'ve already tested this out on Railways sports personnel and are currently in the process of rolling out a comprehensive plan for the elite of the elite that are enrolled with the Sports Authority of India. \nThe sports science section covers recovery & rehab, nutrition planning, noninvasive treatment of sports injuries, assessments and interventions. (The best thing? They plan to make these facilities open to the general public soon!) The sports science section covers recovery & rehab, nutrition planning, noninvasive treatment of sports injuries, assessments and interventions. (The best thing? They plan to make these facilities open to the general public soon!)\nBut it\'s not just the already-got-to-the-top elite that the Arena wants to address... they will be running a program that allows schoolchildren across various age groups to pass through this facility and are putting the finishing touches on a schedule that will allow for this to happen smoothly around-the-year. A mobile van outfitted with the testing equipment is already touring the state - the facility is built on the same premise that has driven China to Olympic glory in the past decade; catch them young, identify the unique attributes of the children and channel them into a sport where those attributes will be maximised - after all, this was all intended as a grassroots programme when it all started out. \nMore details on this fascinating aspect of the Stadium - as well as the various Academies they intend to start with this scientific methodology being its foundations - will be covered by my colleague Shaurya \nPride of place, though, was occupied by a 20,000 seater football stadium that\'s got a pristine green pitch (carefully made of the finest Bermuda grass, we\'re told) that\'s protected by another one of their patented technologies - the Turf Protector; an interesting piece of technology that enables them to hold any function they want - dandiya nights included - on the pitch, without it damaging the pitch (Here\'s the company\'s pitch for the protector: [it is the] world\xe2\x80\x99s only turf protection system manufactured from truly translucent HDPE material, it allows for continuous photosynthesis, which ensures optimal turf health, together with a 30-year UV degradation guarantee).\n When Prime Minister Modi came a-visiting to inaugurate the facility, it hosted the massive crowd that came to see him without much of a fuss - with the majority of them stood, or seated, on the football pitch, the Turf Protector ensured not a blade of grass was harmed. Some tech, that. \nPM Modi waves as he addresses the crowd gathered on the football pitch, and on the stadium seats\nThe FIFA-approved pitch was put in place too late for it to be in contention for the FIFA U-17 World Cup, if Praful Patel and the AIFF do win their reported bid for the U-20 bonanza, you can be sure the Ahmedabad Arena will be one of the stadia that play host to one of FIFA\'s biggest events. \nAs we continued the tour of the facility one thing was becoming glaringly apparent - sure it was the keen interest of sport that Sheth has that drove the project on, but it\'s the canny businessman within him that gave us the feeling that this venture success - apart from the sports facilities, there\'s a high-end club called EKA that has already attracted over 1,000 memberships from across Ahmedabad. The club offers access to facilities that can host 14 sports (futsal, volleyball, basketball, badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis, et al) and a rooftop infinity pool that overlooks the football stadium.\nThe best seat in the house just got a new definition\nHe\'s also got a range of high-end retail outlets lined up to occupy the earmarked commercial space - space that benefits from reduced FAR restrictions that the Arena has - Sheth envisages it as a destination unto itself that will continue to keep the cash registers ringing whether or not there\'s a major sporting occasion on the horizon. It\'s the lack of such solid business-sense that has led to many-a-promising venture meeting its end prematurely but there\'s no such lack of vision behind this. \nLocated smack bang in the middle of the city, The Arena is an imposing sight.\nThis is just the beginning... what Sheth and Modi envisaged in the beginning, and what they are working towards, is a 7-stadia network that works with the Ahmedabad Arena as the hub and the others as it\'s spokes (picture a wheel, with Ahmedabad in the centre and the other cities being connected to by spokes) allowing the reach of the facility to expand towards the very hinterlands of the state it operates in. \nThis is a model, Sheth assures us, that can be replicated across the nation and with the kind of environment that TransStadia are looking to promote across the nation, the only way for Indian sports is up.\nAfter all, if the dilapidated remains of an abandoned dairy can be turned into one of the most ultra-modern sports facilities on the planet, the sky is the very limit. \n'

Bengali actor Prosenjit had that honour on Monday morning - what a way to begin the week - when Mr Bachchan tweeted a link to the trailer of Prosenjit\'s new film Yeti Obhijaan. "Prosenjit, superstar from Bengal. Interesting film. Watch," tweeted Amitabh Bachchan, 74. "Thanks a lot, sir. Lots of respect," responded Prosenjit, who co-starred with the senior star\'s daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in acclaimed 2003 film Chokher Bali.

Directed by Srijit Mukherjee - known to Bollywood audiences for making Begum Jaan recently - the film is the second in a series based on the character of Kakababu from Bengali novels by author Sunil Gangopadhyay. Prosenjit is cast against type in the distinctly unglamorous role of Kakababu, an intrepid senior citizen much in demand as a solver of impossible crimes.\nYeti Obhijaan, partly filmed in Switzerland, also stars Jisshu Sengupta and will release on September 22.\n Prosenjit, son of actor Biswajit, has an extensive list of film credits. After a predominantly mainstream career through the 80s and 90s, the 54-year-old actor was cast in acclaimed films such as Chokher Bali and, subsequently, Shob Choritro Kalponik, Noukadubi and Autograph. He played Anthony Firinghee in Srijit Mukherjee\'s 2014 film Jaatishwar. He has also appeared in a handful of Hindi films, including the Dibakar Banerjee-made Shanghai.\n'

S'Top hotel managers shared their secret hacks for scoring free room upgrades so your next trip can be even better than you ever imagined.\nLet the staff know it\'s your special day\n  "My best recommendation is to travel on your anniversary and mention it when you book your reservation," shares Nils Stolzlechner, the general manager of the  Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Puerto Rico Golf & Beach Resort . He says that if there are suitable upgrade rooms available, hotel staff will go above and beyond to make your stay special, and may offer you other amenities. See? It pays to celebrate your romance. Besides traveling, here are other  anniversary traditions of happy couples .  \nBe loyal\n  This is especially important for business travelers who may end up visiting the same cities over and over again: If you find a hotel that suits your needs and you enjoy your stay, keep booking the same place and get to know the staff. "If you are a return guest it\'s common for the hotel to upgrade you. If there was a hotel room you had on a prior visit that you liked, just ask\xe2\x80\x94hotels do like to recognize their repeat guests," explains Nils. This is also one of the many  ways travel agents suggest how to travel cheap .  \nTravel on your birthday\n  Birthdays are extra special, and nice hotels are just itching for a way to make guests feel warm and fuzzy. "We love celebrating and recognizing special days, so make sure to let us know if there is a member of your party that is celebrating a birthday," tells Nils. Usually a better room, a more scenic view, or extra amenities are added to your stay without adding to your bill. Here are some  special hotels for your special day .  \nOn your honeymoon? Let everyone know it\n  "We know it is a special occasion, so we want it to be the most memorable vacation. Always inform hotel staff at time of reservation to increase your chances on upgrades and possible amenities," says Nils. This is something he personally does time and time again at his property, a popular honeymoon spot. Find out the  most romantic small towns for honeymoons .  \nIf you\'re up to it, travel while you\'re pregnant\n  If your doctor says it\'s OK and you\'re feeling pretty good, hop on board the babymoon trend and take a vacation. Make sure you mosey on up to the check-in desk with your belly proudly pronounced, because telling hotel staff about your babymoon is one way to get a great free hotel upgrade. "This one is quite a new trend and many don\'t use it, but for the hotels that do know about babymoons, they know you want to relax and feel special, so make sure you let them know." Nils also suggests this tip will work if it\'s your first romantic trip away from the kids, because hotels like to help you rekindle your romance, too. Here are the  10 best babymoon destinations .  \nJoin the hotel\'s rewards program\n  "Membership programs usually allow for the guest to use their points for upgrades," shares Nils. "The beauty of it is that you are still earning points for staying at the hotel in an upgraded room." This hack is particularly useful for people who don\'t stay frequently, develop relationships with staff, or have a life milestone to celebrate.  \nCall the hotel directly to book\n  "Call the hotel to make your reservation rather than email or book online," hares Richard Bussiere, Managing Director at  Langham Place, New York . "This gives you the opportunity to interact with another person and share some details about the reason for your stay. We unearth little nuggets of information that wouldn\'t organically come up in the course of an email exchange." Perhaps it is your first trip to New York, or you are celebrating the fact that a family member recently recovered from an illness...when the reservation agents finds these things out, they form a personal connection with the guest and that inspires them to surprise and delight that guest to an even greater degree, which can sometimes mean an upgrade." Aside from the personal connections, hotel booking sites often take hefty fees that cut into the hotel\'s bottom line. If the hotel isn\'t paying as much as ten or twenty percent to a booking site, they have more room to throw you a free upgrade, dinner, or add some special touches to your room.  \nBook last minute\n  "Last minute is your best shot," tells Jade McBride, hospitality manager at  Vermejo Park Ranch  in New Mexico. "If I have the chance to sell a room at a higher rate, I can\'t offer the upgrade." Last minute is best for both parties, she says, and it makes sense. Waste not, want not, right? Especially because  science says vacation is actually good for you .  \nBring some goodies from home or the airport\n  "Staff love gratuity, and we love it when a guest genuinely shows appreciation, but no one likes to feel like they are being bribed," says McBride. Try bringing some little gifts from duty-free like chocolates or packaged snacks from a far off land to help pave the way to a room upgrade request.  \nWhen all else fails, just ask\n "Most managers are looking for ways to impress their guests and the last thing we want to do is say \'no\' to a guest," McBride explains. "If I have the room, I love doing something to make a guest\'s stay with us great." \nLet the staff know it\'s your special day\n  Jacky Co/Shutterstock "My best recommendation is to travel on your anniversary and mention it when you book your reservation," shares Nils Stolzlechner, the general manager of the  Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Puerto Rico Golf & Beach Resort .

S"Your complete guide to BMW's ultimate super-saloon. Pick a favourite\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes developed a monster street version of the 190 named the 2.3 16V, sending the spoiler-clad Benz onto the roads in 1983. BMW had nothing to respond with.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNot our words, but the words of BMW itself; specifically, BMW\xe2\x80\x99s M Division. It\xe2\x80\x99s not often you find such explicit praise from rival performance powerhouses, but then it\xe2\x80\x99s not often BMW finds itself without a proposition that has now become ingrained into its very DNA: a really fast, really powerful street-legal performance saloon. You see, M Power opined that \xe2\x80\x9cmotor racing with near-series cars was becoming increasingly popular\xe2\x80\x9d, and at the time of the 190\xe2\x80\x99s reign (in the early 1980s, the Mercedes Benz 190E 2.3 16V was indeed a monster Benz - in the hands of Ayrton Senna at the N\xc3\xbcrburgring in a one-make, one-off race filled with track-spec 190s to inaugurate the new circuit, he decimated all), BMW had nothing to offer enthusiasts who wanted a sportier version of its 5 Series.\nSo it went to work on a fast 5er (and later of course, a faster 3 Series, that would be a more direct rival to that 190). The very first M-powered 5 Series - technically named the M535i - arrived in 1984. To the rest of us, it was the first M5, born more than 30 years ago.\nIt had a 3.5-litre straight six developing 218bhp and 229lb ft of torque. It accelerated from 0-62mph in 7.2 seconds. It had a top speed of 143mph. It had specially developed Michelins, a redesigned front spoiler and rear boot lip spoiler.\nBut the M535i was just the start. No sooner was it out the door, the M-Division engineers set to work making it faster, nastier and more sideways. The most recent \xe2\x80\x9830 Jahre\xe2\x80\x99 edition M5 for example - which Chris Harris pitted against the Lexus GS F - features a twin-turbo V8 with nearly 600bhp, for goodness sake. One iteration even features a V10. The new one gets four-wheel-drive and a 0-62mph time of just 3.4s. It\xe2\x80\x99ll still drift, mind\xe2\x80\xa6\nRead on to see how the M5 has grown up over the years\xe2\x80\xa6\n"

S'(Bloomberg) -- Investors are giving up on Lenovo Group Ltd., the Chinese firm that muscled its way on to the global technology stage through purchases of IBM\xe2\x80\x99s PC division and the Motorola smartphone business.\nWhile online game maker Tencent Holdings Ltd. racks up the record highs, leading Hong Kong stocks to regional domination, Lenovo shares are plummeting. Unlike Tencent -- whose earnings again surprised to the top side last week -- Beijing-based Lenovo posted an unexpected quarterly loss Friday, sending the stock to a six-year low on Monday. The firm\xe2\x80\x99s debt got hit as well, with the spread on 2022 notes ballooning to the widest in over a month. \nThe computer maker\xe2\x80\x99s shares have slumped 68 percent from a high reached in 2015, a rout that puts it alongside mainland Chinese stocks that collapsed when an equity bubble burst two years ago. The disconnect between the company\xe2\x80\x99s shares and the global tech stock boom just makes it all the more depressing for Lenovo investors.\n'

S'Range anxiety? What range anxiety?\nIn case you haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed, electric cars \xe2\x80\x93 most prominently Tesla \xe2\x80\x93 have been gaining popular momentum at a rate that has to terrify anyone with a stake in BP, Shell or Esso. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s due to emissions scandals, populist government policies or a pendulum-like swing in public opinion, the electric car is, all of a sudden, looking like the golden child of our driving future. \nEven one of the biggest reservations that consumers have about electric cars \xe2\x80\x93 range anxiety \xe2\x80\x93 has quietly subsided in the face of ever-increasing battery power density. As you may already know, the standard Tesla Model S 100D, on 19-inch wheels, has an official range of about 300 miles at 70mph, with the aircon running. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot. \nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not as far as a group of Italian masochists have managed to wring from a very mildly modified Model S \xe2\x80\x93 669.8 miles, or 1078km. Yep. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more than you\xe2\x80\x99d expect. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a chuffing long way away from where you started. \nThe basic car in question is the Model S 100D, which is fitted with the largest battery pack available from Tesla, as well as one motor on each axle. But instead of the P100D\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98high-performance\xe2\x80\x99 motor, the 100D makes do with a less powerful \xe2\x80\x93 and less energy-intensive \xe2\x80\x93 motor. So it\xe2\x80\x99s as much juice as possible, without using the wilfully psychotic powertrain. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still only capable of 300-odd miles \xe2\x80\x93 at least, officially. \nSo, you might be wondering, what did these intrepid Italians do to ensure their Tesla could do nearly 670 miles on a single charge? Well, not that much, as it turns out. But that certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it was a pleasant trip.\nFor starters, they exchanged the rather grippy standard tyres for a set with low rolling resistance \xe2\x80\x93 i.e., less grip \xe2\x80\x93 and then set off at a blistering 25mph cruise. Yep, the average speed over their 27-hour journey was about the rate at which Queen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s Rolls-Royce swans up the Mall on the way to Westminster. And they did it, in August, with the aircon off and the windows up.\nNow, some (kind of) science \xe2\x80\x93 the batteries in the Tesla work best at temperatures between 30\xc2\xbaC and 40\xc2\xbaC, which works in the Italians\xe2\x80\x99 favour. Low rolling resistance tyres and switching the aircon off tilt the balance further. And driving at a speed that would enrage anyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t in a Skoda Fabia is enough to tip the 100D over the 1000km mark.\nAlso, you may have noticed that we keep saying \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d, not \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x9d. There were, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not making this up, five Italians sharing one un-airconditioned cabin for 27 hours, in roughly the middle of the Italian summer. Hey \xe2\x80\x93 world records were never meant to be easy. Also, credit where it\xe2\x80\x99s due for a 670-mile run while carrying the weight penalty of five passengers. \nWhy so many people? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as sharing the driving duties for perhaps the most painfully slow Italian car journey since the last time we tried to drive the Amalfi Coast in peak tourist season. \nMr Musk (also known as the last, best hope for humanity) sent his congratulations to the Tesla Owners Italia team via Twitter, noting their official record as the first to take a production electric car more than 1000km (620 miles) on a single charge. \nPerhaps, when we all have electric saloons capable of 700 miles at 70mph with the aircon pumping and the stereo blasting, this\xe2\x80\x99ll seem like a less worthy achievement. For now, though, let\xe2\x80\x99s salute anyone willing to put in this amount of effort to allay our range anxiety. \nPhotos: Tesla Owners Italia\n'

S'Split squat is a squat variation that will not put any stress on your back. \nSquats are one of the most functional exercises but because it incorporates multiple muscles and joints and any faulty technique can cause back pain. The joints of the spine are most vulnerable to injury while squatting. You must ideally keep your spinal column rigid throughout the movement and avoid forward trunk flexion to prevent injury. The speed at which you perform your squats also has a direct correlation to the amount of stress it places on your joints. However, if you already suffer from lower back pain, performing this squat variation called split squat can be a much better option according to fitness expert Roshni Shah, from V\xe2\x80\x99s Fitness Studio, Mumbai.\nBenefits\n This version of squat can also be ideal for you if you are a beginner or have suffered a back injury in the past. This move works your upper legs, thighs and buttocks without putting much strain on your lower back. The split squat can be a much better way to sculpt, shape and lift those rear muscles. Also, perform these five exercises to strengthen your lower back.\nTo perform split squat,\nStand with your right foot about two feet ahead of your left foot in a staggered stance. Make sure you place your hands on your hips.\nSlowly, lower yourself down bending your right knee as much as you can. Pause for 1-2 seconds and quickly push yourself up to the starting position. That completes one repetition of the split squat. Do this 12-15 times and then repeat on the other side.\nTips\nYou need to ensure that you execute the squat slowly to reduce spinal stress.\nMake sure that you warm up for five minutes with light cardio and cool down with 2 to 3 minutes of stretching after performing the split squats.\nWeak abdominal muscles can also make you more prone to back injury and back pain. Strengthen your core by performing planks and a few of these exercises. Here are five exercises to prevent and manage back pain when bedridden.\n'

S'The Alpaca \xe2\x80\x98lifestyle\xe2\x80\x99 marketed on tv intrigued me, so my research started. Like a lifelong animal lover, the thought of getting a few of these wonderful farm animals was too tempting to pass through up. I purchased ten acres, 6 Alpacas, a large amount of fencing and gates, and the actual! The company finish hasn\xe2\x80\x99t labored out too, however, i don\xe2\x80\x99t regret providing them with whatsoever. (They\xe2\x80\x99re a pleasant tax shelter, as well as their fiber is gorgeous.) There\xe2\x80\x99s this type of peaceful feeling I receive from watching them outdoors.\nKeeping and looking after Alpacas is rather simple. I keep your boys in a single pasture and also the women in another. Each area includes a shelter to safeguard them from rain, wind, hail, and sun when needed. Their diet program includes hay, grass, and Alpaca chews produced by Purina. I additionally give alfalfa and sweet horse feed. Once every 6-8 days, they\xe2\x80\x99re dewormed with Ivermec, as well as their toes (they\xe2\x80\x99ve 2 per feet) are trimmed 3-4 occasions annually.When needed. Shearing happens annually prior to the humidity from the summer time several weeks arrives. It might appear surprizing with a that Alpacas handle the cold much better than humidity as well as heat. They\xe2\x80\x99re from South USA, however the mountain regions where it\xe2\x80\x99s cooler. Throughout the summer time several weeks, I keep outside shop-type fans and they\xe2\x80\x99ll just cush (the word for Alpacas kneeling lower) before them. Additionally, they enjoy having their underbellies and legs drenched, and mine will battle to be first in the hose!\nWithin my research, both on the internet and speaking to Alpaca proprietors, certainly one of my primary concerns was protecting my \xe2\x80\x98pacas. From predators. You will find coyotes and dogs, the stray mountain lion and bobcat, in this region. Many people suggested which I obtain a donkey to keep these intruders away and perhaps allow her to run using the Alpacas. Hence, I acquired a donkey.\nThe chickens get on better using the Alpacas compared to my hounds. As I usually have had dogs, chickens really are a new experience for this farm girl. Once more, a neighbor recommended I receive chickens to assist using the ticks and fleas which were making my hounds and me miserable. Hence, I acquired chickens. This season is my third to possess chickens and that I already have the \xe2\x80\x98new kids\xe2\x80\x99 inside a spare bed room. To date, I\xe2\x80\x99ve 4 Black Sex Links, 3 Nh Reds, and 4 Barred Plymouth Rocks. The 25 chickens in the past 24 months have really eliminated the tick problem, and in addition, they avoid the Alpacas and dogs from getting fleas. I had been concerned about the cold winters however the chickens are smarter than I figured. They lay around the fleecy backs from the Alpacas that do not appear in your thoughts (although chicken poop within their fiber is really a discomfort.) Although some say chickens are untidy, I do not find that it is a problem. They\xe2\x80\x99re great layers, and selling eggs is a fairly method of getting some gas money! Nowhere and eco-friendly eggs are \xe2\x80\x98neat\xe2\x80\x99 based on my loved ones that aren\xe2\x80\x99t accustomed to not the shop- bought variety. The down-side of getting chickens and hounds happens when the chickens enter into the dog\xe2\x80\x99s fenced-in area. Guess who wins?\nThe dogs, obviously, win world war 2. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always and can also have hounds. Before my dogs (2 King Charles Cavaliers, a save mastiff/Mastiff mix, and a pair of saving chihuahua mixes) venture out, the \xe2\x80\x98chick check\xe2\x80\x99 is performed. Or no chickens (that we thought were flightless wild birds however I was wrong) have been in the dogs\xe2\x80\x99 area. The hounds remain in!\nDutchess, my big save the girl, may be the greatest offender with regards to chickens but it is quite amusing doing react when among the Alpacas charges in her own direction. She\xe2\x80\x99s certainly place in her place. Some Alpaca proprietors recommend that you will get dogs (mostly the Great Pyrenees or Anatolian Shepherds) to protect the herd however that will not work with me. Versace thinks about hounds like a food group (not too he\xe2\x80\x99d hurt them, but he does not like dogs.)\nTypically, my critters exist together peacefully and therefore are a significant stress reliever for me personally because they all appear to behave to create me smile every single day. I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered that, as the advice of others is definitely welcome, I have to figure out what works best for me and also the Farm Animals I select to help keep. What\xe2\x80\x99s next? More variety and much more critters are certainly within my future as lengthy because they follow my two rules. Rule number 1 would be not to have a pet that may or would hurt/kill me while the second reason is not to have a pet that you will find wiped out or hurt to make money. I really like existence around the farm!\n'

S'Celebrated for pioneering shizen n\xc5\x8dh\xc5\x8d, which translates to natural farming, Fukuokais is considered to be one of the five giant personalities who inspired the organic farming movement.\nThe Better India is partnering with An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (2017), a film that documents former U.S. Vice President Al Gore\xe2\x80\x99s quest to find out how human ingenuity and passion can tackle climate change. This article is part of a 4-part series on climate change heroes.\nThe consequences of modern-day agricultural practices on the environment are devastating.\nIndustries seem to be in a mad race to grow profits and meet the demand of a growing population. From fertilisers and pesticides infiltrating groundwater to encroachment of forestland, most practices have left the environment in a precarious state for human and animal existence.\nIn fact, according to reports at least 14 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come directly from the agricultural sector, playing a significant role in the climate change.\nRealising just how grave the problem is, many agriculturists and farmers have switched to organic practices over the years, which have not only resulted in the production of chemical-free harvests, but also ensured less damage to the ecosystem.\nMasanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese farmer and philosopher who spearheaded natural farming, and began what is widely acknowledged as a revolution in the history of conventional agricultural practices.\nSource: Facebook.\nHe is considered to be one of the five giant personalities who inspired the organic farming movement along with Rudolf Steiner from Austria, Lady Eve Balfour from the United Kingdom and J.I. Rodale from the United States.\nFukuoka is celebrated for pioneering shizen n\xc5\x8dh\xc5\x8d, which translates to natural farming, where you give up conventional practices like tilling, weeding, pruning and the use of fertilisers or pesticides.\nThis ecological farming method involves a \xe2\x80\x9cdo-nothing\xe2\x80\x9d approach. The term does not refer to a lack of effort, but to the complete evasion of manufactured inputs and equipment.\nA Ramon Magsaysay award winner, Fukuoka also played an elemental role in reintroducing the ancient Japanese technique of seed bombs.\nBorn in the early 20th century to an aristocratic family in Ehime, Japan, Fukuoka started out as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology, after training as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist.\nWhile he worked as an agricultural customs inspector in Yokohama, an incident changed his life.\nAfter being hospitalised with pneumonia in 1937, \xe2\x80\x98a spiritual experience\xe2\x80\x99 during his recovery prompted the young man to look at the world differently.\nDisillusioned by Western agricultural sciences and practices, Fukuoka gave up his post as a research scientist and returned to his family\xe2\x80\x99s farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan.\nA file picture of Fukuoka at the Marina Berkeley in 1979 at San Francisco. Source: Facebook.\nHowever, his farming was interrupted with the onset of World War 2. Following the war, much of the land owned by Fukuoka\xe2\x80\x99s family was seized by U.S. troops., leaving the farmer with only three-eighths of an acre of rice land and a hillside citrus orchard.\nLike they say, setbacks only make the determined surer. Taking up natural farming once again in 1947, he managed to successfully harvest rice and barley using the no-till farming method.\nTo raise awareness and help others reap benefit from his methods of farming, Fukuoka started penning down his philosophy in the same year and wrote his first book Mu 1: The God Revolution.\nHowever, his most celebrated book, which found worldwide recognition, was The One-Straw Revolution, which was published in 1975 and later translated into English in 1978.\nTranslated into over 20 languages and selling more than one million copies, Fukuoka\xe2\x80\x99s book ended up inspiring an international movement where scores of individuals began applying his principles. It is believed that the practice of permaculture in the West found its major influence from his philosophy.\nStarting from 1979, Fukuoka started travelling across the world extensively to give lectures and worked directly in different countries to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas like deserts and barren lands.\nSource: Facebook.\nIn recognition to his extraordinary work and achievements, Fukuoka was bestowed with various awards and accolades. In 1988, Fukuoka received Visva-Bharati University\xe2\x80\x99s Desikottam Award.\nIn 1997, he was presented with the Earth Council Award at the Earth Summit+5 forum in Rio de Janeiro honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.\nOne of his famous quotes says, \nMany people think that when we practice agriculture, nature is helping us in our efforts to grow food. This is an exclusively human-centred viewpoint. We should instead, realize that we are receiving that which nature decides to give us. A farmer does not grow something in the sense that he or she creates it. That human is only a small part of the whole process by which nature expresses its being. The farmer has very little influence over that process, other than being there and doing his or her small part.\nYou can watch the trailer of the film here:\nYou can check out the film\xe2\x80\x99s global Facebook page here.\n'

S'Altogether 152 lives have been lost with 1.5 crore people affected in the ongoing West Bengal floods, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday after visiting three northern districts where large areas continued to be submerged.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, there are reports of 152 deaths due to various causes like drowning, snake bites etc in the state in the ongoing floods. 1.5 crore people have been affected,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nBanerjee said 45 lakh people have been affected in the three north Bengal districts - Malda, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur - she toured during the day. The Chief Minister went to various inundated areas, heard grievances of the affected people and instructed the administration to be prompt in relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction work. In Malda, she held a meeting with the District Magistrates, Superintendents of Police and senior officials of the three districts. Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim, state Chief Secretary, Home Secretary and Relief Department officials were present. Banerjee directed the officials to ensure there was enough stock of medicines to tackle any outbreak of diseases once the water level came down.\nThe flood situation in northern West Bengal showed an overall improvement, barring Malda district where nearly five blocks were still inundated by the increasing water level of the Mahananda river.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis situation is due to the water level of the river,\xe2\x80\x9d she told locals.\nFloods have wrecked havoc in Cooch Behar, South Dinajpur, North Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Malda districts of north Bengal.\nAccording to the State Irrigation Department, heavy downpour in Nepal and Bihar is further worsening the situation as the waters released by them is entering Mahananda.\nThey said the Mahananda was flowing 1.5 metres above the extreme danger level in the English Bazar area while some other rivers in the area have also breached the danger level.\nThe State Finance Department was collaborating with other departments, including its irrigation counterpart, to formulate a report on the overall flood situation and damages in the state, said state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe report will be submitted to the Chief Secretary and Chief Minister in about a week,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nThe Chief Minister had earlier alleged floods in southern West Bengal districts were \xe2\x80\x9cman-made\xe2\x80\x9d and held the Centre and the Damodar Valley Corporation responsible for the disaster.\n'

S'Yummy pizzas and burgers might give that satisfaction to your taste buds, but these foods at the same time silently adds to your body weight. Well, this isn\'t all, according to a new research these calorie rich junk foods increases the risk of cancer in women.\nThe researchers wanted to find out how the ratio of energy to food weight, otherwise known as dietary energy density (DED), contributes to cancer risk. They looked at DED in the diets of post-menopausal women.\nThe findings, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, showed that consuming energy dense foods caused 10 percent increase in obesity-related cancer among normal weight women.\n"The demonstrated effect in normal-weight women in relation to risk for obesity-related cancers is novel," explained lead investigator Cynthia Thomson, Professor at Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona in the US.\n"This finding suggests that weight management alone may not protect against obesity-related cancers should women favour a diet pattern indicative of high energy density," Thomson said.\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how DED alone relates to cancer risk, researchers used data on 90,000 postmenopausal women including their diet and any diagnosis of cancer.\nThe researchers found that the higher dietary energy density foods in normal-weight women may cause metabolic dysregulation that is independent of body weight, and this is known to increase cancer risk.\nWhile further study is needed to understand how dietary energy density may play a role in cancer risk for other populations such as young people and men, this information may help persuade postmenopausal women to choose low energy dense foods, even if they are already at a healthy body mass index.\n"Among normal-weight women, higher DED may be a contributing factor for obesity-related cancers," Thomson said.\n'

S'Love it or loathe it, there\'s no denying that Mercedes\' latest creation will turn heads wherever it goes.\nIt\'s called the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet and it combines the luxury of a superyacht with dazzling super-coupe looks and a drop-top roof.\nThe four-wheeled cruise-liner concept was revealed this weekend at Pebble Beach as part of this year\'s Monterey Car Week in California.\nScroll down for video \nA Vision: The Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet was showcased for the first time at the weekend - but what is it?\nThe concept car is a blend of superyacht and luxury car with a high-performance pure-electric powertrain driving it\nFor those of you who are clued-up on your Mercedes concepts, it might look a little familiar. That\'s because it\'s a roofless version of the Vision Maybach 6 luxury coupe concept launched at the same event last year.\nLike it\'s roofed sibling, it will be propelled by an immensely powerful electric powertrain producing enough grunt for this four-wheeled barge to out-sprint most lightweight sports cars in a drag race from a set of traffic lights.\nThe German car maker described it as a \'sensual, emotionally appealing design with "innovative technical concept solutions" that "defines the ultimate in luxury of the future"\'. \nWe think it looks an updated version of Lady Penelope\'s FAB 1 from Thunderbirds.\nWhat it undoubtedly is - looking at the dazzling images of the concept car - is inexplicably enormous.\nUnder the winged bonnet is a storage unit that holds dinner plates, flasks, cutlery, umbrellas and trolley bags\nThe new concept (right) closely resembles the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 luxury coupe (left) that was revealed at the 2016 Pebble Beach Concours d\'Elegance\nChief design officer Gordon Wagener (pictured) unveiled the stunning vehicle in California at the weekend\nMeasuring in at 5.7 metres long and 2.1 metres wide, you\'d struggle to find a parking space to put it in, let alone a garage. And despite the immensity of it, there\'s still only room for just two seats.\nThe massive body is incredibly sleek, though, featuring the same delightfully elegant lines as the original Maybach 6 concept.\nThe new Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet also shares a similar chrome-finished grille and a set of glimmering 24-inch multi-spoke wheels.\nTop up or top down? Unlike Mercedes-Maybach\'s earlier luxury concept car, this one would give the occupants the choice between sheltered and wind-through-your-hair driving \nAt 5.7 metres long and 2.1 metres wide you can forget about looking for a parking space and start considering where to dock it\nThe vehicle stunned onlookers during Monterey Car Week - one of the biggest motoring events in the US calendar\nBut the big difference is the custom-made fabric top that - according to Mercedes - is interwoven with gold threads to epitomise the outlandishness of this boat-like concept.\nIt\'s complimented by a new sloped rear-end design that\'s been crafted to look like the deck of a superyacht. It\'s certainly succeeded in that task, producing a car that looks as though you\'d need to dock somewhere instead of pull over at the side of the road.\nMercedes says the 740bhp electric powertrain - made up of four compact electric motors powering each wheel - can sail to 62mph in under four seconds but only has range of 310 miles.\nThat enormous bonnet looks like it would easily contain a V12 engine, but instead the Vision Maybach 6 Cabriolet has an all-electric powertrain with two electric motors on the front axle and another two at the rear\nBy European economy tests - which tend to be optimistic, especially for electric vehicles - the vehicle can cover 310 miles on a full charge\nThat\'s 70 miles short of the Tesla Model S P100D that you can buy today, though the Maybach 6 Cabriolet can be anchored to a DC fast charger that will boost the range by 60 miles in just five minutes.\nInside, the cabin is lathered in crystal white nappa leather that\'s shaped in the same way as high-end Chesterfield furniture, while the wooden floor is another hint to its yachting inspiration.\nInterior pictures also show a minimalist dashboard that contains three air vents and a blue fibre optics wrap-around panel with the sat-nav visuals incorporated into it.\nThe dashboard has a minimal design and there are barely any buttons in sight. Much of the features are controlled via voice recognition and the driving information is projected onto the windscreen\nDespite the massive dimensions of the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet concept, there is only room for two people\nThe driver gets an instrument cluster made up of two round dials, though much of the information is fed via a pair of head-up displays that are projected onto the windscreen.\nThe eagle-eyed among you will spot the lack of buttons to adjust the temperature, radio and other setting inside the vehicle - that\'s because most of the features will be activated using a Concierge voice control system designed to understand natural speech.\nAnd as a final flurry of extravagance, the double-hinged bonnet opens like a pair of wings and reveals a decked storage unit that holds a variety of items, from dinner plates, flasks and cutlery to a pair of umbrellas and a luggage set.\nThe car has a 0-to-62mph time of less than four seconds - that\'s better than most lightweight sports cars you can buy today\nThe massive chrome-plated grille is similar to that of the Visions Mercedes-Maybach 6 coupe showcased 12 months earlier\nBeing a concept, it\'s highly unlikely that the car will ever be put into production. Were it to go on sale, it would easily eclipse the \xc2\xa3260,000 starting price for the Maybach S 650 Cabriolet launched last year.\nHowever, the electric powertrain and some of the design cues could suggest what Mercedes and Maybach models could be like in the future. \nTaken by the boat-like looks? Or does the design make you feel sea sick? Let us know in the comments section below?\n'

S'Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) removed the final Avro RJ100 from flight operations today after over 15 years as part of its fleet. The last of a total of 21 aircraft took off from Geneva this morning and made its last official landing at Zurich airport.\nImmediately after landing in Zurich, the aircraft registered under HB-IYZ received the traditional water fountain salute by the airport fire brigade before being officially taken out of service to loud applause from a crowd of employees and aviation fans. This special flight, operated under number LX7545, carried a mix of media professionals, staff and other guests. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking this final landing at our home airport aboard an Avro was a very emotional experience for me! The taking out of service of the Avro aircraft marks the end of an era in the history of aviation in Switzerland\xe2\x80\x9d says Michael Weisser, Captain and Avro fleet chief, who performed the flight from Geneva to Zurich with his deputy fleet chief Captain Peter Huber.\nThe Avro RJ100 and its smaller version, the Avro RJ85, formed the backbone of the SWISS European fleet since the company was founded in 2002. The Avro fleet has completed over 700,000 hours in the air. During that time SWISS made over half a million flights with this British Aerospace (BAe) aircraft. With their record for excellent maintenance quality, these former SWISS aircraft remain in high demand despite their age, and will go into service with other airlines.\nExtensive fleet renewal\nSWISS continues to push ahead with the programme of fleet modernisation which it commenced in early 2016. By the end of 2018, another 20 Bombardier C Series aircraft will join the existing fleet of 10 currently deployed on our short and medium-haul routes. On the long-haul routes, two further Boeing 777-300ERs will replace part of the Airbus A340 fleet by spring 2018. All this means that SWISS will have one of the youngest fleets in Europe by the end of 2018.\nSource:- SWISS\n'

S'Tourism Ireland has teamed up with Stena Line and Rosslare Europort once again, to promote Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Ancient East and, in particular, counties Wexford, Waterford and Kilkenny. A joint campaign \xe2\x80\x93 supported by Wexford, Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils \xe2\x80\x93 is now under way, highlighting ease of access via the Stena Line ferry service from Fishguard to Rosslare. A similar campaign was rolled out this spring.\nThe campaign is targeting our \xe2\x80\x98culturally curious\xe2\x80\x99 audience in Britain and includes:\n\xe2\x80\x93 radio ads, reaching some 1.73 million listeners in London, South West England and South Wales, on Classic FM, Smooth Radio and regional radio stations;\n\xe2\x80\x93 online ads on popular websites, reaching millions more British travellers; and\n\xe2\x80\x93 ads on Facebook.\nAs well as highlighting ease of access, the ads are encouraging British holidaymakers to \xe2\x80\x9cStir your soul \xe2\x80\xa6 Drive over to Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Ancient East\xe2\x80\x9d.\nJulie Wakley, Tourism Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Head of Britain, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are delighted to partner with Stena Line and Rosslare Europort once again, to maximise the promotion of the Stena Line service from Fishguard to Rosslare. Our aim is to boost car touring visitor numbers to the South East and Ireland over the coming months; visitors who bring their car on holidays tend to stay longer, spend more and are more likely to visit more than one region. \n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Britain is a vital market for tourism to the island of Ireland. It delivers 47% of all overseas visitors and around 30% of all overseas tourism revenue. However, the decline in the value of sterling is certainly a challenge for Irish tourism from Britain right now, which means that competitiveness and the value for money message are more important than ever. Tourism Ireland is placing a greater focus on our \xe2\x80\x98culturally curious\xe2\x80\x99 audience, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations. We are also undertaking an expanded programme with key partners, like this campaign with Stena Line, communicating a strong price-led message.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSource:- Tourism Ireland\n'

S'Panaji: While grounding of casino ship MV Lucky 7 at the Miramar beach became an issue in the campaign for August 23 Panaji by-election, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Monfay promised "quick action" after the code of conduct is lifted. The ship ran aground in the second week of July due to heavy rains after hitting the Aguada sand bar.\nFile Photo\nIt is still stuck on the beach, with activists fearing possibility of environmental damage to the coastline.\n "If I intervene at this time, everyone will say that I am doing it for election. So let the (period of) election code of conduct get over. I will take quick action," said Parrikar, who is contesting the by-election to the Assembly from Panaji.\n Removing the ship won\'t be difficult, as it is smaller than `River Princess\' which had run aground on Candolim shore in 2000, he said.\n "River Princess was 67,000 tonnes trans-shiper, while this (Lucky 7) is 4,000 tonnes," Parrikar said.\n The opposition Congress made beaching of casino vessel a poll issue. Party\'s state unit chief, Shantaram Naik, demanded registration of FIR against Parrikar for "negligence". Congress candidate Girish Chodankar even started his campaign from Miramar beach itself.\n Goa has five off-shore casinos anchored in River Mandovi, while Lucky 7 was on its way to join them before it ran aground.\n The Congress, in its by-election manifesto, has assured to shift all the casinos from the Mandovi.\n Parrikar said casino cannot be an issue in this election. "I have already explained on the floor of the House what steps the state government intends to take to shift casinos from river Mandovi. I will start working on that after the election," he said, when pointed out that removal of casinos does not figure in BJP\'s manifesto. \n'

S' As Chinese automakers look to break into the U.S. market, we\'ve been hearing about how companies in China are courting FCA. After GM and Volkswagen each shut the possibility of a merger, an unnamed Chinese company stepped up to the table. Its offer to buy FCA was refused, but the suitors are still knocking. Now, Automotive News reports that Chinese automaker Great Wall is interested in making a deal specifically to purchase the Jeep brand.\n Great Wall President Wang Fengying told Automotive News in an email that her company is "connecting with FCA" to start the negotiation process. FCA, though, told the publication that it hasn\'t been approached by Great Wall. Great Wall\'s offer, if accepted, would separate Jeep \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x94 FCA\'s most valuable brand \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x94 from the rest of the FCA portfolio.\n It\'s not unthinkable that FCA would consider selling Jeep on its own. FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne has said he\'d consider spinning off Jeep and Ram. The company also said it could see making Maserati and Alfa Romeo into a separate company as well. Jeep, though, might be worth more on its own that the entirety of FCA with Jeep included, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. This complicates the matter for any potential buyer that owns FCA franchise dealerships, and for FCA, for which Jeep is an attractor for selling the company as a whole.\n Great Wall, which only generates $14.7 billion in annual revenue (compared to FCA\'s $131 billion), is confident it could raise the funds to buy Jeep. As Automotive News points out, though, there could be a bidding war brewing if Jeep can be bought separately from the rest of the brands.\n Still, As Great Wall spokesman Xu Hui said, the company has been following Jeep, and sees it as a key to achieving its goal of becoming "the world\'s largest SUV maker." Great Wall already has research and development facilities in Detroit and Los Angeles. The Chinese company is also considering building a factory in the U.S. rather than in Mexico. Whether or not Great Wall acquires Jeep, it wants to sell SUVs in the U.S., and having a factory in the States means it wouldn\'t have to worry about Trump renegotiating NAFTA.\n Jeep is currently expanding its market presence, and has new vehicles, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, on the way in 2019.\n'

S'After months of speculation, rumors, and reports, VW has finally confirmed that it will produce the I.D. Buzz, its all-electric homage to the Microbus.\nThe decision was announced today at the Pebble Beach Concours d\xe2\x80\x99Elegance, a part of the prestigious Monterey Car Week.\nThe I.D. Buzz is being targeted at Europe, China, and\xe2\x80\x94most excitingly\xe2\x80\x94the US. Volkswagenpredicts that it will hit showrooms in 2022.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the presentations at the global motor shows in Detroit and Geneva, we received a large number of letters and emails from customers who said, \xe2\x80\x98please build this car\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said VW CEO Dr. Herbert Diess. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Microbus has long been part of the California lifestyle. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing it back by reinventing it as an electric vehicle.\nThe Buzz will do more than just rekindle Beach Boys memories, though, it will also be put to work, as Eckhard Scholz, CEO of VW Commercial Vehicles, explained.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong with a minibus version, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be offering an I.D. BUZZ CARGO variant for zero-emissions delivery of goods,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scholz. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Level 3 autonomous capability, this is an ideal concept for an electric van, particularly for delivering packages and goods to the inner cities.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe I.D. Buzz was first introduced at the North American International Auto Show and is based on the exclusively electric MEB platform. With variable amounts of batteries under the floor, and electric motors both fore and aft, the Buzz benefits from a low center of gravity and more interior volume than any similarly sized internal combustion engine competitor.\nThe platform is also what allows the Buzz to actually be produced. Over the years VW has produced many concepts that sought to interpret the cab forward design, but safety considerations would have made production versions impractical or ugly. This version, though, thanks to its lack of engine and VW\xe2\x80\x99s access to modern materials can pass safety tests while also looking good.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hinrich Woebcken, head of VW\xe2\x80\x99s North American market. \xe2\x80\x9cThis vehicle is the perfect balance between emotion, usability and sustainability, while also showcasing our technological leadership. The high seating position, cargo capacity, overall versatility and all-wheel drive option packaged into such an appealing design is just what our customers want from us. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect fit for the zero-emissions American lifestyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA version of this story originally appeared on VW Vortex\nDiscuss this story on our Volkswagen Forum\n Filed under: Featured Articles German Minivans Videos Volkswagen\n Tags: i.d. buzz, Volkswagen \n'

S'She\'s all about "found fitness" moments. \nPhotograph courtesy of Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\nFinding time to work out can be tough, even for the biggest exercise fans. But fitness experts repeatedly stress that you can find little ways to add exercising into your life, even when you\xe2\x80\x99re totally pressed for time. Known as \xe2\x80\x9cfound fitness,\xe2\x80\x9d devotees swear that you can get exercises in while you\xe2\x80\x99re doing random things like household chores, waiting for a flight, or even just hanging out at your place.\nYoga instructor, businesswoman, and mother of three Hilaria Baldwin is one of those found fitness advocates, and she talks about how she tackles it in her book,  The Living Clearly Method . It\'s not just lip service\xe2\x80\x94she actually does these things, and clearly they work. In case you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble thinking up found fitness ideas, Hilaria\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram account is filled with her own moments. Here are just a few you can steal from her:\nA post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin) on Apr 8, 2017 at 4:56pm PDT\nWork your core while waiting for an elevator\nPut yourself into a plank position and make sure your body is level with the floor. Then, engage your core, jog your knees for 10 to 20 seconds, and repeat it four times (if the elevator doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come first).\nA post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin) on Aug 2, 2017 at 7:15pm PDT\nYou can do whatever poses you love in bed, but Hilaria stretches from side to side, lifts her legs and core for a mini ab workout, and then goes into a little shavasana. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to get ready for bed. (Get toned in just minutes a day with WH\'s With Yoga DVD.)\nA post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin) on Jul 31, 2017 at 12:50pm PDT\nIf you have kids, use their stroller to balance yourself as you do leg lifts behind you. (Hilaria recommends three sets of 15 reps on each side.)

S'Last night, Lakm\xc3\xa9Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 wrapped up with a star-studded Manish Malhotra final\xc3\xa9, but of course! Now, as usual, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to sift through all the shining, matte, contoured, holographic and what-not makeup trends from the week-long extravaganza. And, like always, there are a few looks that stood out above them all.\nFeast your eyes on the coolest makeup trends from Lakm\xc3\xa9 Fashion Week Winter / Festive 2017.\n1. Masaba Gupta\nAfter Masaba\xe2\x80\x99s recent lip launch with Lakm\xc3\xa9, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting anything less than this avant garde look on her runway. The candy-coloured lips add a pop of colour to those stark brows. And talk about highlighting the inner corner of your eye! Gold, liquid foil should do the trick.\n#HauteTip: While the runway always seems to go for an exaggerated version, highlighting the inner corner of your eye really is the quickest way to make your eyes look more fresh and awake.\n2. Sunita Shanker\nThe attention is still on the lips, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at Instagram or the runway! High pigments, high gloss, high definition, and glitter of course! We love the sparkles on this well-defined, red lip.\n#HauteHack: Metallic lips, glitter lips, or strobe lips\xe2\x80\xa6 all the Youtubers of the world are showing you how to get the look. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for models anymore. The statement lip has become super wearable.\n3. Paramparik Karigar, Rouka, & Aranya Natural\nTo amplify the boho vibe of the silhouettes, the makeup pros at LFW drew face art on the models. Flower face painting adorned the side of their faces as they walked down the runway.\n#HauteHack: Not planning to go to a music festival anytime soon? That\xe2\x80\x99s alright; you can still wear this look. Got a big night out? Cut out stencils like you used to back in school, stick them to your face and fill them in with liner. To keep it subtle, try smaller patterns.\n4. Akaaro\nMakeup rule numero uno? Always bring out the centre of your face and shadow the sides for the appearance of a thinner face. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the rule of contouring and highlighting? This silver, metallic look for Akaaro is practically the same thing, just way more amplified.\n#HauteHack: Use this as a chart and start highlighting places that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just the top of your cheekbones!\n5. Indegene, Sayantan Sarkar, & Sailesh Singhania\nLet me introduce you to the \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect\xe2\x80\x9d lip. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a blur lip, or a stained lip, but it runs out of the lines. It\xe2\x80\x99s messy, but also beautiful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? We love the undone feel to the entire look, like the model was trying to remove her makeup, but the wipes ain\xe2\x80\x99t cutting it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been there!\n#HauteHack: Opt for the blur lip trend by applying a nude on your lip and a pink, orange, or red stain in the center of your lips. Then, dab to get the desired effect.\n6. Manish Arora\nIf you love pearly skin, then Manish Arora\xe2\x80\x99s show took that to a whole new level by applying pearls on the highlight zones of his models\xe2\x80\x99 skin. The look also features a very prominent, warm contour and millennial pink dusted on the eyelids.\n#HauteHack: Use different shades of pink blush to create a millennial pink eyeshadow look that\xe2\x80\x99s super on trend.\n7. Nachiket Barve\nThe experts at LFW created a holographic liner, a la Instagram, for models walking the Nachiket Barve runway. There was little else on the face, giving the models an almost futuristic look.\n#HauteHack: Try creating a 3D effect on your liner by adding different colours to one liner look. Start with silver and end the wing with gold. Use metallic colours for a cool finish.\n8. Divya Reddy & Jayanti Reddy\nThe models at the Divya Reddy, and the consecutive Jayanti Reddy show, were glimmering with tears of liquid gold. It looked very Instagram-inspired, over the top, and absolutely gorgeous!\n#HauteHack: Since metals aren\xe2\x80\x99t going out of style anytime soon, play around with metallic eyeshadow and a few drops of lens solution to create that pigmented liquid effect!\n9. Rara Avis by Sonal Verma\nPlums and browns aren\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere this season! Both, Rara Avis makeup looks consisted of a smoky cat eye with a super sultry effect.\n#HauteHack: I would tell you how to tone this look down, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t need that! When in doubt, a smoky cat-eye always brings a twist to your makeup look. Just make sure you add some color under your lower lash-line and smoke that out too, in order to complete the look.\nGET HAUTERFLY IN YOUR INBOX!\n'

S'Solo travel is a surprisingly divisive way to vacation: it\xe2\x80\x99s something people either love or loathe. I have a strong love/hate relationship with solo travel\xe2\x80\x94there are some aspects that I treasure (being able to do whatever I want, whenever I want) and others I dread (feeling lonely). I\xe2\x80\x99ve found though, that the things I hate most about solo travel have actually helped me become a happier and more confident explorer. Here are my least favorite things about solo travel, and the reasons why they will make you a better traveler.\nWorst Things About Solo Travel (That Are Actually Good for You)\nEating Alone\n  No matter how confident you are, the words \xe2\x80\x9ctable for one please\xe2\x80\x9d can be tough to utter, especially in a foreign country. But, eating out alone helps boost confidence (once you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it a few times, it gets easier), and often times leads to meeting new people, especially if you opt to sit at the bar to dine instead of at a table. This can be particularly great if you utilize your solo travel status to meet locals while you\xe2\x80\x99re eating\xe2\x80\x94you can get some amazing tips about your destination this way.  \nThe Single Supplement\nThe single supplement\xe2\x80\x94 the premium charge that many vacation companies or cruise lines levy upon solo travelers for having the audacity to take up a room all to themselves\xe2\x80\x94can feel like a penalty tax for traveling alone.\nHowever, if you research, you can find plenty of cruise providers and tours that are designed to work with single travelers (and have special, smaller rooms that don\xe2\x80\x99t incur a solo supplement, or will waive the surcharge if you agree to be matched up with a roommate). Here is a good round-up of solo-friendly travel companies. Bonus: solo-friendly companies tend to be great at helping people traveling alone meet others.\nNot Having Anyone to Watch your Stuff\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all been there\xe2\x80\x94that epic struggle to squeeze yourself and your suitcase into a tiny bathroom stall because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone you trust to watch your bag. After you\xe2\x80\x99ve done that dance once or twice, you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn how to pack light quickly, which can increase your sense of self-reliance and resourcefulness.\nHaving to Rely on Yourself\nWhen I travel with other people, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to let others compensate for my weaknesses. For example, if I\xe2\x80\x99m traveling with someone who speaks the local language, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just sit back and let my companion do all the talking on a trip. When I\xe2\x80\x99m on a solo travel journey, I have no other choice but to solve all of my own problems as they arise\xe2\x80\x94which can mean getting better at languages, navigation, currency converting, and everything else that comes with the new territory.\nNot Having Anyone to Take Your Picture\nSolo travel means fewer cliched travel photos\xe2\x80\x94because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a built-in photographer by your side. Rather than mourn the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re missing out on great Instagram shots, focus on the positive\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to be present and enjoy the moment than you would if you were worrying about getting the perfect pose. Either that, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll perfect your selfie skills, both of which are causes for celebration.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s No Safety in the Number One\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of safety in numbers, and traveling alone can be scary\xe2\x80\x94and feel limiting. You may be less likely to go for a walk at night, might not want to explore the local nightlife, or decide to pass on tasting the signature cocktail at your destination. And that can be a good thing, because you force yourself to try other activities for entertainment that you might not have considered if you were traveling in a group.\nNot Having Anyone to Talk To\nWhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve just experienced something amazing and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone to share the moment with, solo travel can feel lonely. But, solo travel also means that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone to distract you\xe2\x80\x94so you can take time to journal your thoughts about an experience uninterrupted, or meditate/reflect peacefully without having to make small talk.\n'

S"Dia Mirza, Disha Patani and several other Bollywood celebrities made quite a striking appearance at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 that concluded last night with Manish Malhotra's show. \nLakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 has come to an end. A 5 day long fashion gala, the winter collection was astounding. This season of Lakme Fashion Week saw some stunning designs, some budding talented designers and of course Bollywood celebrities who looked their best wearing some of the most glitzy outfits. The first three days of this fashion extravagance saw more of traditional and Indian ethnic outfits. Celebrities wore outfits in accordance with the theme of the collection. The last two days however were super glamorous. Not only did the ramp sizzle with shimmering and glitzy outfits, but all the celebrities who were in the audience also wore some really stunning outfits that totally stole the show. And if we had to mention about one outfits that really stood out, then we would obviously go with Ranveer Singh who is known to experiment with fashion. This time too at the Lakme Fashion Week, Ranveer Singh wore a shining rainbow jacket. This jacket was so bright that we are sure the venue did not need any more lighting. Ranveer Singh made this special appearance for designer Manish Arora\xe2\x80\x99s show, who is known to display a riot of colors in most of his designs. And who better than Ranveer Singh to pull of the designer\xe2\x80\x99s signature style. While Ranveer did make a striking appearance, there were other celebrities as well who wore some gorgeous, shimmering outfits. We have put together some photos of the best dressed celebrities who were spotted at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 that includes Ranveer Singh and Dia Mirza among others. Check out the pictures!\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s Ranveer Singh bringing some bling to the show wearing this quirky rainbow jacket! He wore this jacket with black pants which we think was a wise choice. And the best part was he pulled this off effortlessly.\nAnother beauty who brought some glamour to the runway with her glitzy outfit is Sunny Leone. She wore this floor length, mermaid dress with glittering sequence. This shimmering dress brought out the best of Sunny Leone.\nDia Mirza was truly the star of Lakme Fashion Week this season.

S"Chennai, Aug 21 (PTI) Former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerslevam was today sworn-in as deputy to current incumbent K Palaniswami, hours after the merger of the two AIADMK factions.\nAt a simple ceremony at the Raj Bhavan, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao administered the oath of office and secrecy to Panneerselvam.\nThe former chief minister is back in his home turf finance, a portfolio he had held since 2011 when the J Jayalalithaa government was sworn-in.\nHe held it till his resignation as chief minister in February to make way for jailed AIADMK chief V K Sasikala, who despite being appointed leader of the AIADMK Legislature party did not become the chief minister.\nThis was following her conviction and subsequent imprisonment at the Bengaluru prison in the disproportionate assets case.\nEven when Panneerselvam stepped in for Jayalalithaa as a replacement following her conviction in the assets case in 2014 and even after her death in December 2016, he continued to hold the Finance portfolio.\nHis close aide K Pandiarajan was sworn-in as minister for Tamil official language and Tamil culture.\nSince the former chief minister's rebellion against Sasikala, D Jayakumar had been entrusted with finance, besides fisheries.\nBesides finance, Panneerselvam was allocated housing, rural housing and housing development, Slum Clearance Board and Accommodation Control, Town Planning, urban development and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority.\nPandiarajan was earlier the School Education minister in late Jayalalithaa cabinet following a reshuffle in August 2016.\nHe had later joined Panneerselvam post the latter's revolt against Sasikala.\nJayakumar will hold the fisheries portfolio.\nPandiarajan has also been given the portfolio of archaeology, hitherto held by Sevoor S Ramachandran and K A Sengottaiyan, respectively.\nUdumalai K Radhakrishnan has been allotted animal husbandry, hitherto held by P Balakrishna Reddy with the latter now being made the Minister for Youth Welfare and Sports Development, earlier held by Sengottaiyan.\nFurther, Mines and Minerals hitherto held by Industries Minister MC Sampath was allotted to C Ve Shanmugam, who is the law minister.\nPanneerselvam was first made the finance minister by Jayalalithaa when the AIADMK came to power in 2011 though he has held other portfolios earlier.\nHe was interim chief minister twice when Jayalalithaa stepped down due to cases against her, and then chief minister following her death on December 5, 2016.\n"

S'Three days after the assaults, a picture was emerging of an imam who may have radical leanings. \nRipoll: In a little Spanish town by the Pyrenees mountains, a Moroccan imam has come under intense scrutiny, accused of creating the terror cell that allegedly launched the twin attacks in Spain.\n Those who knew him described Abdelbaki Es Satty as a discreet and religious man, who had recently asked for a holiday from the mosque he was preaching in, apparently to return to Morocco for personal business.\n But police believe he may have been among those blown up in an accidential explosion Wednesday in the house where the suspected attackers were believed to be building bombs.\n The blast likely changed the plans of the attackers, who instead used vehicles to smash into pedestrians on Barcelona\'s busy Las Ramblas boulevard and in the seaside resort town of Cambrils.\n "On Tuesday morning, he left saying he was going on vacation to Morocco," said fruit-seller Nordeen El Haji, 45, who four months ago moved into the apartment that Satty occupied in Ripoll.\n The decrepit two-room flat rented for 150 euros a month has a view of the tree-covered Pyrenees and the red roofs of the quaint Catalonian town, 90 kilometres (50 miles) north of Barcelona.\n \'No internet, few books\' \n "He spoke little, spent time with his computer in his room, and had an old mobile phone with no internet, and few books," said Satty\'s flatmate.\n On a piece of furniture lies the police search order dated Friday, just after the twin attacks that claimed 14 lives and wounded 120 people.\n Three days after the assaults, a picture was emerging of an imam who may have radical leanings.\n El Mundo newspaper, quoting anti-terrorist sources, said that in 2012 Satty left prison where "he had struck up a special friendship with another detainee, Rachid Aglif, nicknamed \'the rabbit\'."\n Aglif had been sentenced to 18 years over the March 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks that killed 191 people, the worst terror attack on European soil.\nDrug trafficking\n The imam had been placed in provisional detention for drug trafficking, the newspaper said, adding that "he was shifting hashish between Ceuta and Algesiras".\n Catalonia police chief Josep Lluis Trapero confirmed that the imam "had a judicial problem, but not linked to terrorism".\n As local media speculated on the influence of the imam on the young attackers, his flatmate said that in the last four months, he had not hosted any youths in the apartment.\n "This imam was normal and ordinary in public," said Mohamed Akhayad, a 26-year-old Moroccan electrician-mechanic, who sometimes went to the prayer hall that opened in 2016 where he preached.\n "If he ate up the brains of these youths, he must have done it secretly, in a secret place," he said at the main Moroccan cafe in town.\n \'Very solitary\' \n Another Moroccan, who did not want to give his name, described the imam as "very solitary, and hung out more with these youths than with people of his age".\n The 43-year-old man said he knew the young suspects in the attacks, as he had organised football matches with them.\n The imam "was always dressed in black", he said, adding: "We saw very little of him at the Moroccan cafe".\n In Sant Pere street where the imam lived, a 64-year-old local, Francesc Gimeno, said the man "had a reputation of being very Islamist".\n "He wanted all the Moroccans to think like him, putting religion above all," said Gimeno, saying he also "required Moroccan women in town to cover themselves".\n But Hammou Minhaj, 30, a Moroccan and secretary of Ripoll\'s Muslim community, said: "He doesn\'t say that here at the mosque. Outside, I don\'t know."\n Satty arrived in Ripoll in 2015, said Minhaj.\n \'Knows the Koran better than us\' \n But then "he went to Belgium as imam, at least that\'s what he said, before returning to Ripoll," added Minhaj.\n "He started as an imam in our new mosque in April 2016. What\'s important is that he knows the Koran better than we do."\n But at the end of June, the imam asked for three months\' leave to go to Morocco on holiday, Minhaj said.\n In Belgium, the mayor of the Vilvorde region told AFP that Satty spent time in the Brussels suburb of Machelen between January and March 2016.\n Brussel\'s Molenbeek suburb has gained notoriety as a hotbed of international jihadists after the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n In the Moroccan town of M\'rirt, relatives of the 22-year-old suspect hunted by police, Younes Abouyaaqoub, also accused the imam of radicalising the young man as well as his brother Houssein.\n "Over the last two years, Younes and Houssein began to radicalise under the influence of this imam," their grandfather told AFP.\n Spanish media believe Younes may have been the man who drove the van into crowds in Barcelona.\n A neighbour close to the Abouyaaquob family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the imam "had recruited Moroccans of Ripoll and planned the attacks".\n "He took leave from the mosque saying he had to return to Morocco to deal with inheritance problems.\n "So another imam was found to replace him at the mosque, but a few days before the attacks, he was seen in Ripoll," added the source, who also has family in the small town.\n'

S'Aston Martin DBR1 sold for $22.55 million at the Monterey Car Week and broke the earlier record set by Jaguar D-Type\nThe Aston Martin DBR1 is a British icon and at the RM Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s Monterey sale the very first unit of the model built has been sold for $22.55 million (Rs. 144.41 crore). In doing so, it has now become the most expensive British car ever sold at an auction. There are many different reasons to buy this DBR1 as it was driven by several greats.\nSome of the special ones include Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Jack Brabham, the legendaryCarroll Shelby, Reg Parnell and Roy Salvadori. With Stirling Moss behind the wheel, this DBR1 took victory at the grueling Nurburgring 1000 km race and is the most authentic among the five DBR1s currently in existence.\nThe DBR1 went past the previous British record holder, the Jaguar D-Type at $21.78 million, when the final price was put up. This model participated in the 1956, 1957 and 1958 editions of the Le Mans 24 hours race and is the sister car to the 1959 title winning DBR1 at the notorious endurance event.\nThe Aston Martin DBR1 is the brand\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent to the Ferrari 250 GTO and Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. This chassis number one is a purpose-built model created by Ted Cutting, Aston Martin\xe2\x80\x99s design chief. After winning the 1000 Km race in Germany, it was sold and converted for street use in 1962.\nThe DBR1 uses an inline six-cylinder engine evolved from 1956. Even though its last race in 1959 saw the 2,992cc motor making 268 hp, it currently has a modern engine with output raised to 301 hp and has no sense of history. The \xe2\x80\x9cmost important\xe2\x80\x9d Aston Martin ever produced joins the likes of other classic Astons like a 1959 DB4GT, which sold for $6.765 million, and a 2006 DBR9, which garnered $616,000.\nAt the end of the annual auction at Monterey Car Week on Friday, RM Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s Monterey sale accumulated sales of over $60 million.\n'

S' Lt Col Purohit had moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court\'s order dismissing his bail plea. During the August 17 hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Lt Col Purohit, had said that he has been in jail for the past nine years, but charges have still not been framed against him. \nNew Delhi: The Supreme Court will give its verdict on the bail plea of 2008 Malegaon blast accused Lt Colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit today. The National Investigating Agency or NIA had opposed his bail during the last hearing and argued that there was evidence against Lt Col Purohit.\n On August 17, the Supreme Court had reserved its verdict on Lt Col Purohit\'s plea seeking interim bail. A bench of Justices RK Agrawal and AM Sapre had said it will pass an order on the plea.\nLt Col Purohit had moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court\'s order dismissing his bail plea. During the hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Lt Col Purohit, had said that he has been in jail for the past nine years, but charges have still not been framed against him. He said that the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act or MCOCA charge has already been dropped against him and therefore he is entitled to getting interim bail.\n Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, appearing for the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said however, that there was some evidence against Lt Col Purohit which would help in framing of charge. \n With regard to a plea seeking the cancellation of bail of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, a co-accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, the court posted the matter for hearing on October 10.\n Nisar Ahmed Haji Sayed Bilal, father of one of the blast victims, had challenged the Bombay High Court order granting bail to Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur alleging that she was a "powerful person" and could influence the witnesses in the case.\n He has sought a stay on the high court\'s April 25 order granting her bail, saying there was "no prima facie evidence against her".\n The Supreme Court had on July 28 sought Maharashtra government\'s reply on the plea seeking cancellation of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur\'s bail.\n The National Investigation Agency or NIA had filed its reply in Lt Col Purohit\'s case, saying there was ample evidence against him, but no evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Thakur.\n The top court had on May 5 also sought a response from the NIA and the Maharashtra government on the plea of Lt Col Purohit seeking bail.\n Seven people were killed in a bomb blast on September 29, 2008, at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nasik district of north Maharashtra.\n A special MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) court had earlier ruled that the Anti-Terrorist Squad had wrongly applied this law against Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Lt Col Purohit and nine others.\n The 4,000-page charge sheet had alleged that Malegaon was selected as the blast target because of a sizeable Muslim population there. It had named Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Lt Col Purohit and co-accused, Swami Dayanand Pandey as the key conspirators.\n It had alleged that it was Dayanand Pandey who had instructed Prasad Purohit to arrange explosive RDX, while Sadhvi Pragya Thakur owned the motorcycle which was used in the blast.\n Ajay Rahirkar, another accused, allegedly organised funds for the terror act, while conspiracy meetings were held at the Bhonsala Military School in Nasik, it had said.\n Rakesh Dhawde, Ramesh Upadhyay, Shyamlal Sahu, Shivnarain Kalsangra, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Jagdish Mhatre and Sameer Kulkarni were the other accused.\n'

Launched alongside its drop-top younger cousin, the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster, the new AMG GT R is possibly one of the most exotic Mercedes cars to own in India right now and here\'s all you need to know about the \'Beast of the Green Hell\'.\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R is much affectionately known as the \'Beast of the Green Hell\' for the fact that the car has spent most of its development time at the Nurburgring Circuit, one of the toughest race track in the world, which is called the \'Green Hell\' for its pristine surrounding.  \nRoland Folger and Christian Hohenadel with the Mercedes-AMG GT R\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R is the most powerful model from the GT family and comes with the Affalterbach tuned 4-litre bi-turbo V8 engine code-named M177 that churns out 577 bhp of power and a whopping 700 Nm of peak torque. All that power is sent to the rear wheels via the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\nIn addition to being the most powerful GT model, the GT R is also the fastest Mercedes-Benz model in India right now with a top speed of 318 kmph and the ability to go from 0-100 kmph in just 3.6 seconds.  \n  The 4-litre V6 makes the GT R one of the most powerful Mercedes road cars in India \nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R recently broke the record for a production street legal road car at the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) by clocking the fastest lap of 2:09.853. The AMG GT R also has the lap record at the Nurburgring for a rear-wheel drive car, clocking a time of 7:09.10.\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R is also very light-footed compared to the standard GT S, which is already on sale in India. The roof is made of carbon fibre to ensure high rigidity without having to compromise on safety, while the 20-inch 5-spoke AMG wheels are made of aluminium to ensure weight savings. With such weight saving components the Mercedes-AMG GT R tips the scales at 1630 kg (kerb), which is 15 kg lighter than the standard GT S.  \n  The Mercedes-AMG GT R takes styling cues from the GT3 race car \nIn terms of design and styling the GT R takes inspiration from the GT3 race car-right down to its "Panamericana" grille inspired by some of Mercedes\' classic racers. The LED projector units and sharp LED DRLs adds to the car\'s aggressive appearance, while the wider carbon fenders and enlarged air intakes boost cooling to match the upgraded engine. At the rear, the car comes with a new exhaust system which aims to deliver a race car sound along with horizontal LED tail lamps. The car gets 19-inch wheels at the front and 20-inch wheels at the rear.\nMercedes-Benz India head Roland Folger has said that never before has so much sport technology gone into to making of a Mercedes road car. And these features include active rear-wheel steering, the nine-way adjustable traction control system and the adjustable coil-over suspension with additional electronic control. Additionally, the large rear aerofoil and the double diffuser enhance aerodynamic efficiency and help ensure optimum grip.  \n  The Mercedes-AMG GT R gets black leather interior with contrast yellow seatbelts \nInside the cabin, Mercedes-AMG has fitted the car with the standard AMG-style interior with race-style seats wrapped in black Nappa leather and DINAMICA microfiber. Want to add a bit of contrast, you get to add optional yellow seatbelts and similarly coloured yellow badging on the headrest.\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R comes to India as AMG completes 50 years across the globe. The car has taken the CBU route to India and will be retailed out of the Mercedes-Benz\'s Performance Centres across the country. Price, as we mentioned before, is right now Rs. 2.23 onwards (ex-showroom, India) with several customisation options that will add to the bill if chosen.\nFor the latest auto news and reviews, follow CarAndBike on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n'

S'Through the ages, people have documented total solar eclipses. Here, an artistic depiction of the July 29, 1878 total solar eclipse by E.L. Trouvelot.\n Paul Sutter is an astrophysicist at The Ohio State University and the chief scientist at COSI Science Center. Sutter leads science-themed tours around the world at AstroTouring.com. Sutter contributed this article to Space.com\'s Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n People enjoy looking at the sky. People enjoy writing down minute details of their daily lives. Ergo, when people see something interesting in the sky, they write it down. We have historic \xe2\x80\x94 and surprisingly, prehistoric \xe2\x80\x94 records of celestial events going back thousands of years, including solar eclipses. So when you pick just the right Instagram filter for your "solar selfie" this Aug. 21, you\'re following in the footsteps of an ancient and noble tradition. (Note: Do not photograph an eclipse without a safe solar filter when any portion of the sun is visible.)\n Due to their very nature, prehistoric records of solar eclipses are the hardest to interpret. Does that swirly thing represent the sun? Are the concentric circles the full moon? The new moon? And what about those zigzags? If we\'re correctly interpreting the petroglyphs on the ancient monuments near Loughcrew, Ireland, then the oldest recorded solar eclipse dates to 3340 B.C.\n Once we enter written history things get a little more reliable. A peculiar tale comes down to us telling the story of Chinese Emperor Chung K\'ang, who apparently beheaded his court astronomers for failing to predict the eclipse of 2137 B.C. While the anecdote may be purely apocryphal, it is a good way to frighten young astronomers around the campfire. [Total Solar Eclipse 2017: When, Where and How to See It (Safely)]\n I should mention that the Chinese went on to record nearly a thousand eclipses from the eighth century B.C. until the fifth century B.C., with no associated beheadings reported. \n They weren\'t alone, however. The Babylonians and Greeks busied themselves recording solar eclipses, using colorful language like "the sun was put to shame," as one ancient clay tablet attests. Solar eclipses were too hard to predict with any degree of confidence with the limited accuracy available to the ancients \xe2\x80\x94 poor consolation to the Chinese court astronomers, I know \xe2\x80\x94 but as far as we can tell, all the civilizations that kept track of eclipses quickly realized that they were a result of the natural motions of the sun and moon. \n That said, the astrological worldview posited that the motions of the heavens were connected to earthly events, so solar eclipses weren\'t necessarily to be feared (at least, by the intelligentsia of their respective cultures), but were used to read the fortunes of emperors, generals, religious leaders and other important folk. [10 Solar Eclipses That Changed Science] \n Entering the scientific era of astronomy, solar eclipses began to be used for more than just finding a tenuous connection to the fortunes of the big boss. Observers began to study the corona in more detail, discovering helium (Helios, like the Greek god of the sun \xe2\x80\x94 get the name now?) in the process. Later on, they would be used to verify the prediction of general relativity that massive objects can bend the path of light.\n These days, as on Aug. 21, they will be an opportunity to ooh and ah at the beauty of the natural world while simultaneously doing research. And no beheadings.\n'

S' Wayanad leg of Periya-Kottiyur corridor key to mitigating human-wildlife conflict in the region \nThe Forest Department is drawing up plans to restore the Wayanad leg of the Periya-Kottiyur elephant corridor, considered key to mitigating human-wildlife conflict in the region.\nThe Centre had approved the corridor project in 2007 at an estimate of Rs. 7.89 crore and allocated Rs. 4.5 crore in 2008. Of the allocation, Rs. 2.5 crore was handed over to the Kannur Collector and Rs. 2 crore to the Wayanad Collector.\nThough land acquisition in Kannur is almost over, the work in Wayanad did not begin owing to apathy of revenue officials and lack of coordination between departments. According to the revised estimate of the Forest Department, Rs. 60.46 crore is needed for the completion of the project.\nThe Revenue Additional Chief Secretary wrote a letter to the Wayanad Collector recently directing him to ask the North Wayanad Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) to submit the required requisition under the new Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement (LARR) Act for completing the project.\nStudies by the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Bengaluru, Forest Research Institute, Peechi, and the French Institute, Puducherry, had recommended restoration of the elephant corridors as a permanent solution to the human-wildlife conflicts and maintaining viability of elephant habitats.\nThe studies suggested revival of the Pakramthalam-Periya, Periya-Kottiyur, Nilambur-Gudallur, Thirunelli-Kuddrakode, and South Wayanad-Malabar sanctuary elephant corridors in the Wayanad region.\nThe Forest Department had given priority to the Periya-Kottiyur corridor, which connects the North Wayanad Forest Division and the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary. The plan is to acquire 131.5 hectares -- 36.5 hectares in Kannur and 95 hectares in Wayanad -- for the corridor in five phases relocating 205 families -- 148 in Wayanad and 57 in Kannur.\nK.C. Prasad, DFO, North Wayanad, told The Hindu that he had received a directive from the district administration and requested the officials concerned to convene a public meeting to expedite the project.\n'

S' Image courtesy: iitm.ac.in \nChennai: The entrance examination for the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will go\n completely online from 2018 to make logistics and evaluations easier, the Joint Admission Board (JAB) decided.\n The JAB, which is the policy-making body on IIT admissions, took the decision at a meeting here on Sunday.\n In the online mode, students will take up the examination at designated centres where they need to answer the questions on a computer instead of using pen and paper.\n At present optical mark reading (OMR) sheets are used which need to be filled using pen or pencils and are evaluated by machines.\n In a statement, Director, IIT-Madras, and Chairman JAB 2017, Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi said, "It has been decided that he JEE (Advanced) will be conducted in online mode from 2018 onwards. Further information regarding the examination will be provided by the JAB in due course."\n The Ministry of Human Resource Development had earlier introduced the option of taking the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains online.\n The JEE-Mains is the entrance examination for admission to engineering courses offered across the country and a qualifying exam for JEE-Advanced which is required for admission to the prestigious IITs and NITs.\n "In order to make logistics and evaluations easier it was decided today that the JEE-Advanced should be made online," a JAB member said.\n "The concept was being discussed for many years, but it was necessary to have adequate infrastructure to conduct the exam online," the member added.\n More than 13 lakh students took the JEE-Mains this year, with less than 10 per cent of them going online. Around 2.2 lakh students were eligible to write the JEE (Advanced). \n'

S'The United States and South Korean began long-planned joint military exercises on Monday, heightening tensions with North Korea which called the drills a "reckless" step toward nuclear conflict. \nA report Pyongyang has earned millions of dollars in exports seemed likely, meanwhile, to raise doubts about the impact of sanctions to pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the joint drills, called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, were purely defensive and did not aim to increase tension on the peninsula, but North Korea denounced them as a rehersal for war. \n"There is no intent at all to heighten military tension on the Korean peninsula as these drills are held annually and are of a defensive nature," Moon told cabinet ministers. \n"North Korea should not exaggerate our efforts to keep peace nor should they engage in provocations that would worsen the situation, using (the exercise) as an excuse," he said. \nThe joint U.S.-South Korean drills last until Aug. 31 and involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea. \nThe United States also describes them as "defensive in nature", a term North Korean state media has dismissed as a "deceptive mask". \n"It\'s to prepare if something big were to occur and we needed to protect ROK," said Michelle Thomas, a U.S. military spokeswoman, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea. \nNorth Korea views such exercises as preparations for invasion and has fired missiles and taken other actions to show its anger over military drills in the past. \n"This is aimed to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula at any cost," the North\'s KCNA news agency said. \n"The situation on the Korean peninsula has plunged into a critical phase due to the reckless north-targeted war racket of the war maniacs." \nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war after the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. \nNorth Korea\'s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fueled a surge in regional tension and U.N.-led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change its behavior. \nChina, North Korea\'s main ally and trading partner, has urged the United States and South Korea to scrap the exercises. Russia has also asked for the drills to stop but the United States has not backed down. \nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said North and South Korea and the United States all needed to make more effort to ease tension. \n"We think that South Korea and the United States holding joint drills is not beneficial to easing current tensions or efforts by all sides to promote talks," she told a daily news briefing. \nSANCTIONS UNDERMINED \nA confidential United Nations report, seen by Reuters on Monday, found North Korea evaded U.N. sanctions by "deliberately using indirect channels" to export banned commodities and had generated $270 million between October 2016 and May 2017. \nThe "lax enforcement" of existing sanctions and Pyongyang\'s "evolving evasion techniques" were undermining the U.N. goal of getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, according to the report by independent U.N. experts who monitor sanctions violations for the U.N. Security Council. \nThe Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Aug. 5 that could slash its $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. The latest sanctions were imposed after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. \nU.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea this month it would face "fire and fury" if it threatens the United States. \nThe North responded by threatening to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off while it waited to see what the United States would do next. \nThere will be no field training during the current exercise, according to U.S. Forces Korea. \nThe United States has about 28,000 troops in South Korea. About 17,500 U.S. service members are participating in the exercise this month, down from 25,000 last year, according to the Pentagon. \nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday the reduction in the number of U.S. troops taking part reflected a need for fewer personnel and was not because of tension with North Korea. \nOther South Korean allies are also joining this year, with troops from Australia, Britain, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand taking part.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S' High-quality storytelling, laced with smart wit, works wonders and start-up brands can grow word-of-mouth! \nIndia, a hotbed of opportunities this decade, has been going through tectonic shifts at the intersection of consumerism and entrepreneurship, evoking behavioural patterns that are more than interesting to observe, and problems ever so enticing to solve.\nThe digital space continues to grow in foootprint, and tech-led companies continue to endeavor to build meaningful business. Yet, 98% of trade happens offline.\nStart-ups built on the base of powerful brands and robust business models go on to become large organizations. While the future of entrepreneurship seems somewhat bright, start-ups across sizes continue to crumble left, right and center. Building a real business needs profitability focus and customer money prioritization.\nBut for building a brand, the journey needs to be reverse-engineered to Heart > Mind > Wallet. And to get to that wallet attempting survival in a rat-race, the conversation becomes transactional. However, brands take time to build stickiness, grab mindshare and earn loyalty.\nA new category of modernized brands is taking form and sizeable shape. Navigating through all this chaos, as an entrepreneur, what should you focus on \xe2\x80\x94 with your heart in the brand and head in the business? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick primer.\n1. Storytelling, a highly impactful tool, spans far beyond television advertising\nOne common thread between many successful brands in the past has been storytelling and building an emotional connect- that makes people remember iconic advertisements, lightyears later. Today, in the transaction-focused marketing in the start-up world, often there is a wall between consumers and businesses- where consumers are trying to decode what the brand is trying to sell, and brands end up translucent to earn revenue. Bummer! For brand entrepreneurs, storytelling needs to move beyond traditional television advertising, to re-telling how salespeople can sell, to what digital communication could take shape (Insta-stories are the next big thing to take over!),and into store layout and design). High quality storytelling, laced with smart wit, works wonders and startup brands can (and should) grow word-of-mouth!\n2. Finding your own answer to the Online-offline intersection\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a no-brainer that generating more storefronts would generate more revenue and customers - and that increases your probability of success. Yet, consumer is fundamentally discovering brands and making shopping decisions online.\nHow should you straddle both channels? Some brands focus on belting out their own stores while some grow retail presence through multi-brand outlets.\nIn choosing a retail-first approach, we realized that consumer would discover the brand online, the first purchase would happen offline given category dynamics and price, and then repeat purchase happens online again: the classic O2O2O. Question to answer for online-led brand entrepreneurs is when to go offline, and how to make that happen while the traditional brick-and-mortar world tries to deal with the converse.\nChannels are colliding as consumers continue to desire deeper omni-channel integration.\n3. Pattern-recognize where the world will head to, and move there fast \nDining out used to be a once-a-quarter affair with family only a decade ago. Today, look what has happened to the industry as a result of what happened to the consumer. You could argue vice-versa, but it all started with Zomato recognizing what was going to happen to both segments. Many industries have this allegory. As purely function-led purchase becomes pass\xc3\xa9 from a brand communication standpoint, and fast fashion led e-commerce businesses are wondering how to crack consumer loyalty, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nWe recognized that consumers are starting to care about what their brand image would be, with what eyewear they sport. Also, observed similar patterns with social media behavior \xe2\x80\x94 the smart purchase mentality starting to trump the big-brand showoff mentality.\nAnd recognizing these have led to business decisions around what we do with our stores, and website, and brand communication. Pattern Recognition and Forecasting is key! For us, it has been realizing that personal branding is taking over.\n4. Marketing is getting innovative, new-age, and more quantitative than ever \nPeople love great pictures of themselves- especially if the pictures are polaroid- was one hypothesis statement. One year ago, we bought a Polaroid camera at our stores, and handed out a great picture to everyone who shopped. Today a whopping 28% of our walk-ins were driven by that polaroid picture referral with no inherent referral built in there\xe2\x80\x9d. A passcode only establishment becomes most sought after hangout spot in Delhi, while many competitors kept flashing discounts. Innovation has its own charm- do it, and do it well.\n5. Build the right team and craft the right culture: It has amazed me how powerful can it be to instill a sense of purpose rather than showering perks. While raw intelligence is needed in copious amounts for startups and brands to succeed, EQ goes a long way over IQ in creating impact. Balancing merit over age, influence over authority, attitude over technical prowess- all play an important role as brands/businesses start resonating the personality of high-impact early stage teams. Want to know when to realize you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it right? When you don\xe2\x80\x99t instill attendances and leave policies and have to never check on your team, and yet be surprised with non-requested working weekends and 2am emails and once in a while, them checking in on you JWhen you can take holidays- and come back shell-shocked with quality and quantity of output!\n6. Pricing is Critical: Businesses make or break, gain or lose market share, on price architecture. Some whitespaces are good, some not so much. After having figured out if value based (what your consumer could be willing to pay) or a cost-plus approach (how much markup should you make on your product) works for your start-up, price-communication becomes critical. We moved five price points to two flat price, re-nomenclatured a 3,999 price to 4,000, and labeled that price communication- all for simplicity and transparency.\nIncreased conversion rate by 12 percentage points, order volume by 25% and revenue by a solid 20%- all on a fairly large base, and all within a quarter.\nRazor-sharp focus Frugality, and innovative cost-sharing approaches make the backbone of organizations.

S'New Delhi, Aug 21 (IANS) Not lovin\xe2\x80\x99 it, say Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s foodies. Students, professionals and even the retired patrons of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s on Monday expressed sadness and disappointment over the upcoming shutdown of its 169 outlets across north and east India, including the remaining dozen in the capital.\nThe US firm earlier in the day announced termination of the franchisee agreement between its India arm McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s India Private Ltd (MIPL) and Vikram Bakshi-headed Connaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd (CPRL), effectively shutting down all 169 McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s outlets in northern and eastern India after a fortnight.\nMcDonald\xe2\x80\x99s India said it was scouting for a new partner to re-establish a profitable business in the region but the uncertainty about when new outlets would carry over made people blue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are saying that within fortnight these existing outlets will disappear. Will McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s be able to find a new partner in a span of 15 days? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad that they are closing down,\xe2\x80\x9d a student from Indraprastha University told IANS. \nAnkita Vazirani from Janakpuri said: \xe2\x80\x9cShutting down of Mcdonald\xe2\x80\x99s outlets due to license issue was shocking for all the burger lovers.\xe2\x80\x9d \nShe found it peculiar that the global food chain was closing down its outlets due to non-renewal of mandatory health regulatory license and a legal battle. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI still see some hope in the commitment by Mcdonald\xe2\x80\x99s of signing a new partner. It will not happen soon of course but eventually, things would be settled,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would not like to bear such a heavy loss in the Indian market.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThose affected by the announcement are mostly students as they place trust in the fast food chain for its ambience, quality and reasonable prices. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe come to McD (McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s) to chill. At times, we work on our projects alongside burgers and cold drinks. The best part about McD is the atmosphere as the staff is cooperative,\xe2\x80\x9d said 24-year-old Neetu Verma. \nMuskan Anwar, a first year student from Zakir Hussain College, shared her memories from when she was in school and how she and her friends would organise their birthday parties at the restaurant.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI and my friends see McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s as the best option to hang out. I absolutely love the combination of McSpicy Paneer burger with the McFlurry\xe2\x80\xa6 will miss these till the time new outlets are re-opened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nForty-three of the 55 McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s outlets in Delhi were shut down on June 29, due to a tussle between the north Indian franchisee and the global food giant.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is everywhere\xe2\x80\xa6 in every market, in every mall and other areas across the city. Rates are quite reasonable too,\xe2\x80\x9d 21-year-old Antra Fuloria said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel so sad when many outlets in the city are already shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnmol Agrawal, 22, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMcD is our only hope in the end of every month when we wish to eat out. It can\xe2\x80\x99t just shut down like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no other outlets where we can find such amazing combos within our budget.\xe2\x80\x9d \nFor 27-year-old Rajiv Giri, McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s has revolutionised the fast food industry. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are very few fast food chains that can match the quality, taste and value for money which McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s delivers. As a patron, I will surely miss my regular soft serves and French fries,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nFor P.N. Sidana, who retired years ago, the Connaught Place outlet holds many memories. He would visit the store with his friends to eat and chit-chat and said he loves their coffee and veg burgers the most.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will miss the place. These outlets must reopen soon. Who takes up the franchisee is not our concern. Even if McD doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back to the same spaces, we will be fine. Just that the quality should remain the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sidana.\n\xe2\x80\x93IANS\nmg/him/vd\n Post Source: Ians feed\n'

S'If you are an Indian, regardless of the kind of a societal background you come from, you would surely be able to vouch for the fact that India is a land of hundreds of traditions and beliefs, right?\nAs it is rightly termed, the "subcontinent", India is a country which houses a whole array of different cultural backgrounds, religions, castes and sub-castes, so one can imagine how many traditions are born out of all these different cultural backgrounds.\nEvery state is culturally different from the other and has its own set of traditions that are still being followed to this day.\nFor example, most states celebrate the beginning of the new year differently and even at different times of the year.\nWhile the new year is celebrated as \'Ugadi\' in Karnataka, it is called \'Pongal\' in Tamil Nadu, and the rituals involved in the celebrations can be very different.\nNow, with traditions come a number of beliefs too and while some beliefs have a solid basis that pertain to the health and well-being of a person, the others may simply be meaningless.\nFor example, many families in India still believe that only women who give birth to male children can attain a place in heaven; this belief has no basis and could be a pure myth.\nOther beliefs such as a woman having to wash her hair on the third day for her period, could have some scientific evidence. A woman\'s body produces a lot of sweat and oil during the menstrual cycle, so a hair-wash nearing the end of the cycle could be a hygienic practice!\nNow, even when it comes to certain natural phenomenon such as the full moon, eclipse, etc., people in India have certain beliefs.\nMany people here say that one must not consume any food or go out, during a solar eclipse.\nLet us now find out some of the reasons why many Indians do not consume food during an eclipse.\nReason #1: Radiations May Cause Health-hazards\n As we know, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the sun and the earth, partially obscuring the sun from the earth, until it lasts. Astronomers and scientists alike, believe that during an eclipse, certain radiations reach the earth through the atmosphere, and these radiations may lead to the health-hazardous bacteria in the food to multiply faster.\nSo, this could be one reason why Indians do not consume food when there is an active eclipse.\nReason #2 Can Cause Indigestion\n Yet another reason why many Indians do not consume food until an eclipse is over is because of the fact that the radiations which fall on the earth during the eclipse can interfere with a healthy digestion.\nA number of research studies have been conducted on this subject and scientists claim that consuming food during an eclipse could cause indigestion.\nThere have also been a few studies in which experts claim that foods which have been exposed to direct radiations from the eclipse could also be potentially toxic!\nSo, there are some of the reasons why a lot of Indians do not consume food during an eclipse.\n'

S'A new learning strategy could be the end grades as we know it. But the individualized learning could make this revolutionary way to teach better for students.\n From New York to Vermont, and from Illinois to Idaho, a new kind of education standard is taking root. It\'s called mastery-based learning, and it means no grades. That\'s right; no A\'s, B\'s or C\'s. Instead, students focus on grade-appropriate skills competency. As in, being able to solve a certain type of math problem, or read at a certain level, or construct a thesis. Once they get it, they move on. Otherwise, they continue to focus on that particular set of skills.\nAccording to The New York Times, in some regions, like New York City, elementary, middle and high schools are adopting this type of skills-based evaluation system voluntarily, while in others, states have mandated that these changes take place. And obviously, some parents and educators are all for abolishing grades, while others have met such a massive overhaul to education with much resistance.\nUnderstandably, some parents worry that mastery-based learning will adversely affect their kids. Does it put children at a disadvantage for when they go out into the real world, where concrete results rule? Is it just another example of the "everyone gets a trophy" mentality that marks a major departure from how you and I grew up?\nBut for every doubter, there is a believer. Some swear that learning based on mastery instead of grades, or a "one size fits all" approach to teaching, has changed kids\' lives. It makes sense that when kids are allowed to learn at their own pace, they can thrive. Not having to learn something just to get that "A" also takes the pressure off, which may also help foster favorable conditions for learning. And it\'s true that kids are still being graded in some way, but on specific skills instead of entire subjects, just lumped together.\nWant the latest parenting news? Sign up for our Parents Daily newsletter.\nSo-called competency-based learning, which relies on small-group sessions and online learning tools to help kids learn their way, is still in the testing stages at many schools across the country. But could it be coming to a school near you? And how would you feel about saying bye-bye to grades for your kiddo?\n'

S'Swim or sink? Impact of a rate cut on the rupee is uncertain\nNot necessarily. It depends on rate of inflation, equity flows, monetary policy spillovers and politics, among other factors\n In recent times, the Reserve Bank of India and its leaders have risen to celebrity status in India. Former governor Raghuram Rajan was the first to receive titles like \xe2\x80\x98Rockstar\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Bond of Mint Street\xe2\x80\x99 in India\xe2\x80\x99s public discourse. He too seemed to acknowledge the accolades in a monetary policy press conference, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am Raghuram Rajan and I do what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Whether a rate cut is expected or not, there is always a huge buzz around RBI\xe2\x80\x99s monetary policy announcements, and the recent one was no exception. \nPredictable confusion\n On August 2, 2017, the RBI cut the policy repo rate by 25 bps (1 percentage point is 100 bps) to 6 per cent, amid building pressure from different stakeholders as headline inflation dropped to a historic low of 1.54 per cent in June 2017. From the constant chatter on mainstream and social media, I observed that commentators seemed perplexed about one question, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the RBI is cutting interest rates, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that lead to depreciation of the Indian rupee?\xe2\x80\x9d \n The confusion of course emerges from a well-known theory in neoclassical international finance called the \xe2\x80\x98uncovered interest rate parity\xe2\x80\x99 (UIP). The UIP aims to predict the spot exchange rate of a small open economy with a fully-floating currency. It states that the expected change in the exchange rate between two countries\xe2\x80\x99 currencies should equal the difference between interest rates in those countries. According to the UIP, an interest rate cut makes the home country\xe2\x80\x99s fixed income securities less attractive and capital flows out of the country, depreciating the home currency. \n Many market participants assume that the UIP holds, and that too at all times. For those observers, exchange rate movements around the rate cut must\xe2\x80\x99ve been severely confusing. In spite of most analysts predicting a rate cut on August 2, the rupee appreciated against the dollar by 0.4 per cent from morning till 2 pm, with the exchange rate reaching a 3.5-month low. Just before the announcement, a senior research analyst at Bloomberg Quint said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf an interest rate cut comes in, it will be taken negatively for the rupee, we could see some depreciation, because the interest rate differential between INR and USD narrows.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an obvious reference to the UIP. However, after the announcement at 2.30 pm, the rupee appreciated by a further 0.3 per cent, making it a 0.7 per cent appreciation in a single day. \nSome explanations\n A few factors can explain this conundrum. For one, there is a simple mistake in understanding the variables of the UIP. The UIP is a relationship between real exchange rate and real interest rate differential, not nominal rates. Real rates are nominal rates adjusted for inflation. Since inflation in India has decreased significantly over the past few months, the real interest rate has actually risen and a 25-bps rate cut is not enough to offset the impact of a crash in inflation. In fact, at 4.5 per cent, India has the highest real interest rate in Asia by a margin, with China in second place at 3 per cent. \n To solve the conundrum completely, we need to understand certain limitations of the UIP model. First, the UIP assumes that the exchange rate is driven purely by fixed income flows via carry trades and completely ignores equity flows. However, equity inflows have become significant, accounting for 38 per cent of total net purchases by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in India over the last 12 months. In such an environment, a model which only looks at fixed income flows may not give a correct answer. \n Second, the UIP ignores the fact that the international monetary system is hierarchical, with the dollar as the global reserve currency. In the post-Bretton Woods system, the US is the \xe2\x80\x98centre\xe2\x80\x99 country with certain structural advantages and India is a \xe2\x80\x98peripheral\xe2\x80\x99 country. Thus, US monetary policy decisions spill over to India in the form of capital flows. However, US monetary policy uncertainty, one of the reasons for a weak dollar right now (and hence appreciating rupee), is outside the scope of the UIP. \n Third is the impact of political factors. The UIP assumes that in countries with flexible exchange rates and no capital controls, political developments do not affect the exchange rate. However, another important reason for the ongoing weakness in the dollar is the Trump administration and its policies. In line with the \xe2\x80\x98America First\xe2\x80\x99 policy, in early 2017 President Trump signalled that he preferred a weak dollar because it would aid American companies sell products abroad. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar has weakened by around 6.6 per cent against the rupee. In a recent article titled \xe2\x80\x98Political drama is hitting the dollar hard\xe2\x80\x99, Bloomberg reports, \xe2\x80\x9cThe relationship (between politics and exchange rate) has grown stronger in an era of quantitative easing, which has distorted the bond and stock markets. Hence, currency traders are more attuned to political developments.\xe2\x80\x9d \nCritical assumptions\n All models in the social sciences are developed with certain assumptions in the background. Some assumptions are more important than others because their violation significantly changes the results of the model. Addressing the issue in his book, Economics Rules, Harvard economist Dani Rodrik calls them \xe2\x80\x9ccritical assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d. It is important to remember that reliable conclusions can be derived from models only when the critical assumptions approximate reality. When they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we should look for models which make assumptions better suited for the context. \n What, then, is the correct answer to the question, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes a rate cut lead to currency depreciation?\xe2\x80\x9d It depends \xe2\x80\x94 on equity inflows, capital flows driven by monetary policy of the \xe2\x80\x98centre\xe2\x80\x99 country and political developments, among other factors. When these factors dominate, it is not a good idea to rely completely on the UIP for the answer. As Dani Rodrik says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe correct answer to almost any question in economics is: It depends. Different models, each equally respectable, provide different answers.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

S"Hyundai India will launch the new Verna on 22nd August 2017 and the pre-booking is already open at Rs 25,000. The car will sport new features, design and improved comfort and convenience.\nHyundai is all set to launch the 2017 Verna in India tomorrow that will compete with the likes of the Honda City, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, Volkswagen Vento and the Skoda Rapid in its segment. The new Hyundai Verna is based on Hyundai's new K2 platform \xe2\x80\x98super body structure\xe2\x80\x99 that makes use of 50 percent advanced high-strength steel. This, in turn, improves the performance of the vehicle and also enhances the safety as the new chassis has undergone structural changes making the car safer. The fifth generation Verna is powered by a 1.6 litre petrol and 1.6 litre diesel engine that is paired to both six-speed automatic and a six-speed manual transmission. The 1.6 litre Dual VTVT petrol engine develops 120 hp of power, while the 1.6 litre U2 CRDi VGT diesel unit generates 123 hp.\nThe carmaker has also increased the dimensions of the sedan in order to offer more space at the rear. This has been done by increasing the length, width and headroom of the car.\nSegment-first features on the new Hyundai Verna include front-ventilated seats, rear curtains and eco coating that helps to control and eliminate the foul smell from the cabin and keeps it fresh. These features are available on the higher variants along with six airbags and rear parking sensors and camera. The car also gets rear A/C vents and an updated 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with voice recognition and navigation.\nThe automaker has also equipped the 2017 Verna with Hands-free boot lid, which the company calls it hands-free smart trunk that allows passengers or the drivers to easily open the boot by just standing close to the boot. The car gets the same Fluidic design language similar to the Hyundai Elantra. The exterior features an electric sunroof, a cascade design front grille, projector headlamps, fog lamps with LED DRLs (Daytime Running Lamps) and LED tail lamps.\nThe car manufacturer has already started accepting pre-bookings for the upcoming sedan at Rs 25,000 across its dealership. Globally, over 8.8 million Hyundai Verna sedans have been sold in about 66 countries and the company has sold about 3.17 lakh units in India.\n"

S'Cheim & Read will be participating in Frieze Masters London 2017. \nCheim & Read was founded in 1997 by John Cheim and Howard Read. The gallery represents important international contemporary and historical artists. The gallery will be presenting a survey of important works by Lynda Benglis at Frieze Masters London 2017. In the late 1960s, Benglis rejected the formalist precepts of Clement Greenberg and Donald Judd to produce a form of Post-minimalism paralleling Eva Hesse\xe2\x80\x99s investigations into the emotional resonances of materials, but with an explicit sense of sexuality and Feminist revolt coupled with a freewheeling manipulation of media, from painting and sculpture to photography, film, and video.

S'Mumbai: Looking at the steady increase in tourists arrivals from India, Israel is eyeing one lakh Indian travellers to visit the country by the next year. "We have been very focused in tourism promotions in India and easing the visa process. This year in the first seven months till July we have already hosted 34,000 Indian tourists. This is expected to go up to 55,000 by the end of this year," Israel Ministry of Tourism India Director Hassan Madah told PTI here.\nIn Pic: Hassan Madah (Source: twitter@madah22)\nHe said, currently there are 3-4 direct flights from Mumbai to Tel Aviv and numerous connecting flights from the Middle East. There are talks of introducing direct Air India flights connecting New Delhi with Israel in a few months, he said adding if it commences then the tourist traffic is likely to surge from India and the the number this year may reach nearly 90,000.\n There are few global airlines, who are waiting for the Air India flights to be launched, and then introduce their fleets in this direct route. "When this happens, we will see a surge in tourists arrivals from India. We have also been engaging with the tourism industry in India since last few years and are focused in many promotional activities. Due to this we have set a target of reaching one lakh tourists from India by the end of 2018," he said.\n For tourism promotions in India, Israel Ministry of Tourism (IMOT) is spending USD 5-6 million in India this year, he said adding going forward as the tourist traffic grows the Budget is likely to grow. Israel, which has positioned its self as an affordable premium destination, is targeting travellers mainly for pilgrimage, leisure and meetings, incentives, conferences, events (MICE), including weddings, segments.\n "We are mainly focusing on pilgrimage, leisure and MICE as they are huge segments in India. However, we also have scope for the young adventurer at heart, honeymoon and for medical purposes," he said.\n In India, IMOT is targeting people from the metro cities mostly from over 25 years who are well travelled. "Initially, we want to focus in the big and metro cities. Gradually, we will expand our promotions to tier II and III cities," he added.\n Madah said initially in Asia, India was the number one source market for Israel, however, China has now taken over the position.\n "We believe that after the connectivity improves, India will again become number one source market for us among the Asian countries," he said.\n Globally, the US and Europe, including Russia are the top source markets of Israel. \n'

S' Summary: \nNowadays all over the world, so many people are suffering from the mental health problems especially the depression. But maximum of them feel ashamed of talking about this and to see a doctor. We discussed the issue with Dr. Parul Adlakha and Ms. Samridhi Khatri.\nMental health is an all- encompassing term that includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects our thought, emotions and behavior. Our Mental health determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.\nBio-Psycho-Social factors contribute to mental health problems, these include:\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Family history of mental health problems\n Good mental health is characterized by a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to cope with and manage change and uncertainty along with feel, express and manage a range of positive and negative emotions, and to maintain good relationships with others.\nIn this regard, we talked with the co-founder and Clinical psychologist of P.E.A.C.E. solutions Dr. Parul Adlakha. She told us that according to some research the lifetime prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder is 10\xe2\x80\x9325% for women, and 5\xe2\x80\x9312% for men.\nMs. Samridhi Khatri also co-founder of P.E.A.C.E. solutions and clinical psychologist says that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is also the most important factor for suicide and will be the second cause of Global Disease Burden by the year 2020. In India, the prevalence of depression is 9%, and the average age of onset of depression is 31.9 years.\nMental health is a part of the overall well-being of a person and bringing this perspective to the fore the WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION celebrated the World Health Day on 7th April 2017 by talking about Depression.\nSymptoms and causes of depression-\nWe all have times when our mood is low, and we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling sad or miserable about life. Usually, these feelings pass in due course. But if the feelings are interfering with your life and don`t go away after a couple of weeks, or if they come back over and over again for a few days at a time, it could be depression.\nWhen a person suffers from depression, it interferes with daily life and normal functioning. It can cause pain for both the person with depression and those who care about him or her. It is a real illness and not a sign of a person\xe2\x80\x99s weakness or a character flaw.\nSadness is only a small part of depression. Depression has many other symptoms, including physical ones. Some core symptoms are:\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, worthlessness, helplessness\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Decreased energy, being \xe2\x80\x9cslowed down\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Difficulty concentrating and making decisions\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping\n\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x9a\xc2\xb7 Appetite and/or weight changes\nIn many cases, depression can be triggered by an unwelcome, stressful or traumatic event. This could be a loss of employment, the end of a relationship, loss of loved one, major life changes, like changing job, moving house or getting married, being physically or sexually assaulted, being bullied or abused.\nExperiencing depression can make it hard to find enthusiasm in life. But taking an active role, and taking steps to help yourself cope with your experiences, can make a big difference to how you feel. It is a manageable condition. Managing depression requires a treatment plan, and a team of experts to put that plan to work. A small but important step towards well-being involves expressing oneself and talking about our mental health issues.\nAlso See---\nSource: NYOOOZ\n'

S'A 24-year-old man, who was racing two of his friends on his sports bike, died on Tuesday after he slammed into a wall near the Mandi House metro station in central Delhi after losing control of the two-wheeler. \nThe entire race and the horrific accident was captured by the helmet camera that one of his friends riding just behind him was wearing. \nThe incident took place Monday night when Himanshu Bansal, Gazi and Lakshya were returning from Connaught Place after a party. The trio were racing their bikes, police said on Tuesday. \nHimanshu was riding a Benelli TNT 600i and was ahead of his friend, who had the action camera mounted on his helmet. He was racing a 300cc motorcycle, Kawasaki Ninja 300. The third motorcycle in the race was also a Benelli TNT 600i, a 600cc bike. \nWhen Himanshu reached near Mandi House Metro Station, his motorcycle was about to hit an elderly man crossing the road, police said.\nIn order to avert the accident, he applied brakes but lost control of the vehicle and was thrown off. He hit the wall of Lady Irwin College, they said. \nThe footage shows Himanshu and his friends overtaking speeding vehicles on the busy roads at times. The severity of the impact can be estimated from the distance to which Himanshu was thrown off after the accident was the amount of blood lying several feet away from his body. \nHimanshu, a resident of Vivek Vihar, was declared brought dead by doctors, police added.\n'

S'A 30-year-old woman registered an FIR on Friday, stating that six men raped her near the Badshahpur village in Gurugram on July 23, while she was on way to her home in the village after work. She decided to approach the police after the accused repeatedly raped her afterwards as well, while warning her against disclosing the ordeal to anybody.\nIn her statement, the woman said that on the day of the incident, three of the accused grabbed her and forcibly took her to a room. Three more men were already present there. All six took turns to rape her. They also threatened her, following which she decided to keep silent and did not even tell her husband about the crime.\nShe further stated that the six men kept abusing her on different occasions and so, she finally decided to approach the police. "We are very poor. I have two children. I feared that they might harm, so I did not approach the police at first," the woman said.\n"Both the woman and her husband work as labourers," Sub-Inspector Manju Shah said.\nAn FIR was registered against the six accused under Sections 376D (case of gang rape, where each of those persons shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years) and 506 (the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term that may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n"The woman was sent for medical examination and rape was confirmed. Further investigation is on. We are trying our best to arrest the accused," Inspector Kailash Yadav said.\n'

S"It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to decide what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do in the future. I feel lost!\nDear Lauren,\nIt's nearly time for me to decide what I would like to do in the future but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I want. I cannot stop thinking about it and asking advice from family, friends and people that I trust\xe2\x80\xa6except that only makes me more confused! I feel really lost.\nLauren Roth's Answer\nI commend you for thinking about your future! Trying to plan out your life is a very responsible thing to do, and you should be proud of yourself for being mature, responsible, and goal-oriented. So many people just float through their relationships, their jobs, their lives. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll start to feel less \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d if you stop for a moment and consider the value in your deliberations.\nThat being said, it is no fun to feel lost. So here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about your future: you probably have many, many options which would each be \xe2\x80\x9cthe right thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Assuming you\xe2\x80\x99re not considering becoming a professional thief, a professional gambler, or a professional drunk, I have a feeling many of the options you\xe2\x80\x99re considering would probably work for your life. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you\xe2\x80\x99re deciding: lawyer or physical therapist? Doctor or teacher? Stay-at-home-parent or business executive? Even though some of those are diametrically opposed to each other, you could possibly find fulfillment of different kinds in each of them.\nAsk people you trust\xe2\x80\x94friends, mentors, parents, alumni from your college or seminary, teachers, principals, adults in different professions\xe2\x80\x94a few important questions. (You should also research these questions online.)\nFor every profession they know about, 1. What are the work hours required for that job? How many hours per week are standard for work within that profession, and at what times of the day?\n2. How long is the training period for that profession? For example, doctors have a long haul. Lawyers have a shorter period of schooling. Therapists have a slightly shorter school trajectory. Some businesses you can learn while on the job, already earning money. Artists, musicians, and writers can go through training or they can just try their hand and see if their craft is discovered and appreciated. Then you consider: are you a person who enjoys school? Are you a person who is willing to study for long hours, for many years? Or are you someone who might prefer learning while working?\n3. What is the average income for a person of that profession? What is the range of incomes for people of that profession? Does the income justify the cost of schooling and training? How much debt will you incur through the schooling? How much risk is there regarding income? Is there a steady, predetermined income? Some professions give a low base salary, and additional income depends on how many clients you recruit or how many items you sell. Are you someone who wants a steady, predetermined salary? Or are you someone who likes the thrill of trying to make more money if you can, but can tolerate the risk of losing money, too? Many business ventures can be very lucrative, but can also involve high risks of losing money. Then you have to consider: how much do material things mean to you? How much does money mean to you, and how much will it mean to you in the future?\n4. What is their opinion of that profession? What do they think are the pros and cons of that profession, and why? What are they basing their opinion on? Were they in that profession? Did they have family members or close friends in that profession? What do they think might be the future utility and relevance of that profession?\n5. Is it a job that can be done anywhere, or would you need to be in a particular locale?\nAfter asking as many wise and trusted people as you can those questions about any professions they are familiar with, then it\xe2\x80\x99s time to assess rationally what makes the most sense for your life. If you want to be a hands-on parent, it might not be smart to pursue a career as a travelling salesperson. If you want to have lots of free time, it might not be smart to pursue a career as a physician. If you are someone who enjoys creative thinking, you might not want to become a CPA, unless you can also practice your creative thinking in some other way in your life. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t love kids, you might not want to become a schoolteacher.\nOnce you hear and read about the particulars of different careers, and once you\xe2\x80\x99ve assessed rationally what makes the most sense for your life, then get calm and centered and quiet and contemplative, and try to feel what your heart is telling you about each of the options. Try to tune in to what your gut feeling is. If certain career paths make you anxious but also really attract you, you might want to go for it. If thinking about certain career paths gives you a headache and make you feel dead inside, those probably aren\xe2\x80\x99t the paths you should pursue. Of course, if you start to feel really excited and alive and passionate about a certain job/career/profession, then that\xe2\x80\x99s probably the one you should run to!\nYou also might want to consider that you can do certain things as your job, and pursue the things you are passionate about as \xe2\x80\x9cextra-curricular activities.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a CPA by day in order to earn a steady income, and because you enjoy orderliness and math, but by night or on the weekends, you\xe2\x80\x99ll pursue your passion for woodworking or baking or photography or acting or mountain biking\xe2\x80\xa6. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll create beautiful works of art that you sell online, but also work in a chocolate factory or in a business office or become a dentist. Your passion and your career don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to dovetail, although it\xe2\x80\x99s always nice when they do.\nLast thought: there are many actions and courses of action we can take in our lives. Most courses of action are reversible. If you go into business and hate it, you can always become an artist instead, assuming you\xe2\x80\x99ve made enough money to live on. Or you can continue being a businessperson, but create art at night and on the weekends. If you become an artist but find yourself starving and homeless, you can always go to school to become a lawyer, assuming you can get student loans and you have a way to support yourself through school. If you become a therapist but decide you really prefer teaching, you can always switch. Often, the experiences you\xe2\x80\x99ve had on one career path enrich you as a person, and as a candidate for the next job.\nWhichever career path you choose, you will certainly learn valuable lessons along the way, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully enhance and enrich yourself, your family, your community, and the world.\n"

S"Even as the Cotton Advisory Board (CAB), in its latest second advanced estimate, predicted cotton production at 34.5 million bales (each of 170 kg), the pink bollworm menace is keeping farmers in Gujarat on tenterhooks. \nOf the overall cotton area of 26.5 million hectares across the State\xe2\x80\x99s 27 districts, it is estimated that 20 per cent of the acreage has been affected by the worm that damages the bolls of the cotton plant. However, experts do not yet see the need to press the panic button as the plantation is still at its initial stage and the pest can be contained with various conventional and non-conventional methods. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have advised farmers to install Pheromone Trap to contain the worm. Also, there are chemical and non-chemical ways to tackle this menace. We are advising them to follow the non-chemical ways, which are less costly and effective as well. Almost the entire Saurasthra region has seen sporadic presence of pink bollworm,\xe2\x80\x9d said L K Dhaduk, head of Cotton Research Station, Junagadh Agriculture University. \nBut Dhaduk warned that though the menace is \xe2\x80\x9cstill controllable, after a month, this opportunity will be lost... We call this stage a suicide stage of the pest.\xe2\x80\x9d \nCotton production faces another uncertainty, too, with farmers, however considering alternative crops after key growing regions faced severe flooding post last month\xe2\x80\x99s heavy rainfall. \xe2\x80\x9cFarmers whose cotton fields were damaged turned to castor and onion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramesh Bhorania, a farmer of Rajkot district. \nDespite reports of farmers switching to other crops, ginners are optimistic about cotton output. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that only a small section of farmers will turn to other crops. With increased availability of water and better soil moisture, there are chances of good yield. We don't see any major impact on supplies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anand Popat of Saurashtra Ginners Association. \nAs per CAB\xe2\x80\x99s latest estimates, the area under cotton has dropped 11 per cent to 10.84 million hectares over last year. But the yield is seen rising to 541 kg/ha from 459 kg. \n"

S"Find design inspiration in 15 walk-in showers that beautifully stretch a small bathroom's footprint, increase its functionality, and amplify its good looks.\nPopular In Shower & Baths\nEverything In This Slideshow\nExpand a small bathroom's utility by designing a walk-in shower that provides a solid wall or walls for placing vanities or tubs. Seemingly an extension of the bathroom's board-clad walls, this knee wall accommodates a shallow vanity with a mirrored door. White painted walls, the shower's glass enclosure and tiled walls, and reflective surfaces encourage light to move around the space, causing the small bathroom to appear roomier.\n2 of 16\n Capture a Corner \nSet a walk-in shower into a small bathroom's corner, but expand the showering area by opting for a neoangled base and glass enclosure that step into the main bath area. This walk-in shower's neoangled design expanded the shower's square footage, giving the homeowners space for adding a built-in bench.\n3 of 16\n Delight the Eye \nEven the smallest bathroom can accommodate bounteous style. Though diminutive in dimension, this walk-in shower makes an impact thanks to its marble door frame and tiled interior, which are highlighted by charcoal walls. Bathroom floor tiles repeat inside the shower to visually link the two areas.\n4 of 16\n Omit the Tub \nIf showering is your go-to bathing option, forget about adding a tub. Instead, use what would have been the tub wall to create a spacious walk-in shower. Stretching across a bathroom's rear (and shortest wall), this walk-in shower provides plenty of pampering without overwhelming the small bathroom. Continuing the bathroom's marble walls and tiled flooring into the shower composes a cohesive scene that creates the perception of a larger space.\n5 of 16\n Raise See-Through Walls \nEnclose a walk-in shower with a seamless glass enclosure. The transparent barriers take up little visual space and let natural light flow between the bathroom and shower, which in turn makes a small bathroom live larger than its dimensions. This bathroom's neutral tiled walls continue into the walk-in shower to further the space-stretching illusion.\n6 of 16\n Double Up \nWhen bathroom space is at a premium, consider placing bathing and showering stations within one enclosure. The homeowners tucked a small soaking tub inside the walk-in shower to maximize a minimal amount of floor space. Advantageously, the two-in-one design keeps splashing water and wet footprints away from commode and vanity areas.\n7 of 16\n Reach Beneath \nDesign a walk-in shower that takes advantage of your small bathroom's architectural oddities. Tucking a shower beneath an eave allowed these homeowners to fit a walk-in shower near light-inviting windows in their small bathroom. Another advantage: Adding the shower created an interior wall that accommodates a second vanity.\n8 of 16\n Tailor to Suit \nConsider other bathroom amenities when making way for a walk-in shower. Dressed with a simple glass door, this walk-in shower provides a solid wall for showcasing a freestanding tub. A transom window works with the door to carry light from nearby windows into the shower's interior.\n9 of 16\n Adapt and Adjust \nFurnish your small bathroom with downsized vanities or pedestal sinks to open up space for a walk-in shower. This shower is framed by shallow walls that create nichelike recesses that house two vanities. The shower's frosted-glass door, which stops a few feet below the ceiling, provides privacy without blocking light.\n10 of 16\n Get Creative \nRethink available bathroom space until you are able to fit in every one of your desired amenities. This small bathroom design tucks a bathtub between the windowed wall and a compact walk-in shower; the bath stretches behind the shower to supply a full-out bathing experience. The tub, shower, and vanity share the natural light streaming through the undressed window.\n11 of 16\n Fashion a Focal Point \nAdd a walk-in shower that enhances a small bathroom's usefulness and beauty. This shower stands out in a simply furnished bath, thanks to its distinctively tiled walls and river-rock-tiled floor that are easily seen through a frameless glass shower enclosure. The glass enclosure stair-steps up a marble frame, highlighting the shower bench and a toiletry shelf that aligns with the beaded-board wainscoting's upper trim.\n12 of 16\n Blur the Lines \nDesign a walk-in shower that blends into the background. Though this shower's seamless glass enclosure is visible, it fades in importance, thanks to brightly hued wainscoting that wraps the bathroom's lower walls. Without solid walls, the shower appears at one with its surroundings rather than as a separate room.\n13 of 16\n Go Long \nAlign bathing and showering stations on a small bathroom's longest wall. By placing the tub against the walk-in shower's knee wall, the homeowners created a compact arrangement that left the opposite wall open for other bathroom fittings. A shared palette of colors and materials furthers the connection between the shower and tub.\n14 of 16\n Simplify Forms \nAccommodate your getting-ready needs with downsized fixtures that don't take up too much floor space. This handsomely profiled pedestal sink and narrow toiletry ledge stylishly take the place of a more cumbersome vanity. The marble-tiled walls and ceiling elegantly elevate the simply furnished bathroom.\n15 of 16\n Invite in Light \nPosition your walk-in shower near a window or beneath a skylight so you can bask in sunbeams or gaze upon twinkling stars. This walk-in shower boasts a clerestory window and a glass door that allow natural light to flow in and out of the shower. Thanks to its placement, the shower becomes a separate room that doesn't clutter up the small bathroom's sight lines or impede traffic flow.\n16 of 16\n Bonus! Easy Small-Bath Updates \nTake your small bathroom from drab to fab with these easy, affordable updates.\n 16 of 16 \n  Next Slideshow  15 Stylish Seats for Walk-In Showers \n15 Stylish Seats for Walk-In Showers\nA shower seat, whether it is a built-in bench or a teak stool, expand a walk-in shower's purpose. Seats in walk-in showers keep toiletries at hand, provide a footrest for leg-shaving endeavors, and supply perches within reach of rejuvenating sprays. Take your furnishing cue from these 15 walk-in showers with stylish seats that invite bathers to sit down and unwind.\n Begin Slideshow \xc2\xbb \n"

S'August 21, 2017 will go down as the day when all of North America got to witness the sight of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s shadow pass directly in front of the Sun \xe2\x80\x93 a total solar eclipse.\nToday, the deepest part of the shadow, or umbra, cast by the moon will fall over a 70-mile-wide (113-km-wide), 2,500-mile-long (4,000-km-long) \xe2\x80\x98path of totality\xe2\x80\x99 traversing 14 states in the US. Millions of people who live there can view the eclipse at its fullest merely by walking outside and simply looking up.\nOver the course of 100 minutes, these states across the US will experience more than two minutes of darkness in the middle of the day. Additionally, a partial eclipse will be viewable across all of North America as well.\nSpectators and enthusiasts around the world will be flooded with images and videos, captured during the eclipse by 11 spacecraft, at least three NASA aircraft, more than 50 high-altitude balloons, and the astronauts aboard the International Space Station \xe2\x80\x93 each offering a magnificent point of view for the celestial event.\nThe eclipse begins its cross-country trajectory over the Pacific Coast of Oregon in late morning. It will reach South Carolina\'s Atlantic shore some 90 minutes later. The total eclipse of the sun is considered one of the most spell-binding phenomena in nature but it rarely occurs over a wide swath of land, let alone one of the world\'s most heavily populated countries at the height of summer.\nIn terms of audience potential, it is hard to top the United States, with its mobile and affluent population, even though the direct path is mostly over rural areas, towns and small cities. The largest is Nashville, Tennessee, a city of 609,000 residents.\nEven so, the advent of social media and inexpensive high-tech optics have boosted public awareness, assuring what many US experts predict will be unprecedented viewership for the so-called "Great American Eclipse."\nThere hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a total solar eclipse in the contiguous US since 1979. The next total solar eclipse won\'t happen in the US until April 8, 2024. Outside of the US, the next one will be visible in Chile and Argentina on July 2, 2019.\n'

S'Photo Credit: Thinkstock\nLast week saw Vishal Sikka resign from the board of Infosys \xe2\x80\x93 one of India\xe2\x80\x99s largest IT companies \xe2\x80\x93 after a prolonged clash between the company\xe2\x80\x99s initial promoters and the board over the firm\xe2\x80\x99s management policies. Not long before, we were privy to a similar issue with the Tata Group: Nusli Wadia, one of the Tata Group\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving independent directors and Cyrus Mistry, the first non-family chairman of Tata Sons, were ousted. Beneath the surface of these corporate wars, however, are the broader questions regarding Indian corporate governance, which conforms to the letter of the law, but falls short in spirit.\nA brief look at Indian corporate history will bring to the fore loopholes that have led to innumerable scams and governance failures, and reactionary legal changes introduced to tackle these deficiencies. However, even with multiple such checks in place, the situation appears as fragile as ever, with news of corporate governance failures having become a damning norm of the day. While challenges to corporate governance are as routine globally (think Enron) as they are domestically, and as grave in the unlisted space as they are in the listed, the scope of this article has been limited to the latter for the sake of brevity.\nAre recent issues a sign of weak Boards?\n As dynamic as corporate governance issues are, one thing that can be said with certainty is that the board of a company plays a very important role in making or breaking a company\xe2\x80\x99s governance. The events on the Tata and Infosys boards have revealed certain fractures \xe2\x80\x93 one, how independent is the institution of the independent director in promoter-driven companies? Two, how tolerant is a board of a company\xe2\x80\x99s management decision with regard to policies on remuneration or related-party transactions?\nSuffice to say that the removal of a director, including non-executive directors, from an Indian company requires only an ordinary resolution. While this power of the shareholders is an extension of the principle of shareholder democracy, it is questionable if its purpose is duly served. The Indian corporate landscape primarily consists largely of promoter-driven companies. In that, whether an ordinary resolution represents the will of all the shareholders uniformly is doubtful. In one recent instance, an independent director was removed from a board. In this case, the retail investors voted against the resolution for removal, but the promoters, who hold over 30% stake, voted in favor of the removal.\nFurther, in a company where the promoter finds it easy to muster 50% of votes on a resolution with relative ease (as is often the case), it is only reasonable to ask how an independent director can ensure integrity in his actions if his position on the board is subject to the collusion of a simple majority. If resolutions can be moved by a simple majority, what does that say about the independence of the board?\nThe other issue is the power of a board to challenge management policies, be it the severance packages of management executives, or more generally, the management\xe2\x80\x99s say in a company\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. Oftentimes, the same person heads the board as well as the management \xe2\x80\x93 a practice as local to newly found startups as it is to established corporate giants. It is here that questions on the strength of governance mechanisms emerge again. A strong management may override the board, especially in corporations where the same person heads both the offices.\nIs the Anglo-Saxon model fit for Indian companies?\n The Indian governance model is designed after the Anglo-Saxon model of governance. The voluntary code floated by the Confederation of Indian Industry in 1998 and the recommendations made by the Birla and Narayana Murthy Committees bear striking similarities to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Cadbury Report and other leading Anglo-Saxon corporate governance statutes.\nIn the Anglo-Saxon models, board directors dominate and shareholders serve as controllers. The model is designed primarily to reconcile the conflict between the two. But while this model works well for more developed western jurisdictions, it is, as can be seen, not the best suited for the Indian corporate climate.\nIn typical Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, corporate governance norms are aimed at disciplining the management and reducing the \xe2\x80\x98gap\xe2\x80\x99 between the management and dispersed shareholders. India, on the other hand, presents a more unique problem \xe2\x80\x93 the dominance of majority shareholders. Hence, perhaps the efforts towards corporate governance in India are aimed at the wrong gap. Secondly, Anglo-Saxon models are inherently designed at taming over-powered boards. India offers a different environment, wherein the rule of the majority shareholders prevails over that of the boards.\nSo, should India shift to some other model of governance such as Japanese, continental, or German, or should we abstain from relying on foreign models for inspiration, and instead develop a more organic and relevant-to-India governance system?\nAgain, it is debatable whether the law needs a reform or the participants need a healthier spirit. One problem with over-prescription of compliances and duties (as is the case in India), is that compliance gets limited to merely being a check-box exercise rather than a pro-active collective effort to adhere to the intent of the law.\nConclusion: Developments and the way forward\n In the wake of these issues, SEBI recently issued a Guidance Note on Board Evaluation, prescribing the parameters against which a director may be evaluated. While the note may bring more clarity regarding a director\xe2\x80\x99s performance in case he is removed, the utility of the evaluation mechanisms is limited. There is no obligation for a company to furnish reasons as to why a director\xe2\x80\x99s removal is being requested. There is speculation that SEBI may amend the law in this regard: the voting requirement may be raised to a super majority.\nMinutes of the SEBI International Advisory Board Meeting show that the regulator has noted the corporate governance challenges in India. More recently, SEBI has also set up a 21-member Committee under the chairmanship of Uday Kotak to recommend changes to the governance framework in listed companies.\n However, as has been seen in the past, such measures have not borne very fruitful results. One reason, as has been pointed out in this article, could be the undue reliance on foreign law, which at most times, does not seem to fit the Indian scenario. A second reason \xe2\x80\x93 more domestic \xe2\x80\x93 is a lack of pro-active desire for good governance.\nIt will be a welcome change if the regulators and legislators institute a governance model that tackles the unique issues present in the Indian context. However, what would be more welcoming is a change in the temperament of the corporate community itself, because governance is more a natural process than one which the law can command. Good governance is a balance of integrity, ethics and a strong value-system, but are our expectations too high?\n'

S'* Switch to DME Oman futures from Platts Oman-Dubai average\n* SOMO to start discussions with buyers\n* Change in benchmark may take effect from Jan 2018 (Adds quote, details)\nBy Florence Tan and Rania El Gamal\nSINGAPORE/DUBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Iraq\'s Oil Marketing Company (SOMO) has informed its customers that it planned to change its price benchmark for Basra crude in Asia to DME Oman futures from the average of Platts\' Oman-Dubai prices with effect from January 2018, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.\nThe proposed change would mark a major shift by OPEC\'s second-largest producer away from fellow members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran which have been using price assessments from global agency S&P Global Platts as their benchmark for decades.\nIt will affect the pricing of about 2 million barrels per day of crude, or close to two-thirds of Iraqi crude exports from the southern port of Basra.\n"The Iraqis probably want to get in on the game of being a benchmark grade," a Singapore-based oil trader said, referring to Saudi\'s role in determining prices in the region.\nWorld\'s top exporter Saudi Arabia typically sets the price trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million bpd of crude bound for Asia.\nSOMO\'s letter will kickstart a consultation round between SOMO and its customers, trade sources said, adding that details of the proposed change were still vague.\nSOMO could not be immediately reached for comment.\nSince April, the producer has been selling 1-2 cargoes of Basra crude per month through an auction platform on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange as a form of price discovery.\nThe Oman crude futures, launched in 2007 by the DME, is the only liquid futures contract for Middle East crude in Asia.

S'Coming out strongly against party hopping and former Chief Minister O Ibobi must surely know what he was talking about when he lashed out at politicians who have been party hopping, especially after the recent Assembly election result was announced. Just take a look at the statistics after the result of the recent Assembly election was announced. Congress emerged the largest party with 28 MLAs but it was BJP with 21 MLAs which managed to form the Government. Other than the tie ups with other political parties such as the NPF and the NPP, the support extended by some rogue Congress MLAs certainly went a long way in helping the BJP reach the magic figure of 31. As things stand today, at least 7 Congress MLAs have switched sides to the BJP led Government and herein lies the double faces of some of these political leaders. Aptly fitting the description of \xe2\x80\x98wake up as X, have lunch as Y and then go to bed as Z.\xe2\x80\x99 The point of the former Chief Minister is noted and here lies the question of how many of the BJP MLAs are originally from the party. At the same time, it should also be noted that the former Chief Minister cannot be said to be entirely free from the tag of supporting party hopping. Remember 2012, when even after returning with a massive figure of 42 MLAs in the election, the Congress did not stop 5 MSCP MLAs from merging with the party in power. If this is not party hopping, then what is, is the natural question that follows. And if at all anyone has benefited immensely from the stringent anti-defection law then it is O Ibobi himself. Remember how the then BJP led NDA Government came out with the stringent anti-defection law when the Congress Government here under O Ibobi was tottering with many Congress MLAs having set up rebel camps at Delhi and Kolkata.\n Now with at least 7 Congress MLAs having switched to the BJP led side, the State can surely witness a series of by elections in at least 7 ACs anytime soon. This is where the voters will be put to test for any election is much more than testing the candidates in the fray but also a test of the mentality of the people who get to vote and decide who should represent them. Do they want the same MLA who has cheated the verdict of the people or do they want a change. This is an important question for remember the same MLA who did not think twice before switching sides, will not hesitate to change again, not for the people but for their own selfish agenda. Prostituting the verdict of the people, may too harsh a term to describe the conduct of these people, but this comes close to the reality. After all it boils down to the fact that the verdict of the people has been sold out for power and the perks that come along with being in power. This is also a clear indication that to many of these so called elected leaders, the fact that they can still do so much even while sitting on the Opposition bench has refused to sink into their mentality. Power at any cost is what matters to them and with such a mindset, how can people trust them to serve the interest of the people and the land.\n'

S" Floods pose serious threat to our animals. They deserve better protection\n Massive floods have claimed the lives of scores of people and displaced thousands, besides disrupting normal life and destroying crops. At the same time, it has yet again brought the attention to something that has now become an annual affair in the north-eastern State: The welfare of the animals in the Kaziranga National Park, which now looks like a death-bed for animals. The world heritage site's one-horned rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, Royal Bengal tigers, Hog deers have all been a global attraction. After being pushed to the brink of being endangered due to extensive poaching, their numbers have increased in the past decade. As per reports, from a population of barely 75 in 1905, Indian rhinos numbered over 2,700 in 2012. Against this backdrop, the death of more than 600 animals in a span of two months in two waves of floods have understandably evoked much concern. Fifteen rare rhinos, 185 deers, and at least one Royal Bengal tiger have lost lives due to the devastating floods. And we have seen some dramatic images of animals being completely submerged in water, while others were seen struggling to find a stable place for survival. The deluge that submerged more than 50 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park, forced the animals to move to higher attitudes as the floods inundated large parts of the national park. There have been heart wrenching images of animals dispersing to towns \xe2\x80\x94 rhinoceroses were spotted struggling their way on the national highway even as this created panic among the people. This is, perhaps, one of the deadliest toll that the floods have taken since 2012 and comes as a reminder that not much work has been done to protect and conserve this country's rich and diverse but also delicate and in many cases endangered wildlife heritage. Nevertheless, while there is no way to make up for the loss of these precious lives, one finds relief from the fact that the authorities as well as the public at large and civil society members have taken stock of the situation. Forest officials are leaving no stone unturned to rescue the animals \xe2\x80\x94 they have intensified water patrolling and have been using drones to track the movement of animals. Besides, water levels too are receding. If another wave doesn't strike, things may well be under control.\n Coming to the larger picture, since climactic conditions and monsoonal flows are not under human control, flooding remains a daunting challenge. Certainly, providing adequate relief measures is a step in the right direction but what is unfortunate is that a long-term solution to the flood problem in the North-East remains elusive. Successive Governments have ignored the situation on ground. The BJP Government that heads the State came to power with a promise to find a permanent solution to flooding problem in the State. The Sarbanand Sonowal dispension must chalk out a comprehensive plan with help from the Centre and find a solution to the long-pestering issue. Declaring the floods issue in the State as a national problem will not solve matters altogether.\n"

S'RJD display a banner with photo of party supremo Lalu Prasad with his wife Rabri Devi and sons Tej Pratap Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav on BISCOMUN Bhawan in Patna on Tuesday for forth coming Maha Rally on Aug 27 (\n LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav will attend RJD\'s "BJP Bhagao, Desh Bachao" rally in Patna on Sunday, but participation of BSP supremo Mayawati appears uncertain as on today. \n "Party president Akhilesh will be visting Patna on August 27 and attend the rally organised by Lalu Prasad," SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury said here. \n The rally is seen as an attempt to forge a larger alliance of like-minded parties to counter the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. \n Both SP and Bahujan Samaj Party have been invited by RJD chief Lalu Prasad for the rally. \n But Mayawati\'s participation appeared uncertain as she distanced herself from posters showing her with non-BJP leaders. \n She issued a clarification condemning as "mischievous and wrong" the posters that surfaced on social media sites showing her in one frame with top non-BJP leaders. \n The posters portrayed her alongside the cut-outs of other opposition leaders -- Akhilesh Yadav, Tejaswi Yadav, Lalu Prasad, Sharad Yadav, Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi. It also carried pictures of some Dalit icons and the BSP logo. \n The poster also carried a message, "Samajik nyay ke samarthan mein vipaksh ek ho (Opposition must unite in the support of social justice)." \n In her statement, Mayawati said, "The party does not have any Twitter account and, therefore, reports appearing in media based on a poster released on it are totally wrong and the BSP denies them." \n'

S'Indians indeed have never been more confident of their future in history and that is reflected in every field. The elephant is more sure-footed than the Chinese Dragon or the British Lion. This is of course, an analysis, confined to geo-political issues. While all of this may come to naught if say, a San Andreas fault were to open up and swallow the state of California or we continue to rape the environment and ensure that the polar caps melt leading to the \xe2\x80\x98Great Flood\xe2\x80\x99. Is it any surprise that all ancient civilisations have their end due to a great flood or \xe2\x80\x98pralay\xe2\x80\x99. But short of these events taking place, one is certain that the world would move in the direction of making the 21st century India\xe2\x80\x99s century, if not by design, then by default.\nGlobalisation as we know it today really began in the 17th century with the growth of sea trade and naval power\xe2\x80\xa6\nAs the world enters the sixteenth year of the 21st century, trends, forces, countries, communities and issues that were barely discernible at the end of the last century are becoming clearer. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Indians have never been as confident about the future of their country as this year. Despite this optimism, internal issues that may pose a danger of regressing into a morass of conflict are noticeable of late. A note of caution is however warranted. Futurology is strewn with the debris of failed prophets such as Fukuyama of Rand Corp. (an important US think tank) who some years ago predicted \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of History\xe2\x80\x9d or his more illustrious predecessor at Rand Corp., Herman Kahn, who had predicted perpetual food riots in India in the year 2000 (\xe2\x80\x98The Year 2000\xe2\x80\x99 MacMillan Press, 1968, page 300) while in reality India has a buffer stock of nearly 19 million tonnes.\nWhat is instead intended here is to sketch out the dominant trends and add a \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 with an \xe2\x80\x98and\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98or\xe2\x80\x99 rider. For there could occur many a revolution that may completely alter the global landscape, for who would have thought in the 1980s that America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98beloved\xe2\x80\x99 Cold War Mujahideen warriors would some day destroy a New York landmark and kill 5,000 Americans!\nA Look at the Past\nGlobalisation as we know it today really began in the 17th century with the growth of sea trade and naval power. England was undoubtedly the first \xe2\x80\x98Global Power\xe2\x80\x99 in that sense and the 19th century can well be called the \xe2\x80\x98British Century\xe2\x80\x99. It was often said then that the sun never set on the British Empire! According to a naughty comment by an African diplomat (from Zambia) that was so because even God did not trust the British in darkness! The astute British diplomacy and her mastery of the sea were the two major components of this phenomenon. But before Britain could establish her sway, she fought a hundred-year war with France, her nearest European competitor.\nRussia is still recovering economically from the ravages of \xe2\x80\x98Communism\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6\nAt the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, British imperial power was at its zenith and none could visualise the demise of the British Empire in less than 60 years time. But the clash with Germany in the First World War broke the back of the British Empire. Britain lost close to one million men in that bloody conflict. Unnoticed by most, the US, a late entrant in that war, lost only 50,000 men and yet was the biggest beneficiary of decline of British power. While the war of 1914-1918 signalled the military emergence of the US, the economic centre of gravity had begun to shift to New York from London even earlier. Unknown to most at that time, the US surpassed the British in maritime tonnage at the beginning of the 20th century. The Second World War firmly established the United States as a Super Power. The US also set a trend of fighting its wars on foreign soil, keeping Fortress America safe from the ravages of war. The 20th century was, undoubtedly, dominated by the US.\nUnder the garb of Communism, the USSR tried to challenge American supremacy but throughout the five-decade long Cold War, there was really only one \xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99 Super Power, the US. Russian challenge was confined to the military field alone and economically, she was no match to the US. Even with regard to military might, the US\xe2\x80\x99 ability to project power worldwide was unmatched and is so even today.\nTowards the end of the 20th century, this Soviet challenge was also overcome with the collapse of Communism and dissolution of the USSR. It would be fair to comment that the Communist experiment collapsed due to its inherent internal contradictions and weaknesses as much due to any American endeavour. It would be correct to say that the USSR lost the Cold War but not necessarily due to America. Along with the defeat of Communism also occurred the end of the much older Russian Empire in Central Asia.\nThere appears to be a big \xe2\x80\x98if\xe2\x80\x99 as far as Russia attaining Super Power status is concerned\xe2\x80\xa6\nRussia is still recovering economically from the ravages of \xe2\x80\x98Communism\xe2\x80\x99. Its countryside resembles India rather than a developed country; for quite some time, Russia will be busy in \xe2\x80\x98Perestroika\xe2\x80\x99 or Rebuilding. The current spurt in assertion is indeed leadership driven by Putin. Although Russia is still an advanced country as far as military technology is concerned, for the next number of years, Russia will be busy (or kept busy by the US) in its neighbourhood. In the medium term, it is bound to be busy fending off Chinese threats to its Far Eastern territories (the Amur region) that is extremely sparsely populated and borders a high population density China. There appears to be a big \xe2\x80\x98if\xe2\x80\x99 as far as Russia attaining Super Power status is concerned.\nIs US Dominance on the Wane?\nUnder its Monroe Doctrine and \xe2\x80\x98Forward Defence\xe2\x80\x99, within less than five years of the end of the Second World War, the US fought a major war in Korea and lost nearly 50,000 men. Though the Korean War was a stalemate, the Americans still succeeded in saving South Korea. But in Vietnam, where she fought for nearly 18 years, she lost nearly 56,000 men and divided American society. In April 1975, Henry Cabot Lodge, the last American Ambassador fled Saigon in a helicopter leaving the war to end in a disaster for the US. A small country, using tactics of guerrilla warfare, had successfully challenged American military power. Osama Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s campaign of terror and present insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan, are logical sequels to the Vietnam episode. Possibly what the US lacked was not military power but the astute diplomacy of the British kind.\nA small country, using tactics of guerrilla warfare, had successfully challenged American military power\xe2\x80\xa6\nBut like the surpassing of the British maritime tonnage at the beginning of the 20th century, another event that \xe2\x80\x98really\xe2\x80\x99 could be called the turning point was reached in the 200th year of American Independence. Yes, one is referring to the breaking of the bond between gold and the dollar- the rock solid $34 for an ounce of Gold! In theory and reality, the dollar was dethroned from its summit from that time onwards. It is a coincidence that the Nixon episode also damaged the US image almost immediately afterwards, most have even forgotten the equally sordid departure of Spiro T Agnew, his Vice Presidential mate. It was in the late seventies that the clamour against the rise of the Japanese economy began in the US. Today, the target is China in manufacturing and India in software!\nThere is indeed some historical parallel here to the Anglo-German rivalry and America benefiting from it, a clash that favoured and led to the rise of America. In the 20th century, China similarly reaped the benefit of the US-USSR clash. Much of the Chinese \xe2\x80\x98miracle\xe2\x80\x99 of today is due to the generous American investment and technology transfers that took place during the Reagan initiated \xe2\x80\x98crusade\xe2\x80\x99 against the Soviet Union.\nBut even more importantly, it is the changing American internal demographic situation that could be a major challenge for future. The Spanish speaking Hispanics and Afro Americans together are in near majority in states such as California, South Carolina and New Mexico. A similar demographic change is underway in many Eastern states. It is only a matter of time before this is reflected in the internal political balance. A million dollars or Henry Kissinger would prefer to say $64,000 (after the most famous crossword puzzle prize) question is \xe2\x80\x9cHow will the White Anglo Saxon Protestants (WASPs) take this change?\xe2\x80\x9d Internal peace in the US would come under increasing pressure in the future. Let us not forget that the Oklahoma bombings were not the work of Osama Bin but of White Supremacists.\nIn the 20th century, China similarly reaped the benefit of the US-USSR clash\xe2\x80\xa6\nHurricane \xe2\x80\x98Katrina\xe2\x80\x99 of August 2005 demonstrated not only the American inefficiency in anticipating and dealing with a natural disaster, but also showed deep fissures within the society. A later much less hyped cyclone \xe2\x80\x98Wilma\xe2\x80\x99 that hit Florida in October 2005 revealed the soft underbelly of the US. I have it directly from one of the Indian immigrants that in the rich and prosperous locality of Fort Lovedale, people went without electricity for one whole week. Without electricity there was no water either. Imagine the plight of a couple in their 70s, living on the 12th floor! The whole town was also put under \xe2\x80\x98curfew\xe2\x80\x99 due to looting! Compared with this even the laid back state government of Maharashtra under Mr Deshmukh reacted swifter to the 26 July 2005 deluge in Mumbai! One really wonders which of the two is a developing country \xe2\x80\x93 India or the US?\nThe US of the 21st century seems to have come a long way from the idealism of Jefferson or Lincoln. What binds the Americans today is the \xe2\x80\x98Ideology of Affluence\xe2\x80\x99, with \xe2\x80\x98Consumerism\xe2\x80\x99 as the ruling deity. But let none make the mistake that the US is likely to fade away, for such is the surplus of resources over population in the US that even a minor change in the wasteful consumption could usher in American economic solvency. Currently, the US is the biggest debtor nation in the world. For instance, if the Americans were to just take to fuel-efficient and small cars, it would be free from need to import any oil\xe2\x80\xa6 But if the US does not change, then there are many parallels with the case of the Soviet Union!\nEmerging China and India on its Tail\nIn a monumental work on world history, Arnold J Toynbee, in his final volume had predicted the rise of India and China as major world powers. Even earlier, nearly 200 years ago, Napoleon had prophesized that China was a \xe2\x80\x98sleeping giant\xe2\x80\x99 and once it awakens, the world will shake. There is absolutely no need to dwell on Chinese economic prowess as that is self-evident. There is some scepticism about it in India though. In the 1950s and 1960s, in Mumbai, plenty of Japanese goods were available through door-to-door salesmen. The most often heard comment used to be that the Japanese goods are shoddy and \xe2\x80\x98cheap\xe2\x80\x99. The preference was for English or German products, due to their perceived durability and superior quality. Before the dawn of 1970s, Japan had excelled in both quality and price. China today is in similar position and could well be like Japan raised to the power of 10. China is already the \xe2\x80\x98Mecca\xe2\x80\x99 of manufacture.\nCurrently, the US is the biggest debtor nation in the world\xe2\x80\xa6\nYet more like the US, China faces daunting internal challenges, possibly more severe and also more plausible. Under the one-party iron rule of the Communist party, there is no individual freedom in China. Even the judiciary is under party control and an individual with personal grievance has no recourse to redress. The news that filters through the \xe2\x80\x98Bamboo Curtain\xe2\x80\x99 often gives glimpses of violent reactions to injustice. But the vice-like grip on power of the Communist Party and the People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Army is such that any organised resistance to the regime is unlikely.\nThe Chinese have been careful to squash any organisation other than the Communist Party. The severe crackdown on the \xe2\x80\x98Guang Falong\xe2\x80\x99 is an example. But individual frustration could lead to acts of terrorism and industrial sabotage. There have already been several such incidents. If these individual revolts against the system take the form of an epidemic, then the effect could indeed derail the Chinese economy. Internet and spread of communications as well as \xe2\x80\x98external\xe2\x80\x99 encouragement could well make it more than a mere pin-prick.\nChina, in its drive for industrialisation, has completely ignored safety and environment. It is indeed strange that a would-be Super Power suffers from mine accidents on a regular basis. In the \xe2\x80\x98Workers Paradise\xe2\x80\x99 the mine workers have no godfather. Would the Indian Communists leave aside their Pavlovian instincts and look at this objectively? The frequent explosions in coal mines raise serious questions about the efficiency of the management and state oversight.\nChina faces daunting internal challenges, possibly more severe and also more plausible\xe2\x80\xa6\nBut the even greater disaster in waiting to happen in China is the utter disregard for the environmental impact of economic development. The recent incident where hazardous chemicals have flowed into a major international river like the Amur is a cause for concern not just for China but even for Russia. The situation has arisen due to the fact that in the Chinese system, there is no room for checks and balances or rival power centres. This may well give an appearance of efficiency and decisiveness, but in reality, results in poor decisions. How can China overcome this, is a question mark. Does it democratise? Can it control the process? There are no easy answers.\nChina has, over last two decades, succeeded in controlling its population. Its rising living standards are to some extent due to this. To achieve this, China enforced the \xe2\x80\x98One Child\xe2\x80\x99 norm. It is well known that in China in general (and India) in rural area in particular, there is a marked preference for a male child. In China\xe2\x80\x99s opaque system with the widespread abortions, it is indeed certain that the male-female ratio is badly skewed in favour of males. What impact this would have on crime and the law and order situation in future, is unknown to even the best of social scientists since this is a indeed a unique case.\nWith the enforcement of the \xe2\x80\x98One Child\xe2\x80\x99 norm, already a large part of the Chinese population would be the \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99 child of its parents. From universal experience of families, it is seen than a single child is often obstinate, demanding and selfish. Imagine a country where 500 million citizens have this psychological disposition. A nation is, after all, a collection of individuals. What will China look like in the future? Will such a nation be able to live in peace with the rest of the world or would it be aggressive and domineering?\nThe Chinese have been careful to squash any organisation other than the Communist Party\xe2\x80\xa6\nThe Chinese Communist Party seems aware of the fragility of its ideology and is, therefore, seeking the rehabilitation of Confucius and Buddha. The internal dynamics of China are uncertain and may swing wildly taking along it the fate of the world.\nElephantine India\nIt is noticeable that the most common animal motif in India is that of the elephant so also its favourite God. Subconsciously, Indians possibly identify their nation with the elephant. India, like the elephant, is slow to move but sure footed, non aggressive, vegetarian and if it makes up its mind, can make the King of Jungle (Super Powers like the Lion or Tiger) run for his life. Vegetarianism and taboo on eating beef has given us food self sufficiency and made us the biggest milk producer in the world and the best is yet to come.\nIndia\xe2\x80\x99s democracy and pluralism are NOT the result of its constitution or the British influence but inherent to India\xe2\x80\x99s civilisational ethos; these are pluralistic at roots. Tolerances of dissent, the linguistic, racial and religious variety, are all a product of this so also the Indian talent in software! An Indian is born in an environment that is free from a single dogma.\nWith its powerful military and nuclear weapons, India is reasonably safe from external threats. The biggest issue in India is internal and that of empowerment of the downtrodden. The Indian constitution gave the affirmative action a pride of place when the so-called advanced democracies were still restrictive. The US gave equal political rights to the Blacks in 1964 and the British granted them to the Irish Catholics in 1968! It is ingenious on the part of these countries to point fingers at us. Yet since the affirmative action came without struggle, there is no appreciation of it.\nWith its powerful military and nuclear weapons, India is reasonably safe from external threats\xe2\x80\xa6\nThe Dalit movement instead of going in the direction of constructive work has found agitation. This is posing a big challenge to law and order as seen often when mobs ostensibly coming to pay homage to Dr. Ambedkar, indulge in rapes and rioting in Maharashtra. It is indeed a bad omen for the Dalits as their progress would be the first casualty of this approach. Much of the violence in India today is out of growing aspirations and not oppression, though the language used is that of \xe2\x80\x98revolution\xe2\x80\x99.\nAnother issue that dominates the media is the problems faced by the \xe2\x80\x98religious minorities\xe2\x80\x99. This is indeed a historical legacy that led to secession of some provinces from India in 1947. The religious minorities, having memories of their rule, subconsciously wish for return of status quo ante and want not just equal but special rights. The vote-bank politics of the last 68 years, instead of striving for social unity (not religious uniformity) has encouraged divisiveness. The elections of 2014 were a watershed in that sense, as minorities for the first time, have become conscious of becoming irrelevant if they continue to follow social, political and economic separatism. The flipside of this \xe2\x80\x98vote bank\xe2\x80\x99 politics has been that the minorities suffer discrimination in all fields. This is neither mandated by law or government but has been a result of constant emphasis on \xe2\x80\x98separatism\xe2\x80\x99. It seems that a thoughtful section of religious minorities have seen through this charade of their so called well-wishers. Even in conflict prone areas like the Kashmir Valley, the new stirrings are discernable.\nThe biggest issue in India is internal and that of empowerment of the downtrodden\xe2\x80\xa6\nSome Indians may be dismayed by the scams involving politicians yet the free media has ensured that the process of accountability has begun. Just as we solved the vexed language issue through the \xe2\x80\x98three language\xe2\x80\x99 formula, there is no issue that cannot be resolved peacefully in India\xe2\x80\x99s democratic context. Indians have always thought globally. \xe2\x80\x98Vasudhev Kutumbakkam\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98the whole world is one family\xe2\x80\x99, was propagated by our ancestors much before anyone else thought of it. Our cultural vibrancy and confidence makes us ready to take on the world, peacefully. Today, the issue is no longer whether India would be a global power but when!\nConclusion\nIndians indeed have never been more confident of their future in history and that is reflected in every field. The elephant is more sure-footed than the Chinese Dragon or the British Lion. This is of course, an analysis, confined to geo-political issues. While all of this may come to naught if say, a San Andreas fault were to open up and swallow the state of California or we continue to rape the environment and ensure that the polar caps melt leading to the \xe2\x80\x98Great Flood\xe2\x80\x99. Is it any surprise that all ancient civilisations have their end due to a great flood or \xe2\x80\x98pralay\xe2\x80\x99. But short of these events taking place, one is certain that the world would move in the direction of making the 21st century India\xe2\x80\x99s century, if not by design, then by default.\n'

S'By Dr. Becker\nIf you have a cat (or cats) at home and are considering adopting a dog, you\'ll obviously want one that gets along with kitties. Unfortunately, what many potential adopters find is that unless a shelter dog has a known history with cats, the jury is out on whether the pooch you\'re considering adding to the family is feline friendly. \nOne of the problems is there\'s no validated assessment tool for shelters to use to test dogs\' ability to get along with cats. But help may be on the way.\nCanine Behavior Assessments Don\'t Test for Cat Compatibility\nA recent study conducted at Canisius College in Buffalo, NY looked at how dogs respond to cats.1 The researchers evaluated dogs\' responses to the sights, sounds and smells of cats to determine which were cat-friendly. The goal of the study was to find ways to evaluate which dogs are most likely to get along with cats, without stressing any kitties out in the process. \nAs lead study author Christy L. Hoffman, Ph.D., assistant professor of animal behavior, ecology and conservation at Canisius told ScienceDaily: "When dogs are waiting for adoption at a shelter, a common question is \'what is the dog like with cats.\'"2\nHowever, shelter behavior assessments are designed only to gauge a dog\'s compatibility with people and other dogs. "Our study investigated what a cat-friendliness assessment might look like," explained Hoffman. The researchers used specific cat-related visual, auditory and olfactory stimuli to compare the responses of dogs with a history of interacting well with cats and other small animals, with those of dogs known to have injured or killed smaller animals.\nStudy Dogs Responded to the Sounds, but Not the Sight or Smell of Cats\nFor the study, the researchers recruited 69 family dogs, both purebred and mixed breeds, and videotaped their responses to three different stimuli, including an animatronic cat, audio recordings of cat sounds and the odor of cat urine.\nSurprisingly, the dogs had stronger responses to the sounds of cats than either the smell or sight of them. "Specifically, dogs with a history of killing or injuring a cat or other small animal spent longer orienting to the cat sounds than the other dogs," reports ScienceDaily. According to Hoffman:\n"As humans, our first thought was to test dogs\' responses to the cat doll because it visually resembles a real cat. However, our findings suggest that dogs are relying more heavily on another sense, hearing. This was surprising since most behavioral assessments focus on dogs\' responses to visual stimuli.\nOur findings suggest that employing assessments that engage other sensory modalities, especially sound, may provide additional clues about an individual dog\'s behavior. Indeed, it may be possible to use audio recordings of cats to assess which shelter dogs are likely to fare well in a home with cats or other small animals."\nHowever, Karen B. London, Ph.D., a certified applied animal behaviorist and professional dog trainer, believes more research is necessary. \n"Because only the auditory stimulus was the actual stimulus that a dog would perceive in the presence of a cat," says London, "it is hard to accept the conclusions of the study. The actual odor of a cat and the sight of a live cat are different than the stimuli presented in the study."3\nI agree more research is needed. I would hate to see shelter dogs ruled out for families with cats based on the findings of just one study. However, the study does suggest there may be kitty-safe innovations on the horizon to better evaluate how dogs respond to cats.\nTips for Introducing a Dog Into a Cat-Centric Home\nIf you\'re adding a dog to a household with one or more kitties, don\'t expect pure bliss from the start. In fact, it\'s better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Then if things go smoothly, you can exhale.\nChances are it will be your cat who needs more TLC. Kitties like their environment and everyone and everything in it to be predictably consistent day-to-day. It helps them feel less vulnerable and more in control of their lives. Here are five recommendations for safely and successfully introducing a new canine family member to Tiger and/or Fluffy:\n1. Go slow. When introducing a new dog to your cat, the last thing you want to do is fling open the door and allow the first meeting to happen on the dog\'s terms. This is a good way to overwhelm and terrify your cat the first time he lays eyes on his new housemate, and his initial fear response can become permanently imprinted.\n2. Instead, before you allow your dog into the house the first time, make sure kitty has escape routes from every room and safe places to climb to and hide under that the dog can\'t access. Make use of a few baby gates or other barriers that keep your dog from entering certain rooms or areas of your home.\n3. Bring your dog in on a leash and keep her restrained and unable to lunge at or get close to your cat. Once kitty realizes he\'s not in imminent danger and makes the first move \xe2\x80\x94 either in the direction of the dog or away from her \xe2\x80\x94 you can lead her a distance away from the cat and take off the leash. \nChances are the dog will head in the direction of the cat, but kitty should be better prepared at this point to handle the advance in whatever manner his instincts tell him to.\n4. It\'s a good idea at this point to distract your dog with a toy or a few treats, a short walk, a romp in the backyard, etc. Get her focus off the cat and onto other features of her new home and family. At no time should your dog be allowed to corner or unintentionally intimidate your cat. Many more kitties are injured by dogs than the reverse, so your first obligation is to keep your cat safe.\n5. Reward your dog whenever she focuses on you rather than the cat.\nKeep in mind that many cats and dogs get along right from the beginning. Others grow to be friends after a period of adjustment. And some learn to co-exist by simply ignoring one another.\n'

S'He turned an emotional movie of love and family into a visual fashion showcase.\n Ace designer Narendra Kumar\'s show has always been something quite out of the ordinary and this time around at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter/Festive 2017, he turned an emotional movie of love and family into a visual fashion showcase on the ramp, to feature a wardrobe for members of the bridal entourage. What made the show special was the angst of the heroine, emotionally torn between her true love (a girl) and family\'s choice of partner.\n Inspired by his imaginary muse, Shayla Patel, a writer, a strong-headed Piscean, who jets between New York, London, Zurich and Mumbai with extensive social media network, the designer dreamt up a winter wedding trousseau for her but what the story unique was the tussle in her mind to choose between her love and her family\'s choice.\n Elaborating about how he got the idea for the story, the designer told IANS: "I know friends who have inclined differently and have same situation. The idea was basic. We wanted to show how India is changing, how women are changing, how men see that change. \n "Having said that its also a story about how in spite of being so educated, independent and confident, she has to live up to other\'s expectations.\n "Every show that I have done always talks about something. I want intelligent people to see the show and I want people to discuss gender issues. This was an issue about what a women\'s choices in today\'s world. Each one of us has that questions to answer." \n Nikita Sahay, who was a captain in the Indian Army when she decided to quit to pursue her childhood dream of modelling, played the protagonist in the film.\n About the experience and the role, Nikita told IANS: "My best part in the film was when I was with my little sister on the beach and I am trying to tell her about my choices. This collection talks a lot about human behaviour."\n "I could relate to the film because so many times in our life we want to make a choice and we loose our sleep over it. It doesn\'t only have to do between two girl lovers or two boy lovers or a boy or a girl love... I am extremely open about things . I have no issue talking about it."\n Narendra Kumar sent a grand wedding invitation when he unveiled his collection \'The Marriage of Shayla Patel\'\n With the film as the backdrop and the soulful voice-over of Kubra Sait who narrated the heroine\'s emotional tussle, the bridal trousseau unveiled in four chapters, each signified by a colour.\n Chapter One - the beige line was devoted to the look of Shayla and her groom-to-be. A glamorous ivory gown with gold embellishments and an ivory double-lapel/vent jacket for the male set the mood for the rest of the show.\n When it came to Chapter Two - green, men\'s wear started with long jackets with placement embroidery, printed two-button coats and Sherwanis. For women\'s wear, there was an assortment of pleated kurtas, ornate fish tail gowns, jumpsuit with floral prints, off-shoulder choli/lehenga/ dupatta, draped collar pleated gown and peplum jackets. Slim sheaths and drop waist maxis were a great addition.\n Chapter Three was devoted to blue, for double-breasted jacket with long skirt, scalloped embroidered gown, plunge \'V\' neck maxi and an ink blue sheath. Narendra Kumar felt a printed angarkha was just the right style for men\'s wear.\n The final red line featured, jackets, diagonal striped blouses, flared pants, velvet gowns, anarkalis, will-power embroidered corset an artist\'s smock, embroidered jacket/pant and a grand embellished choli/lehenga.\n Men\'s wear matched the feminine look with collarless 2-button jackets - some embroidered heavily.\n Selecting with care, the designer zeroed in on the lushest fabrics like taffetas, silks, velvets and the timeless rich Indian textiles. He then put his creativity to the ultimate test as he dreamt up exotic and enchanting, western silhouettes for the cocktail creations that were inspired by Art Deco with a hint of ethnic appeal.\n Embellishments were in the forefront, as rich embroidery in shades of forest green, blue and red glittered on the runway. The sharply-cut tailored jackets, stylishly constructed jumpsuits and memorable grand Red Carpet worthy gowns completed the scintillating trousseaux.\n The look for this collection created by Lakme Makeup Expert, Sandhya Shekar was very character driven and had a personality of its own. The look was kept very bold and strong, and was inspired by the Oscars and the Red Carpet to look fabulous and glamorous.\n \'The Marriage of Shayla Patel\' offered the audience a dual bonus - a great film (co-written and directed by Narendra Kumar with nephew Anirudh Raman) as well as a glamorous collection aimed at strong-willed women who at times go through emotional battles between true love and loyalty to family.\n'

S' BENGALURU: From fetching electricity through batteries made of fruits to charging unplugged cell phone using electromagnetic energy, the Soul Kere Science Fair - Vigyana Habba provided a platform to schoolchildren to showcase the use of science in daily life. \n  The second edition of the science competition organized by Mahadevpura Environment Protection and Development Trust (MAPSAS) on Saturday saw the participation of 45 teams. The event, held at Soul Kere Lake, was organized in collaboration with Genpact, Infosys Science Foundation (Gold Sponsor), Biocon and United Way Bengaluru. \n Class 4 student Rakshan Srinivas and Neil Nikhil Iyengar (Class 2) from National Public School, HSR Layout, demonstrated how a bulb could be lit up using batteries made of fruits and vegetables like lemon, orange, potato, tomato and cucumber. Pointing at the zinc and copper strips inserted into a lemon, Neil explained: "The electrons flowing from zinc to copper through the wires generate electricity and light up the diode." \n Class 3 student Anusha P and Gauri Sharma (Class 1) from Freedom International School explained how water could be filtered without the help of any device. "Water can be naturally filtrated by pouring it through a layer of activated carbon, sand and gravel. This natural process helps in protection of surface water bodies, groundwater aquifers, rainwater harvesting, afforestation and waste-water management," Anusha said. \n Padma Srinivas, joint managing trustee at MAPSAS, said the organization has been working on rejuvenating lakes in the city along with BBMP since 2011. "Soul Kere is one of the lakes MAPSAS has rejuvenated. Through this science competition we are encouraging children to get involved in civic issues and come up with innovative solutions using science," Padma said. \n'

S"\xe2\x80\x8bManchester United have made the best possible start to the Premier League season with two 4-0 victories over West Ham United and Swansea City respectively. Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba have been among the goals and Henrikh Mkhitaryan is showing his true class with four assists to his name. \nHere we look at three players who are bound to improve in the new season.\n3. Anthony Martial\n\xe2\x80\x8bAfter a wonderful debut campaign which saw him finish as Manchester United's leading goal scorer, Anthony Martial had a pretty disappointing 2016/17 season starting just 18 games scoring four goals.\nManager Jose Mourinho publicly demanded a change in attitude from the striker and it looks like that Martial may have listened to the manager after he came on from the bench and scored a goal each in the first two games. With such performances, the Frenchman has staked a claim for a place in the starting lineup and Mourinho might be temped to start him in the next match.\nDespite being linked with a move elsewhere, he is set to stay at Untied and we can expect to see more of his pace, trickery and of course more goals in the new season. \n2. Paul Pogba\n\xe2\x80\x8bIt won't be wrong to say that Paul Pogba did not have a great season after his \xc2\xa389m move from Juventus. The Frenchman who made 30 appearances in the league last season, scored five and registered four assists which is not enough for a player of his calibre.\nHowever, it must be kept in mind that Pogba had to sit in front of the back four and was not able to join the attacks as much as he would like. This is where the signing of Nemanja Matic will be crucial as the Serb will do the defensive duties and it will free up Pogba to bomb on forward.\nThe Frenchman has already scored two goals in the opening two games of the Premier League and this will be the season where we will see what the 24-year-old is truly capable of.\n1. Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\xe2\x80\x8bAfter winning the Bundesliga Player of the Season, Henrikh Mkhitaryan joined Manchester United last season and expectations were understandably very high from the Armenian. However, he was eased into the Premier League by Jose Mourinho and made sporadic appearances in the first few months of the season.\nMkhitaryan played a crucial role in United's Europa League triumph scoring six goals including one in the final. However, he struggled in the league registering just one assist in 24 appearances.\nBut we are now starting to see the true class of Mkhitaryan with the Armenian assisting four goals in the opening two games and if this is a sign of things to come, he could break the record for most assists in a season.\n"

S" Kolkata June 5 (IBNS): One of Kolkata's leading fine dining restaurant chain serving Bengali cuisine, 6 Ballygunge Place, is celebrating The Great Indian Tiffin Festival until June 10.\n The festival is being held at The Bengal Lounge, formerly known as the Palladian Lounge, located in the heritage Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industries, in the heart of the city. It is open to all.\n Although the practice is on the wane now, with the advent of quick service restaurants and delivery options, carrying lunch boxes to offices was a tradition of Indian office-goers. Popularly, known as 'tiffin box', they came in various shapes and sizes but the content of the box was invariably home-cooked food.\n Sharing the contents of the lunch box was sign of camaraderie back then.\n Recreating that tradition is the Great Indian Tiffin Festival, showcasing the lunchbox food components typical of various Indian states.\n The options are many, ranging from Murli\xe2\x80\x99s tiffin box with upma, idli,chutney, payasam and masala chaai to Khan Saheber Nasta with Paratha, Mutton Tikia, Chap, Rooh Afza and Phirni, from Wagleji Ka Dabba, consisting of a typically Marathi tiffin of Misal Pav, Payasam and Nimboo Pani to Sharmaji\xe2\x80\x99s Favourite Tiffin which contains Lassi, Chhole Bhatura, pickle, salad and Gulab Jamun, and many others.\n Restaurant director, Swaminathan Ramani, said that with the The Great Indian Tiffin Festival, they want to bring back the romance of sharing food from tiffin boxes by serving them fresh and hot.\n Director and Founder Aninda Palit said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bengal Lounge is situated in office-para (area) of Dalhousie, so tiffin is an essential requirement in this area. The festival is based on Indian tiffin-foods from all over the country. Be it Marathi, South Indian, Bengali, or Mughlai, lunch-boxes to suit every palate is here. For kids, there is Khoka Babu\xe2\x80\x99s lunch box with Indian style French toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n He also said to IBNS that specialized chefs from all over the country have been consulted to prepare these regionally unique lunch boxes.\n The veg tiffin boxes cost Rs. 150 and non-veg boxes Rs. 315, which seems fair enough for a quick office lunch without burning a hole in the pocket.\n (Reporting by Ayana Chatterjee)\n Image: 91.9 Friends FM/Twitter\n"

S'The secret is the moderate excercise on the inside jog as well as the intense minute of exercising. You can do many variations of this with any excercise however the key is always to do moderate effort for your few minutes followed a new minute of going all out, then repeat the procedure many the times. If you match 3-5 cardio sessions full week with 3-4 weight lifting sessions realizing what\xe2\x80\x99s good be burning calories and fat like nobodys smaller business. I encourage a person experiment another thing different involving cardio including swimming and sports in order to locate what is ideal for your corporation. This is undoubtedly the biggest part of fat loss and should be continued even though you are satisfied to your weight.\nFish needless to say is another option to be included within your meals. Dark meat fish is considered best to obtain rid of weight. Fish such as salmon, sardines and tuna are considered top remedies. Fun fact: an individual fish generates a hormone in humans called Lepton which helps burn excess fat in system fitness recovery .\nLook behind the brand. The ingredients in the department store brands accomplish more destruction of your body than decent. Just check out the Dirty Dozen in a Google check. There are carcinogens, irritants, and what cause birth defects in those creams.\nYou can operate without your protein powder. Might find find enough energy to get through your next workout without a sports drink. You can even sustain heavy workouts for the days and days without eating properly. We can\xe2\x80\x99t stay alive without water.\nOne crucial aspect of burning fat that can help you carried out right is supplementation. Most people screw this up as they quite simply just go buy some random diet pills or the workout supplement of the month. As a way to feel great things about supplementation accumulates use the particular ones. A person do, regardless of fat burning pills. The initial few basic excercise supplements can be found at a grocery keep. These are Multivitamins and omega-3 fatty acids capsules. Omega-3 fatty acid helps muscle recovery and overall health, along with the multivitamin provides your body with the nutrients it in order to function a great deal better.\n weight loss shakes \nSo, my advice to you, use the \xe2\x80\x9cbig\xe2\x80\x9d brands sparingly. Shop the small boutique and hand made brands. Organizations are very likely to spend their dollars on top quality ingredients. A screening test of a great product is when you can see the label and pronounce all components listed.\nA good set of exercises doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide just pictures and descriptions of methods to carry out the exercises, it tells you which ones part of this body the exercise is meant to be targeting, why it works and operate should finished. The only technique to build lean muscle is through interval training: lifting to get a period of time, holding for time then decreasing the mass. A skilled set of exercises additionally include the most important regarding a workout: recovery. If your exercises don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how often you\xe2\x80\x99ll need rest following a work out, don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it, because doing so will provide injury.\n weight loss balloon deaths \nAFTER LIFTING, GOD Well rested. YOU SHOULD TOO: Muscles also require rest to grow. Sleep as much since you can easily each night. And rest specific muscle groups, too: all large muscles, which includes back, chest, quads require seventy-two hours rest between workouts. Biceps, triceps, shoulders need forty-eight hours of rest, and muscles comprising the abdominals, calves, and forearms, need twenty-four hours of rest, which suggests they could be trained additional day. Because of these slow-twitch muscles, high-repetition exercises will supply best ends up.\n'

S'The fashion-society imposes many annoying rules on plus size women. They are often restricted about what type of clothing suits them or what prints must get avoided. This leads to confine them only to a t-shirt and baggy jeans. Thus, fashion gets a backseat. However, today, plus-sized women do not feel ashamed of their curves and thus do not need lots of clothing to hide their bulges. Today\xe2\x80\x99s fashion world celebrates healthy figure and there are even bikini models of plus-size. If you are someone with a healthy body, it is time you feel good and confident about your beauty and also move out of the conventions.\nHere are some new rules for plus clothing which tosses out the old views: \n 1. Wear White: Celebrity stylists believe that flattering garments are those that fit best. Both black and white tops can make one look larger if the fitting is not right. The only point to see is not to choose flimsy fabrics when you shop for plus-size white dresses. Choose something in white which has structure and substance.\n2. Stripes Are Not Your Enemies: You do not need to restrict yourself from wearing stripes. Designers are today making asymmetrical stripes that can make you look smaller. Go for stripes which angle inwards. This helps the waistline to appear slimmer. So, you need to be tricky while wearing stripes rather than avoiding the style altogether.\n3. Come Out Of The Basics And Follow The Trend: Apply the trick of adopting a trend which works best as per your shape. Do you love crop tops? Choose the one with a longer cut and style it with a pencil skirt which is high-waisted. It is wise to go for multi-toned dresses provided the darker colours and vertical panels get positioned over the areas which you wish to downplay. This can be a great slimming option. Dying to try harem pants? Choose a draping and stretch pair. Never say you cannot fit into a particular styling pattern. Doing so, you can miss out something that can be best for you.\n4. Baggy Is Not The Solution Anymore: Billowing fabric makes you look larger rather than hiding the bulges. Choose the type of clothes that follow your curves and not something that is clingy. Today, the fabrics that get used have a good stretch amount and thus offer a sexy and smooth look. Designers are of the opinion that volume looks good either on the bottom or on the top. A head-to-toe voluminous wear is not flattering for anyone.\n5. Choose Any Print And Bright Colours: You can go for any colour you want depending upon your complexion. It is all about the fitting and cut of the outfit. Even a dark red colour can look flattering on plus-size women if the fit is perfect. Choose prints as per the scale of your body. Tiny prints often disappear if you have a large size. Water colour prints are perfect options as they melt into one another and look vibrant.\nSo, ladies go ahead and break those odds and get ready to flaunt your healthy figures. It is only when you love yourself, that you can break the norms. Put on a pair of sassy stilettos with the kind of clothing that you have always dreamt of flaunting.\n'

S'Eight cows were impregnated in Ganganagar six months ago by the Rajasthan Gopalan department in a bid to promote genetically superior indigenous cow breeds.\nCome October, and Rajasthan will welcome calves of superior indigenous breed, the first in the state to be born through surrogacy.\nEight cows were impregnated in Ganganagar six months ago by the Rajasthan Gopalan department in a bid to promote genetically superior indigenous cow breeds.\nOn Sunday, a dairy farmer in Indapur near Pune became the proud owner of the first calf born through surrogacy or In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) technology carried out in a mobile laboratory.\nThe experiment was done with eggs and semen of indigenous Sahiwal breed, Gopalan department additional director, Dr Lal Singh told HT. Sahiwal is a breed of zebu cattle, primarily used in dairy production. The breed originated from Sahiwal district of Punjab province (now in Pakistan) in undivided India. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next round of experiment will be carried out using Gir breed,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Singh said.\n \xe2\x80\x9cIn Ganganagar, eggs of four donor cows were used and embryos were selected after a qualitative analysis to impregnate eight cows. Mobile labs were used to ensure the process takes place at the doorstep of the recipient cows,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Singh said. \nThe eggs taken from the Sahiwal cow were kept in a special incubator for 24 hours and then the fertilisation process began with the semen collected from a Sahiwal bull. After seven days, the zygote or the embryo thus formed was transferred to the recipient cow, depending upon its oestrus cycle to ensure that its body accepts it as its own embryo, thereby increasing the chances of pregnancy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe surrogate process also enables birth of more number of superior breed animals in a year. While the recipient cow could be an inferior breed, when the zygote of superior breed has been transplanted, it will give birth to a calf of superior breed,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Singh said. The government has also started registration of superior breed bulls and will carry out castration of inferior bulls.\n'

He said that the blame for this complete turnabout lay not just with the leaders but the masses or the citizens themselves who have embraced what they have rejected earlier. This \xe2\x80\x9cjob politics\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe politics of appeasement\xe2\x80\x9d has led to a bankruptcy of ideas, he added. \nAC Kharingpam, talks revolved around the question of what amounted to change and the importance of mapping it out, keeping in mind the reality of the existential experiences there of politics. He stressed that the change in politics was not all about what has been but what has been left out or been denied or what has not been voiced out. He pointed out that the recent changes or dynamics in the structure of the politics of Nagaland, were factors such as the rise of NPF, with its pan Naga identity, the growth or the receding influence of NPMHR, the recently declared framework agreement, the role of church, the demise of student politics such as the NSF and the NSUD and the rise of regionalism. \nJames Pochury, stressed on the need for a participatory democracy, if at all the focus was on solutions rather than the problems that revolved around issues that the Nagas were faced with today. The wedge, between the powerless and the powerful, has grown to an extent that there is no easy solution but to engage with the systemic issues, he added. The answer he proposed lay not in transfer of power from one hegemonic group to another but in the transfer of power to a more \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity-centered participatory structure\xe2\x80\x9d that is reflective of a \xe2\x80\x9cnon-centralized system which is more democratic.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe rapporteur of the panel discussion was Solomon Zingkhai and the discussion ended with a vote of thanks by Shelmi Sankhil, the vice president of NSA. Earlier, welcome address was delivered by NSA president, Dr. Zuchamo Yanthan and moderated by assistant general secretary NSA, Dr Lungthuiyang. \n'

S'Try a quick circuit to keep you energized on your business trip.\nYou know the frustration: not just all the crap that comes with business travel, but also how it too often breaks your fitness routine. Five days on the road and suddenly all that work you\'ve been doing goes down the crapper. By the time you get home, it feels like you\'ve been set back five weeks.\nThe good news: Physical upkeep takes little time, and even less equipment. "It\'s just circuit-based training," says Noah Neiman, trainer to jet-setting stars like Justin Bieber, founder of Rumble boxing gyms, and bona fide Instagram personality (@noahdneiman, if you want to be humbled by an eight-pack). "You get a couple of exercises, you do them in order, you repeat them, and you keep going for whatever amount of time you have." Take a look at the easy exercises below, remember that Neiman suggests you aim for AMRAP (as many rounds as possible), and you can maintain your fitness\xe2\x80\x94even if you can\'t make it to the hotel fitness center.\nCircuit Makers\nPick a routine and cycle through it as many times as you can in 12 minutes, taking 30-second breaks at four-minute intervals. Or, work your way through all three.\nBeginner\n10 lunges\n10 jumping jacks\n30 toe touches\nIntermediate\n10 squats\n10 push-ups\n30 bicycle crunches\nAdvanced\n10 burpees\n20 mountain climbers\n30 high knees\nThis article originally appeared in the September \'17 issue. \n'

S'What do a kingfisher, cocklebur pods and a Namibian beetle have in common? Besides being living organisms, they have all served as inspiration for creative human technologies to solve challenging problems.\nThe kingfisher\xe2\x80\x99s sleek beak spurred the streamlined nose design on high-speed trains in Japan. Cockleburs inspired the hook-and-loop fastener system Velcro. And the Namibian beetle\xe2\x80\x99s back inspired a water-collection plant in the desert.\nThis is biomimicry. It is an approach to innovation, defined by the Biomimicry Institute as seeking: \xe2\x80\x9csustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature\xe2\x80\x99s time-tested patterns and strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d There are many solutions in nature \xe2\x80\x94 and we are learning about more and more of them.\nAs a researcher in materials science and engineering, I have worked on a variety of different substances. These include biomaterials (implantable ceramics, dental ceramics and titanium alloys) and a variety of different coatings technologies (thermal barrier coatings in turbine engines, corrosion-resistant coatings and catalyst supports).\nBiomimicry has helped my teams design solutions that we otherwise would likely not have explored. Inspiration has come from organisms themselves, how organisms make materials and how organisms work together. For example, based on structures observed on plant leaves, we have grown ceramic coatings at room temperature to make oil and water filters on paper and on copper mesh.\nHow biomimicry works\nWithout flying insects, birds and floating seeds would we have been able to create airplanes, gliders, parachutes or helicopters?\nWatch a maple seed spin to the ground or a dandelion seed float through the air and I am sure you will start asking more questions.\nHuman beings are generally curious and observant and we have made many innovations by looking to the natural world for inspiration. We seek to understand and then we \xe2\x80\x9ccopy\xe2\x80\x9d existing solutions. The process of biomimicry is also about being curious and observant. We follow a disciplined process to ask questions and seek answers by looking at what is already around in nature.\nWe first observe functions \xe2\x80\x94 what does the organism do? The function can be simple or complex: A dandelion seed floating through the air, or chemical signalling in the body to grow bone. We observe how an organism achieves such a function.\nWe then determine the mechanisms by which the functions are accomplished \xe2\x80\x94 we get to the chemistry and physics of the mechanisms. The final stage is to abstract the natural form, process or ecosystem into another purpose \xe2\x80\x94 to mimic for our own use.\nLeaf coatings\nIt pays to pay attention. In the past, I had a research project to devise new ways to make structured catalysts (coatings that better enable chemical reactions.) The team was processing metal wire mesh \xe2\x80\x94 to produce ceramic hair-like structures onto which we were to deposit metallic nanoparticles.\nWe could fabricate the mesh, but the graduate student came to me one day and said that something \xe2\x80\x9cweird\xe2\x80\x9d was happening. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the nanoparticle precursor solution (the mixture of chemicals that helps to make the final product) to wet the treated wire mesh. The wire mesh was floating on the water-based liquid.\nWe did not understand what was going on, and so we looked at the structure in the microscope. We still didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and so we looked to nature. I took a trip to our greenhouse on campus armed with a water bottle. The manager showed me a variety of plants that repelled water in fascinating ways, and I squirted water on them to see what happened.\nWater drops do not wet the leaf surfaces of the Elegant Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s Pipe (Aristolochia elegans) at all. Author provided\nI looked at a variety of plants in the microscope, and found that sugar cane had a similar structure to the ceramic coating.\nI was amazed, and it was the start of a new research direction for me; I wanted to figure out how to make coatings to mimic leaves.\nHydrophobic (water repelling) coatings, based on the structures of the waxes found on leaf surfaces, are used in many applications \xe2\x80\x94 from paints (such as Lotusan brand) to power-generation, where efficiency can be gained by controlling droplet formation in condensers and boilers. By paying attention to how nature behaves, and by getting down to the chemical and physical mechanisms, we are able to create bio-inspired solutions from other materials and for different applications.\nGrowing bone tissue\nIn high school, my friend told me about a bone defect in his leg \xe2\x80\x94 a big hole in his thigh bone. He was running and his thigh bone fractured, and he collapsed. He awoke in the hospital five centimetres shorter. Why? Because 25 years ago, bone defects couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be repaired very easily and the damaged tissue had to be surgically removed. There was nothing bone-like that could be put in the damaged tissue\xe2\x80\x99s place to grow new bone. His perfectly good leg had to be shortened too.\nToday, because of biomimicry, we can repair and regenerate bone tissue \xe2\x80\x94 breaking your leg doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean you also become shorter! How can we do now what we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t before? We have learned how the body grows bone tissue, and we have been able to induce bone growth by mimicking nature\xe2\x80\x99s processes.\nWe can now make glass in a lab, implant it, and new bone will grow in its place. Three months later, there is no trace of the glass. It sounds a lot like the \xe2\x80\x9cSkele-Gro\xe2\x80\x9d potion from the Harry Potter series but without the vile taste! Our innovations were inspired by ourselves \xe2\x80\x93 after all, we too are part of nature.\nBioactive glass, a calcium phosphate based silica glass that stimulates material resorption and bone growth, is often used in dental applications for bone grafts. The material is placed in a bone defect and over time, under the stresses and the biological environment, the glass corrodes and signals bone cells (osteoblasts) to attach and proliferate at the surface and form new bone. The implanted glass is completely dissolved and replaced with new bone.\nBiomimicry and the future\nAnd what of the future? We are seeing and learning so much more about what happens in the natural world through time and sophisticated research studies that it is difficult to predict what we might learn in the future. However, as we learn more, we discover that we have made gross oversimplifications for many natural phenomena \xe2\x80\x94 so we need to remain curious and observant of the natural world and get down to the details, without losing sight of the entire system.\nAnd, since people are pursuing brain machine interfaces, perhaps we may also consider pursing some other fantasies. Tsaheylu of the Na\xe2\x80\x99vi people in the movie Avatar is \xe2\x80\x9cthe bond\xe2\x80\x9d between different animals \xe2\x80\x94 a way to feel as one with the ability to act as one. Imagine if instead of mimicking nature we could become one with it instead. I wonder what other secrets we might learn from the kingfisher, cocklebur pods and the Namibian beetle.\nJohn A. Nychka, Professor of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Alberta\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.\n'

S' Mamata Banerjee demanded a central government package for her flood-hit state, on the lines of the grants given to BJP-ruled Assam and Gujarat. \nMamata Banerjee visited the flood-affected areas of three north Bengal districts today. (PTI)\nMalda: Around 152 people have died and 1.5 crore hit by the floods in West Bengal said Mamata Banerjee on Monday. The Chief Minister also demanded a central government package for her flood-hit state, on the lines of the grants given to BJP-ruled Assam and Gujarat.\n "Centre has given a package of Rs 2,000 crore to flood-hit Assam, also a package has been given to Gujarat. I have no objection. I want all states to get central help. But fury of the floods is no less in Bengal than Gujarat and Assam. \n"We will also send a detailed report. We want we be given whatever is our due," she said in Malda while on a visit to the flood-affected areas of three north Bengal districts.\n Ms Banerjee alleged that she had earlier written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi a multiple times on the issue of the Ganga river erosion in parts of the state, but the Central government did not act.\n Hitting out at the Centre, she said it should undertake proper dredging of barrages.\n "But there was no proper dredging of the Farakka barrage, same with the Damodar Valley Corporation barrages," she said.\n Ms Banerjee alleged that the fresh wave of floods in northern West Bengal was caused after an embankment in Bihar\'s Purnea district was "broken".\n The state government has lodged an official complaint.\n "In Purnea, an embankment was broken. I didn\'t know about this. One District Magistrate told me. We have lodged an official complaint," she said.\n'

S'Aww. Blake Shelton took Gwen Stefani out for a hot time in Oklahoma before heading to the Thunder Music festival. While on their date, the two met some fans and engaged in some sweet PDA. How cute!\nIs Tishomingo the hot new destination for lovebirds? Could be. Blake Shelton, 41, and Gwen Stefani, 47, certainly brought the romance when the visited the Oklahoma town on Aug. 19. While taking his lady around town, these two music superstars ran into some fans. \xe2\x80\x9cI just met Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin Wigley posted on Facebook. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan [and] it was a pleasure to meet you both!\xe2\x80\x9d The young man even got Blake to sign his guitar \xe2\x80\x93 what an honor! The \xe2\x80\x9cA Guy with a Girl\xe2\x80\x9d singer was happy to do it, and Blake was all smiles when he embraced Gwen during another picture with a fan.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s another pic with a guy from another crew,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin said. \xe2\x80\x9cGwen is fine as hell. Just saying.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, Blake would certainly agree. He was smiling from ear to ear with Gwen by his side, probably happy to get some PDA in before he had to fly out to Canada. Blake is scheduled to be part of the Country Thunder festival in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on Aug. 20 (along with some of county music\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names, like Brad Paisley, 44, Thomas Rhett, 27, Terri Clark, 49, and more.) Assuming he\xe2\x80\x99s flying out of Oklahoma City, he had a six hour flight ahead of him so he definitely needed to squeeze in as much PDA with Gwen before going to work.\nSo, why Tishomingo? Is it really on par with Paris, Venice and other romantic cities? Maybe. Well, from the looks of things, anywhere Blake and Gwen go can be romantic, as these two just seem so in love with each other. However, they were in Tishomingo because Blake is opening an entertainment venue there. The bar and restaurant, named Ol\xe2\x80\x99 Red after Blake\xe2\x80\x99s song of the same name, is expected to open in September, according to its website. The Oklahoma bar will be an extension of the much larger Ole Red that\xe2\x80\x99s being built in Nashville, Tennessee. Nice. Considering that Austin Wigley said he was part of the \xe2\x80\x9cCleaning crew\xe2\x80\x9d at Ole Red, is seemed Blake was just checking out some last minute details before its big opening day.\nCould Tishomingo be a nice place to raise a family? While Gwen is already a mother \xe2\x80\x93 of three boys with her ex, Gavin Rossdale, 51, \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s looking to have a fourth child with Blake. She\xe2\x80\x99s undergoing \xe2\x80\x9cacupuncture and working with a Chinese herbalist to increase her fertility,\xe2\x80\x9d an insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. Hopefully Blake rushes home from Canada so he can help out in making a baby.\nDo you think Gwen and Blake should get married, HollywoodLifers? Are you a big fan of their romance?\n'

S'Skin care regime nowadays is not just a woman\'s prerogative. Noted beautician Shahnaz Husain has revealed the core difference between the skin of the two sexes. "Men\'s skin is a little oilier and thicker than women. The difference also lies in texture, hydration and collagen density.\nSkincare products of men are manufactured differently as compared to women\'s products but the basic element of effective skin care remains the same," says Husain.\nHere are some essential skin care tips for men:\n*To avoid dull, brittle and dry skin, men need to cleanse, tone and moisturise their skin. It will help maintain tighter, younger skin and protect it from atmospheric pollution, sun exposure and other pollutants.\n*Natural, Ayurvedic products should be used in the morning and at night to make your skin look fresh. A light cleansing gel or face wash can be applied on the skin and wiped off with moist cotton wool or washed off. It will leave the skin cleansed, without causing moisture depletion. Rinse the skin well with plain water and dab on a skin tonic to tone and refresh the skin. Rose water may be used as a toner.\n*For oily skin, mix rose water and astringent lotion in equal quantities. Rose-based skin tonic is also available. This can be a pre-shave routine.\n*If the skin is oily and prone to blackheads, a facial scrub should be used twice a week, rubbing it gently on the skin, using circular movements and washing off with plain water.\n*For shaving, choose a gentle, creamy, emollient product. This softens the hair, making shaving easier. It also leaves the skin feeling smooth and supple.\n*Most after-shave lotions are alcohol-based, which can have a drying effect on the skin. A non-greasy after-shave cream which contains powerful antiseptic sandalwood would be ideal. Along with it, use a cream that helps to keep skin moisturised, especially in monsoon and winter.\n*Two of the most important aspects of a daily routine for men are cleansing and sun protection. Cleansing at night is of utmost importance to remove all the pollutants that have been deposited on the skin during the day. Men spend more time outdoors in the sun. The application of sunscreen before going out helps to prevent UV ray damage, sunburn and premature ageing.\n*With age, the skin care routine should include nourishing. The application of night creams with a light massage, helps to improve skin texture. Nourishing cream containing antioxidants like wheat germ oil, or vitamin-rich ingredients help keep the skin looking younger and can have a rejuvenating effect.\n* Using a facial scrub once a week help remove dead cells and boosts the skin\'s cell renewal process. Scrubs should not be applied on pimples, acne or rash though.\n* Weekly salon facials also go a long way towards delaying the signs of ageing and rejuvenating the skin. Apart from maintaining skin elasticity, facial massages help to improve the normal functions of the skin, including that of cell renewal. Face, head and body massages also have great value in terms of inducing relaxation and reducing stress. For oily skin and eruptive conditions, a facial treatment with clean-up should be done instead of facial massage with cream.\n'

S' Luxury car business in India needs to be nurtured and allowed to grow in a relaxed taxation environment to raise overall standards, exceed customer expectations, bring increased revenues, augment employment generation, contribute to the GDP and bring environment friendly, world-class technologies\n The Indian automotive industry requires a clearly mapped, bump-free route for it to be a true nation builder. The automotive industry is acknowledged world-wide as the pulse of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s no different for India: The importance of a robust auto industry to an emerging nation cannot be overstated. Currently, the automotive industry in India contributes a not-insignificant 7.1 per cent to the country\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product and has the potential to grow further. In fact, the Indian automotive industry is already poised to become the third largest in the world by 2020.\n However, this positivity has to be matched by policies that help the industry and the Government drive together towards a more prosperous future for the nation and its people. The Government of India\xe2\x80\x99s various and the most remarkable initiatives have always been matched by the automotive industry\xe2\x80\x99s hearty support for them. Make in India, Skill India, a strong infrastructural push and demonetisation are all substantial measures that have had the net effect of propelling India forward for a more prosperous tomorrow. The industry has expressed its support for these initiatives in no short measure.\n Among these initiatives, the Indian auto industry had whole-heartedly accepted the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) and there was a universal acclaim for this move as it makes India a single market. Specifically for automobiles, it promised rationalised purchase prices across the country and in fact, Mercedes-Benz, India, was the first to pass on the benefits to our customers, even before the formal introduction of the GST.\n The promise of revised prices in the GST regime would have translated to a substantial uptick in sales in cars and SUVs and created a strong, positive sentiment in the automotive market. However, in just a month since GST was implemented, there was a sudden dampener to this prospect of unfettered growth: A proposal to increase the cess over and above the GST from 15 to 25 per cent. This, clubbed with an increase in road tax rates in some States, would effectively take the price of luxury cars and SUVs well above the pre-GST levels.\n This is a fundamental and unexpected change in the tax regime that significantly affects the strategy that a company like Mercedes-Benz, India, has laid out for our growth plan in the country. The proposed increase in cess is but one of the several policy changes that has constructed speed-breakers on what could have essentially been a smooth road.\n A ban on diesel vehicles over 2000cc, additional taxes on luxury vehicles in the Union Budget, an additional one per cent environment compensation charge on diesel vehicles over 2000cc in Delhi, National Capital Region, an increased GST rate on hybrid vehicles are some more examples of indiscriminate shifts in policy.\n The effect these unexpected policy changes have on the workings of companies is that instead of driving confidently towards the overall growth, they are forced to scramble towards short-term measures that are devised only to mitigate the current circumstances and nothing else.\n Sudden policy changes have many other serious ramifications too \xe2\x80\x94 they curtail expansion plans that would otherwise have led to job creation and create a multiplier effect that transcends geographies and aids economic growth. These curtail the potential revenue generation that could have come with the estimated volume growth and restrictcompany managements from making any carefully crafted long-term plans for India. It has the potential to even affect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Make in India\xe2\x80\x99 programme.\n Any major policy change needs time to take effect. And the efficacy and intended objective of this new policy would need to be measured after giving it sufficient time and course corrections implemented accordingly. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t given enough time to chart the course set out by the implementation of GST to consider levying an increase in cess.\n Perhaps, the thinking is that luxury cars and SUVs, like other sin goods, are for the indulgence of a miniscule percentage of Indians. We need to change this mentality and realise that the state-of-the-art SUVs and luxury cars are demonstrators of thoughtful innovation, extensive research and development and proven technology.\n When it comes to essential parametres like safety, performance, fuel efficiency, comfort, emissions and driving pleasure, these automobiles are at the very top of the automotive ecosystem. They also inspire and drive mass car brands to improve their product offerings and, thus, take up the overall standards of automobiles.\n With the increase in cess, these vehicles essentially will continue to remain inaccessible to a larger customer base, keeping them away from a superior technology they could have owned. When seen from this perspective, it becomes clear that luxury cars are not just an indulgence for a few, but play a vital role in the overall automotive ecosystem and touch more lives than its intended real users.\n In my opinion, the luxury car business is not only for high-end users but also touches the society at every stage, giving it an opportunity to refine and lift itself up. The luxury car business in India needs to be nurtured and allowed to grow in a relaxed taxation environment to raise overall standards, exceed customer expectations, bring in increased revenues, augment employment generation, contribute to the GDP and bring in safer, environment friendly and world-class technologies at a quicker pace.\n By charting the growth course of the luxury car industry we provide the much-needed opportunity to our younger generation to appreciate the finer things in life. It\xe2\x80\x99s only enlightened and consistent Government policies that can make that happen. And our wait continues.\n (The writer is Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mercedes Benz, India)\n'

There's no magic pill that can help you shed all the pounds but some natural herbs can definitely support your goals and accelerate the process of weight loss. It goes without saying that you can't do without a good workout regime and a healthy and balanced diet but these herbs can give you an extra boost. 1. Garlic: Love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Garlic helps in burning body fat faster. A lot of people suggest that you should consume two to three cloves of garlic every morning on an empty stomach along with a glass of warm lemon water to improve your blood circulation and boost the process of weight loss.\nGarlic helps in burning body fat faster.

S'I, along with four others, reached Bombay Hospital, Indore on August 8 to meet Medha Patkar who was forcefully hospitalised on the 12th day of her indefinite fast by the Madhya Pradesh police.\nMedha Patkar was fasting to protest against the illegal submergence of 192 villages and one township in Madhya Pradesh by the backwaters of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.\nI work closely with Medha Patkar. I work with the \xe2\x80\x98Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan\xe2\x80\x99 (Save Home-Build Home Movement) in Mumbai. Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan (GBGBA) has exposed major scams from the likes of Adarsh to scams in slum rehabilitation scheme in Golibar, undertaken by Shivalik Developers. Medha Patkar has been the leader of this movement.\nI am also engaged with the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) as a part time activist. I was taking part in the indefinite fast protest organised by the NBA.\nSome of us decided to leave for Bombay Hospital as soon as we found out where the police had taken Medha after forcefully picking her up from Chikhalda \xe2\x80\x93 the fasting site. As we reached the hospital, we realised that no one was allowed to meet with Medha.\nIt is worth noting that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted that Medha was just hospitalised due to her deteriorating health brought on by her fast and not arrested. Hence, we got into argument with the police as they were restricting entry to meet Medha Patkar.\nOur demand was to at least allow one attendant with her if not visitors. The media recorded our arguments with the police and started broadcasting the incident. The police were visibly annoyed by us. I could sense that I was on watch in the hospital premises.\nThis suspicion was confirmed as I made my way to the washroom. I entered inside with a permission from the watchman. A cop suddenly came from behind and caught hold of me. He grabbed me with his arm around my neck and held my right hand with his other hand as if he was shaking hands with me.\nHe smiled after holding me like this. His smile gave me the impression that I was not in trouble; that he would either ask me to go back to where I had been waiting or perhaps even take me to meet Medha (after all, he knew I was associated with her).\nThese thoughts, however, were short lived as he ordered someone to take my phone out of my pocket. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the point in protesting, as I was already encircled by a lot of police. I did not even bother to see who was taking out my phone from my pocket. By now I had accepted that I was in real trouble.\nImage Credit: Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\nThe cop took me to a place that appeared to be a lounge. All the visitors present in the area were asked to vacate the premises. More cops poured into the vacated area. I saw one constable with a lathi and I prepared myself for the ensuing event. Although I knew my pleas would be in vain, I still tried to tell the cops that I had come in just to use the washroom. After a while, the constable with the lathi went outside.\nFinally, the cop took his hands off me and made me stand to the side. He called two cops inside who were in civil dress. They were continuously staring at me. I thought they might thrash me. One of the two left and I was made to sit with another on a bench. This cop showed me the photographs of other colleagues of mine which he shot when we were giving bytes to the media. He started asking for their names. After a while, a constable came inside and informed that the jeep has arrived. I was made to sit in that.\nI saw the senior officials say something in the ears of those constables who were to accompany me to wherever they were taking me. I was driven to a far away police station; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even see the name of the police station.\nI had become upset by seeing the high-handedness in picking me up despite being innocent. I had stopped protesting or reacting and was just observing whatever was happening. I visit Mumbai\xe2\x80\x99s police stations very frequently and deal with top most cops with a sense of confidence while advocating on behalf of slum dwellers whenever there is a slum demolition but now all my confidence was gone and I felt betrayed.\nMy Muslim identity also added to my nervousness. I was not telling my full name to the cops and it was only after their insistence that I shared my surname. My politics, as well as my identity, made me feel more vulnerable because of atrocities that are generally faced by Muslims and activists in police custody.\nFinally, I entered the police station and immediately asked for three things: lawyer, water and bathroom. The first two demands were denied and for the third one, I was asked to use the toilet that was there in the lock-up. Then, the constable who had brought me from the hospital made me stand in front of a duty officer who asked for my name and address. He asked me where I had come from and why. I told him that I was from Mumbai and that I was associated with Medha Patkar and wanted to meet her. He hurled a filthy epithet at me and asked me to sit in a corner that was stinky and dirty after taking off my shoes.\nAfter a moment he called me and asked me to deposit all the money I had with me. I took out all the cash, counted, and gave it to him. Then another officer sitting in another corner asked that duty officer to not deposit the money with him. I found myself totally disconnected with the outside world without a phone and any access to a lawyer or a friend. No one would know where I was. I was missing now.\nWhat I was most worried about in the police station was my mother. I was wondering how my mother would react when she would not be able to contact me. She speaks with me on the phone every day and sometimes twice a day with some excuse, just to ensure that I am safe. Initially, she did not like my work. But later, when she realised that I was not leaving activism, she just asked me to not be on the frontlines of any action and warned me about possible threats. I have always defied her tactfully. I cannot imagine knowingly making her upset. My main worry was my mother \xe2\x80\x93 how would she react to the fact that I was missing.\nOne cop or another would come after regular intervals and ask for the same information again and again \xe2\x80\x94 my name and my residence. Every time, my answer was the same. After almost an hour, I could see the change in behaviour of the constables and they started treating me well. I was given a bottle of mineral water and asked if I wanted food. I took the water and thanked them for asking about food. After a while, the duty officer called for me and told me that I would be released after their senior officer came to the police station. He also gave me tea. I felt half relieved as I still did not trust them fully.\nBy then, I had been abducted and was missing for two hours. I thought of asking them about my release because the senior police officer did not seem to be coming. However, the trauma of my abduction had made me too upset to talk to anybody and risk anything happening to me. Injustice had already happened to me. Agitating against it would mean begging for justice. Finally, I was called and made to write and sign an apology letter for entering the hospital without permission. After I signed the letter, I was returned my phone and asked to go.\nI took an auto rickshaw and asked to get dropped at the Bombay hospital \xe2\x80\x94 from where I was abducted by the police \xe2\x80\x94 thinking that I would change route in case I found any danger. My concern about danger was confirmed as soon as I switched on my phone to talk to the local Indore supporters. I called our Indore supporter and informed him that I was coming to Bombay Hospital. He asked me to stay where I was and that he would come pick me up. I said I would come back on my own because I did not want to take the risk of being caught again by the police while waiting for him. I had received several calls from the police station to come back.\nThe moment I entered the hospital, I was encircled by a crowd which had come to demand my release. I was then immediately mobbed by the media asking for my byte. I did not receive any further calls from the police station as soon as I started appearing in the media. Every state news channel started claiming that it was due to the impact of their news that I was released. Soon, I received a call from a politician who asked about my well-being in order to convey that it was due to his influence that I reappeared.\nIn reality, local supporters Latika and Deepmala had created a buzz when I had gone missing. I had informed Latika when I left for the washroom in the hospital. I was also informed that a sympathetic former IG of Indore had also intervened to get me released. Probably the quick media campaign and the intervention of some influential persons was the reason behind the change of behaviour of the cops in the police station towards me.\nI saw our local Indore supporter being called by the cop who picked me up from the hospital. This cop was one of the top most cops of Indore, responsible for Medha Patkar\xe2\x80\x99s security in the Hospital. He went inside with this cop. This supporter is a well-known journalist and writer in Indore and he is also the father of the lawyer who was there in the hospital with us. Being an eminent citizen of Indore, this supporter had a limited entry to see Medha Patkar in the hospital whereas no politicians, including influential MLAs and MPs of major political parties, were allowed entry, no matter how much they protested.\nAfter a while, this supporter who had gone inside with the top cop and sat down with him in the hospital phoned his lawyer son and asked him to take me away from the hospital immediately. I am sure the supporter was told by the top cop to ask me to not appear in the media anymore and leave the hospital. The police were annoyed by my reappearance because the top cop had stated in the media that they had not abducted/arrested me and then I reappeared from the police station proving the Madhya Pradesh police department wrong. I remained underground the rest of the day based on advice from the local supporter.\nIt is indeed a rare stroke of luck that I reappeared. Otherwise, no one would have known what had happened to me. In the end, I just want to admit that I was seriously traumatised by this event but at no point did I think of stepping back. I will continue defying my mother tactfully!\nPS: I also want to greatly thank the journalist who saw me being picked up by the police and informed my colleagues.\n'

S' Faizabad: As Saryu flows 1 metre above the danger mark, its water has deluged the Vasudev Ghat cremation ground near Ram Janki Mandir in Ayodhya. Those coming from far-off places to cremate their near and dear ones in the temple town, are now immersing the bodies in the river, instead. \n  The Ghaghra river, which is termed Saryu when it passes Ayodhya, is flowing 95 centimetres above the danger mark are since water was released into it from the Banbasa dam in Nepal and the water has left thousands homeless in Faizabad, while acres of ready crops of sugarcane and rice are drowned. \n The flood water has entered temples in Ayodhya situated on the banks of the river. \n In Rudauli and Sadar tehsils of Faizabad, meanwhile, the flooded Ghaghra has inundated about a dozen villages. More than 1,000 residents of these villages have been shifted to relief camps set up on the premises of local government primary schools. \n Faizabad flood magistrate Manoj Singh told TOI, "We have evacuated about 1,000 flood victims and have sounded alert in areas where flood is likely to hit, in Rudauli, Sohawal and Sadar tehsils, while outposts have been set up for relief. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S'India will see the Solar Eclipse too, but it is believed to occur between 9:15PM to 2:34AM.\nToday is like the Super bowl of the Solar system in North America! On August 21, starting 2:45PM Eastern Time, all of North America will be treated to a total eclipse of the sun. This will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States in 38 years. Beside everyone in North America, parts of South America, Africa, and Europe will see at least a partial solar eclipse, while the thin path of totality will pass through portions of 14 states. Unfortunately, it will be a regular Monday morning in India, and other neighboring Asian countries. While the sun and moon will cross paths in the Indian skies too, it is estimated to last between 9.15PM to 2.34AM IST. Since the eclipse will occur during the night hours in India, experts believe it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any significant astrological impact.\nI am in the path of totality for the eclipse, how can I see it?\nI\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to go back to what you learnt in the Science lessons in class six. Staring at the Sun is bad for your eyes, especially during an eclipse. So, if you live in areas from where you can see a total or partial eclipse, better get in action immediately, and buy yourself a pair of solar filter sunglasses. These glasses block more than 99.99 percent of sunlight, as well as ultraviolet and infrared radiation. These glasses make the Sun appear as a muted orange or white disc in the sky. NASA and the American Astronomical Society have a list of manufacturers who make safe, standardized glasses for viewing the Sun. Be wary before purchasing your glasses on Amazon \xe2\x80\x94 not all manufacturers are selling products that are up to code.\nIs there any time I can look at this thing with my naked eyes?\nYes! Once the Sun is completely covered, those in the path of totality can take off their solar filter glasses and view the corona directly. But remember, totality is not going to last very long, so make sure to snap all your pics quickly, and just let the view soak in.\nCan the Solar eclipse damage my smartphone\xe2\x80\x99s camera lens too?\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to say for sure about this, same believe it could, but NASA says it\xe2\x80\x99s possible the lens is too small to be damaged by the Sun. But If you\xe2\x80\x99re really worried, you can put your solar filter glasses over the lens and take a picture of the eclipse that way. And during totality, you won\xe2\x80\x99t need any filter.\nAlthough, if you are really looking forward to snap a picture of the eclipse, smartphones may not be the best idea. They don\xe2\x80\x99t zoom in very far, and the Sun will look pretty small and grainy. Going for a DSLR camera may be a better way.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t live where the path of totality falls, how can I see the eclipse? Any live streams?\nOh yes, you can! NASA will be hosting an \xe2\x80\x9cEclipse Megacast\xe2\x80\x9d today, which will go on for about four hours. It will broadcast on NASA TV, YouTube, Twitter Periscope, and Facebook Live. The live stream will kick off at 12PM EDT, which is 9.30PM IST.\nExpect NASA to have some incredible shots of the eclipse. NASA says \xe2\x80\x9cviewers around the world will be provided a wealth of images captured before, during, and after the eclipse by 11 spacecraft, at least three NASA aircraft, more than 50 high-altitude balloons, and the astronauts aboard the International Space Station \xe2\x80\x93 each offering a unique vantage point for the celestial event.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOk I get all of that, but what is Solar Eclipse again?\nEssentially Solar eclipse is a celestial event in which the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, and blocks all or part of the sun for up to about three hours, from beginning to end, as viewed from a given location. You may be thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, the Moon is way smaller than the Sun. How can it cover it up?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, the Sun is roughly 400 times the size of the Moon, but the Moon is 400 times closer to Earth. So they appear about the same size in the sky. For this eclipse, the longest period when the moon completely blocks the sun from any given location along the path will be about two minutes and 40 seconds.\nOn the other hand, according to Hindu mythology, Solar and Lunar eclipse are associated with \xe2\x80\x9cSamudra Manthan\xe2\x80\x9d. There is an interesting tale behind it. Years ago, when the oceans churned, elixir was produced, which was stolen by the demons. To obtain the elixir, Lord Vishnu took incarnation of a beautiful damsel named Mohini, and tried to please and distract the demons. On receiving the elixir, Mohini came to the Gods to distribute it to them, when Rahu, one of the demons sat to obtain some portion of the elixir, the Sun and the Moon realized that Rahu was a demon and not one of the gods. Knowing this Mohini severed the head of Rahu, who still continued to live. And is believed to revenge the Moon and the Sun in the form of Solar and Lunar eclipse. Which is why according to Hindu Mythology, the radiations of Eclipse are a bad-omen as they are reflections of Rahu.\n'

S' According to the agency, over 11 million people have been affected by floods in four states across northern India\nA humanitarian crisis is unfolding across large areas in South Asia, with more than 16 million people affected by floods in Nepal, Bangladesh and India, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said on Friday.\nAccording to the agency, flood levels have already reached record highs in Bangladesh, and water of major rivers such as Jamuna has surpassed warning levels set in 1988, the deadliest flood in the country, Xinhua news agency reported.\n"This is fast becoming one of the most serious humanitarian crises this region has seen in many years and urgent action is needed to meet the growing needs of millions of people affected by these floods," an IFRC statement said, citing its staff for Asia Pacific region.\nAccording to the statement, more than one-third of Bangladesh and Nepal have been flooded, and the humanitarian crisis could get worse in the days and weeks ahead.\nMany areas in Nepal remain cut off after the floods and landslides, and many villages and communities are stranded without food, water and electricity, it said.  \n"This tragic flooding in Nepal has claimed at least 128 lives and 33 people are still missing," Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, Secretary General of the Nepal Red Cross Society, said.\nThe IFRC said over 3.9 million people were affected by the rising waters, and the situation was likely to get worse as swollen rivers from India poured into the low-lying and densely populated areas in Bangladesh.\nAccording to the agency, over 11 million people have been affected by floods in four states across northern India.\nThe India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy rains in the region in the coming days.\n'

S'Pay-per-click (PPC) is an internet advertising model you can use to send traffic to your small business website, to increase exposure and promote sales of your products and services. Employ it as part of an overall digital marketing strategy.\nWith PPC, you only pay when someone clicks an ad, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll know the exact return on your investment \xe2\x80\x94 something you won\xe2\x80\x99t get from offline advertising! The most popular types of PPC advertising are Google AdWords, Bing Ads, and Facebook Ads.\nThere are other benefits to using PPC as well:\nGet front-page search returns more quickly. Traditional search engine optimization (SEO) tactics can help your small business make it to Google\xe2\x80\x99s front page, but it takes time, particularly if there\xe2\x80\x99s stiff competition for the products or services you sell. Because you\xe2\x80\x99re paying for the privilege, PPC advertising can shorten that timeline drastically.\nControl the web pages people see. With traditional SEO, you can never be sure what pages will appear in search results. Using PPC, you decide which pages to direct searchers to.\nPPC improves organic search conversions. Studies show that PPC advertising can improve conversions from organic search. Also, the fact that Google and Bing now place ads at the top of search pages means organic returns are pushed down, further enhancing the need for PPC, to increase visibility.\nTarget only the customers you want to reach. With PPC, you decide who sees the ads based on behavioral, demographic, geographic, and device targeting options.\nSteps to set up a PPC advertising campaign\nIf investing in PPC sounds like an approach you\xe2\x80\x99d like to take, follow these steps to get started:\n1. Determine your goals\nDo you want to increase sales, sign-ups, or inquiries? Be certain about your goals before you start or you risk wasting money on a campaign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide a clear-cut path to ROI.\n2. Set a budget\nDeciding how much you can afford to spend is a vital initial step. There is no minimum investment so you can test the market with a small campaign and increase the amount as you see fit.\n3. Make a keyword list\nPPC ad platforms such as Google AdWords or Bing Ads rely on the use of keywords. Choosing the right keywords for your business is critical to your success. Tools like Google AdWords Keyword Planner or Wordtracker can help.\n4. Bid on keywords\nPPC advertising works like auctions in that you bid on the chosen keywords. That can be an expensive proposition depending on the competition for the same terms. Keyword Planner and another tool, SEMRush, can give you insights into what competitors are paying, enabling you to adjust your bid.\n5. Set up different keyword campaigns\nIf you use a mix of keywords for different products or services, divide them into separate campaigns, to make your targeting efforts more effective.\n6. Write keyword-optimized headlines and ad copy\nProspective customers utilize keywords in their search for the types of products and services you sell, so don\xe2\x80\x99t get too creative when writing headlines and body copy \xe2\x80\x94 opt for keywords instead. Next, focus on one or more distinct benefits and include a relevant call to action.\nHere are two examples of well-optimized ads from Google and Bing for the term \xe2\x80\x9ccatering services.\xe2\x80\x9d Note how each meets the criteria for headline and body copy.\n Recommended for You \n7. Create unique landing pages\nWhatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t send people to the homepage of your website. Rather, create a unique landing page that uses the same keywords as your ad.\nIf you sell products, send visitors to the product page associated with the ad. If you offer a service, create a page that outlines the benefits with a form where prospects can request more information or another call to action. (That\xe2\x80\x99s also a good way to get them into your sales funnel for follow-up marketing.)\nThis landing page, from Vistaprint, is a useful example. It\xe2\x80\x99s focused on a particular product, business cards, describes the benefits, and has a clear call to action (\xe2\x80\x9cGet started\xe2\x80\x9d).\nHow to set up a Google AdWords campaign\nGoogle AdWords is the first place many small businesses go to begin PPC advertising. Ads display in Google Search as well as on thousands of websites that incorporate Google Adsense ads as a revenue stream.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll use AdWords for this post to give you a better idea of how setting up a PPC campaign works. Just follow these simple steps:\nCreate a Google account. You need a Google account to use AdWords. If you use Gmail, for example, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken that step.\nGo to Adwords.Google.com and sign in. You will see the AdWords welcome screen. Click the \xe2\x80\x9cStart Now\xe2\x80\x9d button to continue. Google redirects you to a page that asks for your email and website address. Fill in that information and click the \xe2\x80\x9cContinue\xe2\x80\x9d button to proceed.\nComplete the form to set up your first campaign.\nGoogle asks you to:\nSet your budget \xe2\x80\x93 budgets are based on daily rate;\nChoose your target audience \xe2\x80\x93 define the location, network options (Google Search, Google Display Network), and keywords (Google even helps you out by suggesting recommended keywords.);\nSelect the bid amount \xe2\x80\x93 Google will set the amount automatically to ensure you get the most clicks for your budget. (You can set the bid manually if you choose.);\nWrite the text ad \xe2\x80\x93 insert the URL of the landing page, two headlines, a short description, and the option to enable phone calls from the ad. Click \xe2\x80\x9cSave and continue\xe2\x80\x9d once you\xe2\x80\x99ve completed the form;\nAdd your payment info \xe2\x80\x93 Google takes you to the billing page where you can add your payment information. Click \xe2\x80\x9cFinish and create ad\xe2\x80\x9d to complete the setup.\nYour AdWords campaign is ready to go!\nBing and Facebook offer similar setup options for first campaigns. Go to Bing.com/Ads and Facebook.com/Ads to start.\nPPC advertising can give your small business website the exposure it needs to help you sell more of your products and services. You retain complete control over the budget and bid amounts, so you know exactly how your money is being spent. Start with a small campaign, to test the market, and see how well this approach works for you.\nFor more basics on promoting your small business online, browse the other Digital Marketing Guides on this blog.\n'

S'Actor-model Anjali Anand said plus-size people are still not accepted by the entertainment and glamour industry.\nAnjali, who walked the ramp for the all Primero collection by Wendell Rodricks at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, said initially in her career, she faced a lot of difficulty to find work.\n"It is a sad thing that we don\'t have plus size models in India. Plus size people don\'t get work in modelling or acting as much as normal people do. Finding work in glamour industry is tough.\n"When I started modelling as a plus size, I always thought I will not get the job in this country. People saw me on the posters and were shocked. It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster.\n"I feel we should be happy about what we are. We have to be comfortable in whatever we are wearing," she said.\nThe actor, however, is happy that the mindset is slowly changing and things have become better for her post her TV show Dhhai Kilo Prem.\n"People\'s view is changing. I did modelling and then did a show and now people have started looking at me differently. It motivates me."\nRodricks\' collection was a rule breaker starting with the colours -- white, which has been taboo for too long where plus sizes are concerned.\nThen it was neutrals, grey and clothes with great volume.\nThe designer said he has always designed for voluptuous women as he believes it is unfair to ignore a major section of the society just because they don\'t fit in the "perfect body" bracket.\n"We have plus size concept all over the world but nothing was there for Indian women. We wanted to create something for Indian women. Plus size women feel they are completely out of the purview of the fashion.\n"60 per cent of the population falls in this category, so we tried to break the myth.\n"For me that was a personal accomplishment of sorts. This was the real show for me, this was the best show for me."\nVaronica Campabell, India\'s first transgender plus size model walked for the show along with 20 other plus size models, who were selected through an audition held in June.\nWhile the women\'s wear was a kaleidoscope of colours and included layered tunics, asymmetric gowns, swinging dresses, capes and kaftans, the menswear featured deconstructed plackets, mull bundies, tunics, and twill cotton.\nThe lycra shirts with contrast stitch details, poly knits, silver speck foil prints, crush pleated poly georgette and pewter shine stripes completed the extensive fabrics and detailing choices.\nPhotograph: Kind courtesy Lakme Fashion Week\n'

S'Here\xe2\x80\x99s why women need to buy a separate health insurance.\n Women are the pillar of a family. From being a humble housewife to a confident professional to a loving mother, a woman plays multiple role in a society. Today\xe2\x80\x99s women are all-rounders or we can say are \xe2\x80\x98doing-it-all\xe2\x80\x99. But in midst of taking care of everyone, have they forgotten themselves?\n Although, diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, polycystic ovaries, female sexual arousal disorder, cardiovascular and thyroid diseases are on a rise in women, when it comes to buying health insurances, women are still lagging behind. As per the IRDA Insurance Awareness Survey Report, 2012 merely 39% of total women have opted out for health policy and out of these only 22% have their own health insurance plan whereas the rest depend upon the policies bought by their fathers or husbands.\n  There are a number of factors contributing to this, but one major factor is the lack of awareness in women. There are good number of insurance plans covering maternity and female specific health problem expenses. However, the takers are very few due to the lack of awareness. Moreover, as women are charged more than men, because they utilise more medical services than men due in part to longer life expectancies, greater likelihood of chronic disease and disability, and the need for reproductive care, many women prefer getting included in their husband\xe2\x80\x99s or father\xe2\x80\x99s insurance. \n  Thus, here\xe2\x80\x99s why women need to buy a separate health insurance:\nSedentary lifestyle and critical diseases\n As women age, their health needs and coverage utilization also changes. The main culprit is the sedentary lifestyle, owing to which not only have women health issues escalated but also have become more complex in nature. Potential health risks are high in women, right from cardiovascular diseases, heart ailments to breast cancer, osteoporosis. Thus, having the right health insurance is important, so that however critical the illness is, one\xe2\x80\x99s financial independence remains unaffected.\n One of the major reason for every women to have a separate health insurance is the rising cost of medical treatment of the mostly occuring women diseases in India such as endometriosis, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis with pathological fracture, polycystic ovarian syndrome and uterine fibroids.\n Unsurprisingly, these diseases affect women of all ages but their severity increases with increase in the age. Thus, it is important for women to financially secure their future.\nMaternity benefit and health insurance\n Motherhood holds a special significance in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life. In the present scenario, the event of childbirth has also become an expensive affair. The fact that more and more couple are opting for Caesarian section as opposed to the normal delivery; ratio rate now stands to 65:35. This has led to the rise in treatment costs.\n In India, maternity insurance is not an exclusive insurance product, rather it is offered as an additional benefit to its loyal customers and one can claim maternity benefits only after 3-6 years of buying and renewing the policy. \n Buying a health insurance isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about protecting yourself, it is also about investing in yourself. We invest in things that are important to us like our education, family and home. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t health the most important, since we require a sound health to take advantage of the great things coming in the future. Make sure you have a health insurance that covers all your needs.\n'

S' The woman, however, retracted a month after the incident saying she had neither been raped by him nor chopped off his genitals in revenge \nThe woman had earlier said that she acted in self-defense after the swami had tried to rape her.\nThiruvananthapuram : The 54-year-old swami, whose genitals were allegedly slashed with a knife by a young woman a few months ago, has been granted bail by the Kerala High Court. The 23-year-old woman who had earlier alleged that she chopped off his genitals in anger for raping her several times in the past and attempting to rape her again on the day the incident happened, had retracted a month later saying she had neither been raped by him nor chopped off his genitals in revenge. \n "There has been no form of sexual harassment by the swami towards me. Neither when I was a minor nor after I turned 18. These accusations made against the swami are false, and are additions made by the police," the law student wrote in a letter released to the media.\nShe had also alleged that the police had forced her to comply with their altered version which she "could not read as she doesn\'t know how to read Malayalam".\n After her retraction, a lower court in Thiruvananthapuram had ordered the woman to take a lie detection test along with brain mapping, but woman has not consented for the same.\n In May, Swami Gangeshananda had to be operated on after his genitals were allegedly slashed with a knife. The woman had then told the police that she attacked the swami in self-defence after he had tried to rape her at her home. He was reportedly a frequent visitor to her home as a spiritual guru to her family.\n'

S'There\'s no shame if your wine expertise goes as far as knowing how to drink a glass, but it does help to know a few basic tips. From opening to pouring and storing your favorite bottle of wine, these tips will ensure you have the best wine-drinking experience possible, and they just might fool people into thinking you\'re a sommelier on the side. Get ready to discover the answers to all your burning questions ahead, and cheers yourself for becoming a total pro. \n 1. Save the cork to preserve an opened bottle. \nWhile some experts claim an open bottle of wine should be consumed within that day, it\'s possible to save the bottle for another few days. All you need to keep an open bottle of wine fresh is the cork it came with. You don\'t need any fancy bottle stoppers or tools; just push the cork as far back into the bottle as you can, and put it in the fridge (red or white).\n 2. Check to see if your wine has gone bad. \nIf an opened bottle of wine has sat on your counter for too long, there\'s a chance it\'s gone bad and will taste terrible. To check to see if your wine has gone bad, smell it (it shouldn\'t smell musty whatsoever), taste it (if red wine tastes as sweet as dessert wine, it has been overexposed to heat), check the cork (it shouldn\'t be slightly pushed out of the bottle), inspect the color (make sure red wine doesn\'t have a brownish hue), look for chemically flavors (time to toss), and see if it\'s fizzy (unless it\'s a sparkling wine, it shouldn\'t be).\n 3. Chill wine for the best flavor. \nWhile it\'s common practice to serve white wines chilled and red wines at room temperature, chilling all types of wine can actually make it taste better. Chilling a red wine can mellow out some of the harshness and bring out the best flavors.\n 4. Keep the pour to three fingers\' worth. \nThere are some days when you feel like pouring wine to the very top of the glass, but for flavor\'s sake, don\'t! A three-finger pour is the perfect amount of wine for optimal flavor and aeration, according to sommeliers. Plus, this allows you to swirl your wine in the glass and makes you look like a serious expert.\n 5. Open a bottle without a wine opener. \nIf you don\'t have a wine opener nearby, don\'t sweat it. There\'s a genius hack that allows you to open a bottle of wine with a key, and it really works!\n 6. Save a spoiled bottle with a penny \xe2\x80\x94 literally. \nThe trick to saving a spoiled bottle of wine costs exactly one cent. According to the American Chemical Society, you should drop a penny (after thoroughly cleaning it, of course) into a glass of wine, stir it around, take it out, and voil\xc3\xa0! Your bad wine should taste good.\n 7. The most expensive bottle doesn\'t always taste better. \nThere\'s a study that suggests the reason more expensive wine tastes better is all in your head; in other words, the placebo effect changed some people\'s minds when they tasted the same wine labeled at different prices. So if you\'re staring at a $6 bottle of Cabernet and an $11 bottle struggling which one to choose, opt for the less-expensive one, because in the end, they probably taste similar.\n 8. Don\'t brush your teeth immediately after finishing a glass. \nIt might sound weird, but you should wait about an hour after drinking wine to brush your teeth. The reason is that brushing teeth after sipping wine can damage tooth enamel since wine \xe2\x80\x94 especially white wine \xe2\x80\x94 has high levels of acidity.\n 9. Become a wine person by keeping a journal. \nNot into wine, no matter how many times your friends have tried to convert you? That\'s totally OK! But if you want to become a "wine person" and learn what kinds of wine you truly prefer, keep a wine journal with notes every time you taste a wine, and write down the exact name. That way, you\'ll remember what you liked (or didn\'t like) about the last Pinot Noir or Chardonnay you tried, and you\'ll slowly start to figure out your favorites.\n'

S'In Uttar Pradesh no let up in flood fury as raging waters of the rivers caused havoc in vast swathes of human habitation in eastern and tarai regions of the State.\nOver 20 lakh people have been hit by the floods in 24 districts of the state. Relief Commissioner of the State has said that the death toll in the floods has reached 69. Above 2,500 villages are flooded affecting a population of over 20 lakh. About 40000 persons have take shelter in relief camps in the affected districts. 20 companies of the NDRF, 29 companies of PAC along with two choppers of the Indian Air Force and several columns of the Army personnel were on job to save lives and properties in the affected areas.\nRiver Sharda was flowing above the danger mark at Palia Kalan in Lakhimpur Kheri while Ghaghra was flowing above the red mark at Barabanki, Ayodhya and Ballia. River Rapti was also flowing well above the red mark at Balrampur, Basti, and Gorakhpur, while Budhi Rapti was above the danger level at Siddharth Nagar rivers Rohin and Quano are flowing above danger mark at Mahrajganj and Gonda districts.\nRelease of water in the rivers emanating from Nepal and incessant rains impeded rescue work and evacuation of people to safer areas. Road transport in flood affected areas is badly affected and thousand of people have taken shelter at railway tracks in different districts. \n'

S' \'I can go outside and be comfortable,\' said Sanya Malhotra \nSanya Malhotra made her Bollywood debut with Dangal (courtesy sanyamalhotra)\nStory Highlights\n \'I am still the same,\' said Sanya \n \'I can go outside and be comfortable,\' she added \n \'I am not that fashion conscious,\' she said \nNew Delhi: Actress Sanya Malhotra, who made her Bollywood debut with Aamir Khan\'s 2016 blockbuster Dangal, opened up about life after her maiden Bollywood film in an interview with news agency IANS. Sanya and Fatima Sana Shaikh starred as sisters in the Nitesh Tiwari-directed wrestling drama. Following Dangal, Fatima has another Aamir Khan project in the pipeline but Sanya, who\'s not announced a new film yet, told IANS that she is not perturbed by her sudden popularity. When asked if being a celebrity made her consider making wardrobe changes IRL, Sanya said: "Actually not. I am still the same. I can go outside and be comfortable. I don\'t say that I don\'t care, but its fine if I am going out in shorts. I am not that fashion conscious," reported IANS.\n The actress was speaking on the side-lines of Lakme Fashion Week (Winter/Festive collection), where she show-stopped for apparel label The Meraki Project.\n#LakmeFashionWeek Winter/Festive 2017 presents @themerakiproject at the #6DegreeStudio @6degreeplatform #5DaysOfFashion\nA post shared by Lakme Fashion Week (@lakmefashionwk) on Aug 16, 2017 at 5:38am PDT\n Walking the ramp was also a first for Sanya, who shared her experience of show-stopping and said: "It was quite fun and I was really excited. I loved the stage and I loved performing on stage. After so many years, I got the opportunity to walk the ramp and this was the first time I was walking the ramp. I was really excited and I said, \'I have to do it\'."\n When asked about her upcoming roster, Sanya did reveal that "there are a few projects" in consideration but the details better remain under wraps for now. "I don\'t want to talk about it right now," said Sanya.\n Sanya Malhotra featured as the younger one of the two Phogat sisters in Dangal, which is based on the life of Haryanvi wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, Dangal released on Christmas last year and is the highest earning Bollywood movie.\n (With IANS inputs)\n'

S'REUTERS - Former England manager Steve McClaren has agreed to join Israel\'s Maccabi Tel Aviv as a coaching consultant to new manager Jordi Cruyff, the Israeli Premier League club said on Monday.\n McClaren coached England for 16 months from 2006 before being sacked following the team\'s failure to qualify for the 2008 European Championships. He also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United.\n"I have huge respect for such a well known club both in Israel and in Europe and I intend to help Jordi and the players achieve success for the fans this season," McClaren told Tel Aviv\'s website.\nThe 56-year-old previously worked with Cruyff at Manchester United where McClaren was assistant manager under Alex Ferguson from 1999-2001 while Cruyff played for the Premier League club.\nMcClaren also coached Dutch side FC Twente in two separate spells from 2008-10, leading them to the Dutch league title in 2010, and from 2012-13, where he resigned after a year due to poor performances that led to widespread criticism from fans.\n(Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru)\n(This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto\xe2\x80\x93generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)\n'

S'1. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give us unsolicited advice.\nLike Erykah Badu said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an artist and I\xe2\x80\x99m sensitive about my shit.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTaking one art class in middle school or college has somehow made everyone an expert on how we should art. Which is ironic, considering our constant dissatisfaction with the art we create.\nMany artists envision our creations in a perfect world, and we spend countless hours trying to replicate this imagined perfection with our imperfect tools and bodies.\nOftentimes, this quest for perfection can lead to perpetual feelings of inadequacy and discontent with ourselves. It can be difficult to separate the art we create from who we are, and your criticisms of our art often feel like criticisms of our person.\nYou may not be aware of how much time we already spend in self-critique, while others of us have learned to detach from the criticism our creations to preserve our sanity.\nArt life may look easy, but the path of an art professional is not clear-cut. Promoter, contract negotiator, publicist, social media strategist, booking agent are just some of the other roles we assume to manage the business of our creative side.\nWe always appreciate help, but please\xe2\x80\xa6 be cautious with your unsolicited feedback and criticisms. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing the best we can.\n2. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask us about our finances.\nWe know, we know. The general consensus is that making a living with art is not feasible. We grapple with this concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cstarving artist\xe2\x80\x9d constantly.\nSome of us even work side jobs, odd jobs, and full-time day jobs just to ensure that we can eat while still producing and creating, because creativity is what makes our lives livable. Trust us, we know money is important. Perhaps better than you do. \nYes, we know it\xe2\x80\x99s not the most stable way to live. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the first person to bring that to our attention.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an accomplishment every day to ignore our glaring need for financial security while balancing our need for creative expression.\nSo please, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re offering to be our patron like King Francis I of France did with Leonardo Da Vinci\xe2\x80\xa6 spare us that conversation and let us enjoy our overpriced grande soy latte in peace.\n3. Stop saying our art is a \xe2\x80\x9chobby.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis statement is completely dismissive and hurtful. There is a general lack of appreciation for what we do, and what makes us \xe2\x80\x9cus.\xe2\x80\x9d People think of art as frivolous, which may be why arts funding in public education is often under attack.\nWe may not be doctors and engineers, but our contribution to society is valid and important. Love fashion? Thank an artist. Enjoy listening to music on your drive to work? An artist. Love movies and TV shows? Yup, that\xe2\x80\x99s us. \nYour home d\xc3\xa9cor, your favorite food, the poems that you send your lover\xe2\x80\xa6all of this is us. We create those things that give color to your life. We remind you of the beauty of being human.\nArt has inspired revolutions, changed the ideologies of whole generations. We take our art seriously, and we think you should, too.\n4. Know that our relationship affects our art.\nArtists draw inspiration from everywhere. If we are close to you, there is a strong chance that you have and are informing our art in some way. This, in and of itself, is an act of love and appreciation.\nYou may be our muse, and our art becomes a living testament to our interactions. If you want to be memorialized, love an artist. Our art will love you back.\n5. Please do not glamorize our self-destructive habits.\nThe clich\xc3\xa9 of the tortured artist is harmful. Artists have a unique gift for feeling deeply and turning those emotions and experiences into pieces that reflect our inner worlds.\nThere is nothing artistic about struggling with crippling depression and anxiety \xe2\x80\x94 mental illnesses that can be horribly exacerbated by artist life of overnight fame, constant critique and rejection, and perpetual feelings of \xe2\x80\x9cnot-enoughness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n It is not uncommon for us to develop alcohol or drug addictions to cope with the pain of being human and the pain of being an artist. Although art can be born from our pain, we want to thrive artistically and emotionally as well.\nNotions such as \xe2\x80\x9csex, drugs, rock and roll\xe2\x80\x9d normalize our self-destructive behavior. When you glorify our pain and equate our suffering with our talent, it creates unhealthy attachments to experiences and behaviors that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be continued. Support our art by supporting our personal health and healing.\n6. Please understand our scatterbrained nature.\nCreatives can be completely scatterbrained. During a calm dinner, it may be hard for us to switch our brains off when a stroke of inspiration comes to us. We know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not convenient.\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also not inconvenient for us to have ideas swirling around in our heads at all times, and may take us quite some time to learn how to moderate our ideas while making space to stay present with our family and friends.\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t control when the next idea will hit us, but we are capable of loving and being present. We just may need extra help sorting through the cacophony of voices and overstimulation that is our brain.\n7. Please understand that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have time\xe2\x80\x9d is not an excuse.\nArt may not fit neatly into 9am to 5pm hours. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a remarkable thing when it does. But when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 yikes.\nOur schedules can be extremely variable and unpredictable. Sometimes we work hardly at all. Other times, we may make plans and cancel last minute because of a music gig, audition notice from an agent, or a quick turn-around commission piece.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not indicative of our appreciation for you, trust me. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that sometimes art employment is feast or famine, and we often are only as good as our next gig. So when it rains, we\xe2\x80\x99re out there with buckets because it may not rain again for us for quite some time.\nUnderstand that when it\xe2\x80\x99s go time\xe2\x80\xa6 we may disappear for a bit. Celebrate our new project with us; text us an encouraging word. Stop by with our favorite food (because it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that we may be burning the midnight oil and haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped to eat). I promise, when things let up, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing from us as if we never left.\n8. Love us like people.\nSome people have made dating or befriending an artist into a fetish. It may be trendy to date, say, a musician or actor, or have a BFF that is a muralist or art curator. But we\xe2\x80\x99re just people, too and we want to be loved for who we are.\nRegardless of how large our following or fan base is, the number of accolades we receive or do not receive, please treat us the same. We want to know that we have the freedom to be human and flawed, even though art notoriety often comes with a pedestal and the blinding light of public exposure and celebrity.\nAll people want to be accepted and loved authentically, not just for their light, but for their dark as well.\n9. Support us.\nWhen you can, support us monetarily. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay though if you can\xe2\x80\x99t. We know that you may not always have the money to support us, but there are other ways to spread your love for us.\nPromoting us to your network goes a long way. Come to our gigs and post about it. Watch our plays and TV shows. Come to our gallery opening, wear our products. Book us for your next birthday photo shoot. Read our latest writing. Write reviews for us.\nRecommend our work to your friends, strangers, co-workers, cousins. Tag us, re-post us, re-tweet us. Share our work! \nSend us opportunities that you think we would be a perfect fit for. You can act as a liaison for us in a myriad of ways that we cannot do for ourselves. Your support and voice may be the difference between us eating and not eating, or us securing our next dream job or gig.\n10. Give us space to NOT be an artist.\nSometimes, we are so completely done with art and everything art-related. When we reach the point of saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done with this completely\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done with this today,\xe2\x80\x9d make space for our feelings of art fatigue.\nSometimes, we just want to exist in the world without the pressure of creating or improving; of working or worrying about needing more work. Sometimes, we just need to enjoy being alive and recharge. \nThis may be a daily need to have conversations about non-art related topics, a spontaneous excursion, time to connect with our loved ones, or space to be quiet and alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a help when our loved ones allow us space to be and encourage us to remember self-care.\nRespect our need to distance from the art world. Have compassion when we say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about art. Just be there with us, in the moment.\nBeing an artist can be a blessing and burden for ourselves and those who love us. If you have patience and compassion, loving an artist can truly be a life-changing experience. \nGive your artist friends and family a hug. They need it.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re currently loving an artist, thank you. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re not, find an artist to love today. \n'

S'Mumbai: Looking at the steady increase in tourists arrivals from India, Israel is eyeing one lakh Indian travellers to visit the country by the next year.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been very focused in tourism promotions in India and easing the visa process. This year in the first seven months till July we have already hosted 34,000 Indian tourists. This is expected to go up to 55,000 by the end of this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Israel Ministry of Tourism India Director Hassan Madah told PTI here.\nHe said, currently there are 3-4 direct flights from Mumbai to Tel Aviv and numerous connecting flights from the Middle East.\nThere are talks of introducing direct Air India flights connecting New Delhi with Israel in a few months, he said adding if it commences then the tourist traffic is likely to surge from India and the number this year may reach nearly 90,000.\nThere are few global airlines, who are waiting for the Air India flights to be launched, and then introduce their fleets in this direct route.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen this happens, we will see a surge in tourists arrivals from India. We have also been engaging with the tourism industry in India since last few years and are focused in many promotional activities. Due to this we have set a target of reaching one lakh tourists from India by the end of 2018,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nFor tourism promotions in India, Israel Ministry of Tourism (IMOT) is spending USD 5-6 million in India this year, he said adding going forward as the tourist traffic grows the Budget is likely to grow.\nIsrael, which has positioned its self as an affordable premium destination, is targeting travellers mainly for pilgrimage, leisure and meetings, incentives, conferences, events (MICE), including weddings, segments.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are mainly focusing on pilgrimage, leisure and MICE as they are huge segments in India. However, we also have scope for the young adventurer at heart, honeymoon and for medical purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nIn India, IMOT is targeting people from the metro cities mostly from over 25 years who are well travelled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cInitially, we want to focus in the big and metro cities. Gradually, we will expand our promotions to tier II and III cities,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\nMadah said initially in Asia, India was the number one source market for Israel, however, China has now taken over the position.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that after the connectivity improves, India will again become number one source market for us among the Asian countries,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nGlobally, the US and Europe, including Russia are the top source markets of Israel.

S"Berlin, Aug 21 (PTI) Wondering how you would look wearing your favourite celebrity's outfits? Scientists have developed a new four-dimensional (4D) scanning system that can capture clothing on moving \nBerlin, Aug 21 (PTI) Wondering how you would look wearing your favourite celebrity\xe2\x80\x99s outfits? Scientists have developed a new four-dimensional (4D) scanning system that can capture clothing on moving people, turn it into a 3D digital form and dress your virtual avatars.\nThe virtual \xe2\x80\x98try-on\xe2\x80\x99 system, called ClothCap, can see how the fabric moves and how it fits before a person buys an outfit, researchers said.\nTraditional virtual clothing try-on involves getting the 2D clothing pattern from the manufacturer, sizing this to a body, and simulating how the clothing drapes on the body.\nThe new technique replaces garment simulation with garment capture. Capturing and transferring existing garments to new people greatly simplifies the process of virtual try- on.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur approach is to scan a person wearing the garment, separate the clothing from the person, and then rendering it on top of a new person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gerard Pons-Moll, research scientist at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in Germany.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis process captures all the detail present in real clothing, including how it moves, which is hard to replicate with simulation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pons-Moll.\nClothCap uses 4D movies of people recorded with a unique 4D high-resolution scanner.\nThe system uses 66 cameras and projectors to illuminate the person being scanned.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis scanner captures every wrinkle of clothing at high resolution. It is like having 66 eyes looking at a person from every possible angle. This allows us to study humans in motion like never before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Black, director at MPI-IS.\nClothCap computes the body shape and motion under clothing while separating and tracking the garments on the body as it moves.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe software turns the captured scans into separate meshes corresponding to the clothing and the body,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergi Pujades, postdoctoral researcher at MPI.\nClothCap provides a foundational technology for virtual clothing try-on.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst a retailer needs to scan a professional model in a variety of poses and clothing to create a digital wardrobe of clothing items. Then a user can select an item and visualise how it looks on their virtual avatar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Black.\n"

S"The front glass doors of the BP in Horotiu were smashed by four robbers armed with a metal bar.\nStaff at a Waikato petrol station have resorted to parking their own car in front of the glass doors in an attempt to stop ram raiders. \nBut that didn't deter four disguised robbers who used a metal bar to smash into the BP at Horotiu in the early hours of Tuesday morning. \nIt is the third time this year the service station off the Waikato Expressway has been robbed. \nStaff say they have all of the security measures in place - CCTV cameras, extra lighting, locked doors and panic alarms.\nOne staff member was working the graveyard shift when the foursome wearing caps and gloves, forced their way in around 4.30am. \nThey took the cash trays from the till and cigarettes before fleeing in a vehicle, believed to be a station wagon, a police spokesperson said. \nWaikato police Senior Sergeant Ray Malcolmson said a vehicle possibly linked to the robbery was located on a road nearby. \nIt had been seized by police for testing. \nIn March three men armed with screwdrivers robbed the same service station taking cash and cigarettes. \nAnd in July it was struck again when two people shielded in dark clothing smashed through the front glass doors at midnight on a Monday night. \nA sole attendant was present in the station but was out in a back office when the thieves stormed in and stole cash and cigarettes. \nAnyone who saw anything suspicious or has information can call Hamilton police on 07 858 6200. \nInformation can also be left anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. \n  - Stuff \n"

S'To raise the issue of children\'s safety in school premises, Andheri residents on Sunday held a protest march at the Lokhandwala Backroad. Over 250 parents from Lokhandwala, Oshiwara and neighbouring areas joined the rally.\nFollowing a case where a peon at a school in Malad East was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl in the school\'s toilet, Andheri residents started an online petition on change.org. The petition had received more than 1,500 signatures so far.\nParents said there was a need to forward and raise a voice against the increasing instances of questionable security of children in schools.\nFounder of Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens Association (LOCA) Dhaval Shah, who started the online petition, said, "We have around 12 schools in the neighbourhood. We will be meeting the school authorities one by one to discuss safety issues. Since the last few years, we have been hearing about many cases of security lapses in schools. Other schools should learn from such incidents and come up with better security."\nAnother LOCA member, Surjeet Singh Dadiala said, "We need the schools to have a set of norms regarding the security. Schools should be held accountable rather than the authority covering up the issue. The government should come up with rules and regulations that need to be audited regularly. A memorandum will be submitted Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis regarding new regulations for schools in terms of security measures."\nOn August 9, the Dindoshi police arrested a peon at an ICSE school in Malad East for allegedly sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl in the school\'s toilet on four consecutive days since August 1. The incident sparked major protests by parents in Malad.\nON THE AGENDA\nThe residents started the online petition on August 13. Over 1,500 citizens have signed the online petition. They are calling for more signatures \nThe residents plan to meet Education Minister Vinod Tawade or CM Devendra Fadnavis and raise their concerns\n'

S' Paul, who died on August 16, was one of the founding fathers of Indian photojournalism. \nRitesh Uttamchandani\nBased on where you stand and how you look at it, the world seems either extremely messed or painfully beautiful. \nI am currently smack in the middle of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a pretty sight, but I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved to have been touched by its beauty. For five whole days. \nThey came to me from the master, who unlike others, never called himself a master. \nA photographer.\nLess of a photographer and more of a craftsman on some days and more a student than a master on most, yet beautifully flawed like you and me. \nA human. \nMore than a year after we met first met in 2014, he phoned me one afternoon and in a nervous voice, asked a question many uncles and aunties had asked me on long train journeys: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you married?\xe2\x80\x9d \nA little taken aback and mildly amused, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you interested?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\nI said I could think about it and asked him if he has anyone in mind. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI know someone. When you come to Delhi, I will introduce you to her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nLetting the light in\nI must confess I know very little about S Paul. I doubt anyone besides his immediate family can claim to know him. People often described him as difficult, temperamental, angry and reclusive. Others said his work was too scattered \xe2\x80\x93 there are too many singles and no concise body of work or a theme connecting them all. \nThese are short-sighted readings at best, because just like with the world, the perspective entirely depends on where you stand and how you look at him.\nThere remains no doubt about his mastery of the craft. People complain that there is a disturbing lack of evidence of that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-way street and I wonder: what stops viewers from being curious and seeking S Paul? Look around \xe2\x80\x93 if not his work, you can easily find traces of him in other people\xe2\x80\x99s work, in your own lives\nThe defining qualities of his photos are his childlike curiosity and instinct. The other qualities that set him apart were his preparedness and rigour. Like Bill Cunningham, or Vivian Maier, Paul was rarely seen without a camera. Irrespective of the weather, he would be out taking photos. \nThe tool that Paul used to draw out the responses built inside the intersection of his brain, heart and the outside world was always on his shoulder or around his neck, as though the camera was just another part of his body. When the heat was bearable, he often wore a suit, making him undoubtedly one of the most dapper looking photographers in India.\nPhoto credit: Ritesh Uttamchandani\nMy knowledge of the craft is too pedestrian to talk much about his photographs. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been through the kind of chiseling that he or his favourite contemporary, Kishor Parekh, had. But, one has to be made of stone to not notice how relateable his photos are, how infinitely simple. \nAnother striking photograph is My Wife Sinder.\nIn 1966, he entered a photo of an elephant and his mahout walking on a Delhi street in the annual World Press Photo contest. Back then, the contest had only one winner in each category and his photograph came a close second. If they had a three-tier ranking system as they have now, the honour of being India\xe2\x80\x99s first World Press Photo award winnder would have been his. \nAn undiluted simplicity is the most endearing quality of his photographs. He sometimes made cryptic photos like the one of a dead tree branch, shot from an angle that made it seem like a bird picking twigs to build a nest. There\xe2\x80\x99s very little nonsense when it came to Paul and a man of that nature is bound to have a low tolerance for bullshit from others too. You can mistake it for arrogance, difficulty, being a recluse or indifference, depending on where you stand and how you look at it.\nLike many of my generation, we never saw him work a scene, but from descriptions by others, he was, as they say in jazz circles, a cat.\nAs tall as Paul \nI first met him to profile him for the magazine Open, in 2014. During our meeting, which lasted a good seven or eight hours, he leaped from one topic to another. He opened books, brochures, award citations, letters and one exhibition catalogue, and reminisced about them all. He showed me a tiny sepia-tinted book, which had a cryptic set of macro shots, about the study of scale and perspective. The photos had a freestyle text running alongside with the title: As Tall As Paul.\nAs he unveiled himself, I remember wishing I had someone along to record this on video. I wish I had just set up my cell phone on video mode. I wish I could pull my weight and make him understand how important his words are and what a great gift it would be for future generations if he would just let me record our chat.\nOn my way back, while I was on Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s Nizamuddin Bridge, he called to tell me that he had changed his mind and was not interested anymore in being profiled. I felt like leaping into the frothing river below, but I muscled up and played a few emotional cards. He changed his mind and agreed only on one condition, that I send him a draft based on that day\xe2\x80\x99s material. It was yet another test, like that give and take that parents put children through often. I saw through it and gave him a draft. We were back on track.\nHe was a different man the next day, a little more welcoming, a lot more well rested and wanted to waste no time sitting indoors. So we walked around. A group of kids flung balloons at him, he knew that they did so only because he had a camera in his hand. He reprimanded them, but kept his camera in his bag and walked ahead. Once in the safe zone, his camera was cupped in his giant palm again. As he took photos of a broken piece of glass, I tried to photograph him. He sensed what I was aiming for and quietly, without my prodding, moved a little to his left. His reflection on the glass entered my frame and his body moved out of it. As we walked on, he hummed the first four lines of his favourite song Saawan Ke Baadlon. \nWhen we were sitting in the park in Surya Nagar, I had asked him about the title conferred on him by a magazine \xe2\x80\x93 The Henri Cartier Bresson of India. I had a feeling that he did not enjoy the title much and insisted on being called the S Paul of India, if referred to as anything apart from his name. Most of us would kill to be compared with a photographer of Besson\xe2\x80\x99s scale, but not Paul. He was well aware of Bresson\xe2\x80\x99s genius and and felt he did not match up to it. Bresson travelled the world, while for Paul, his neighbourhood was his world. Bresson shot with a Leica all his life, while Paul was happiest in the company of a new lens, a new camera. All one had to do keep him busy was introduce him to new gear \xe2\x80\x93 in many ways he was a lot like the genius child in school classrooms who could knock off the most complicated problems in a jiffy.\nIf a comparison must be made, the closest would probably be Eugene Smith\xe2\x80\x99s years of photographing the outside world from the confines of his loft or Winogrand\xe2\x80\x99s rigour. Paul wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully exposed to both photographers but used to see their work often in the second-hand magazines he would purchase from the streets of Old Delhi. Yet again, he was aware of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s stature and Winogrand\xe2\x80\x99s grungy aesthetic and rubbished the comparison. He liked the sound of Paul Sahab though, a title that probably originated either at home or during his years of government service or from the mouths of the many men and women he mentored.\nOn paper \nA few weeks went by and our editor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I would ever turn in the story. So much information, yet it still seemed so little. My friends helped me out, my colleagues slaved over it and I finally cracked the first draft. \nMy editor was furious with the draft. He hated it and accused me of having an agenda. I had quoted him on some topics that, in retrospect, I realise he probably told me in confidence, as though I were his buddy. And there I was, a photographer with no previous experience of a long form story of this nature, having being asked to redo it all. I am also someone from a newspaper background, where we were conditioned to spend all our day looking for that one photo, that one moment that will edge the others out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to offer options and this dented my morale considerably.\nThe final draft, the ninth one, was about 9,000 words and a senior colleague, Madhavankutty Pillai, shocked by the length, ran his scissors over the piece and reduced it to half \xe2\x80\x93 removing major chunks of Paul Sahab\xe2\x80\x99s personal life. He relented and allowed me 500 more words. The story was eventually published across four spreads, and anyone who works in a magazine would know how prime that real estate is.\nMuch has been made or unmade of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with his brother, Raghu Rai. As outsiders, we will never know much and it should not concern us. Our take away, if we have learnt anything from the two great minds of photography in India, is that we must not be swayed by their personal lives.\nA year after the publication of the story, we hung out again at his house, it was a humid Delhi monsoon day in August 2015, his birthday.\nHe showed me more photos, books and magazines and was disappointed at how fake and fragile the photography community in India had become. He expressed deep regret and concern at the way increasing gatekeeping in the industry and the lazy nexus between curators and some artists and how the focus was more on the projection of one\xe2\x80\x99s own image than one\xe2\x80\x99s photographs. He also wished to meet Reza Deghati, whom I had met earlier that year in Mumbai. Reza too wanted to meet him, but while he was in Delhi, Paul was out of the city. I can\xe2\x80\x99t recall the destination, but I was happy to hear that he was finally travelling.\nOn my way out on that August morning he offered me sweets. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat any himself. While keeping the plate back on the table, he miscalculated the distance and his long hand knocked down a glass. Paul Sahab\xe2\x80\x99s wife and a domestic worker came running and asked us to vacate the room. The master had an embarrassed smile on his face but forgot about it once we sat near the window.\nNot a big fan of cellphone photography, after some more emotional blackmail, he agreed to let me shoot some iPhone portraits of him. He also let me record two small videos of him, only after I assured him of one thing. As desired, I promised him that while he was alive, I would not show them to anyone, post them on any public platform or share them with any TV channels. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, you can surely show it wherever you wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nI jokingly asked him for an unequal promise in return. That he publish a photo book \xe2\x80\x93 a memoir or a mammoth volume of books \xe2\x80\x93 of his finest photographs and his stories.\nHe laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cJald hi [soon], only if you promise to help me with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'Twitter and other social media platforms can help track natural disasters in real time and alert first responders of the areas that need urgent aid, scientists say. \n  With over 500 million tweets sent every single day, new research is investigating innovative ways to use that data to help communities respond during unexpected catastrophes. (Reuters) \nTwitter and other social media platforms can help track natural disasters in real time and alert first responders of the areas that need urgent aid, scientists say. With over 500 million tweets sent every single day, new research is investigating innovative ways to use that data to help communities respond during unexpected catastrophes. While local governments and relief organisations can measure a community\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond to a disaster or measuring its impacts after, they can not monitor the effects in real time.\nResearchers from the Pennsylvania State University in the US demonstrated the ability of social media to alert first responders.\nThey compared tweets sent out during Hurricane Sandy, one of the deadliest hurricanes to ever hit the US, and the corresponding power outage information provided after the incident by utility companies in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nBy comparing the information drawn from the power grid and the human chatter from over 10 million relevant posts on Twitter, the team was able to create a system for event detection.\nThen, by isolating tweets with the terms \xe2\x80\x98power,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98outage,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98electri,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98utility,\xe2\x80\x99 the posts were organised by hour and compared to the outage reports in the same timeframe.\nThe two data sets were found to have a moderate-to-strong correlation, and the team believes it is possible that Twitter was able to report power outages more quickly. Previous academic research in the domain has primarily been before and after disastrous events.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to show these two data points actually relate to one another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nick Lalone, doctoral student and the principal investigator of the study published in the journal Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure. \xe2\x80\x9cThe goal of this research is to demonstrate that if the data stream changes, you can see what just happened. It would result in a real-time monitoring system,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lalone.\n'

S'Chennai: All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), CR Saraswathi of TTV Dhinakaran-VK Sasikala faction on Monday expressed unhappiness for being avoided during the merger of the EPS and the OPS factions.\n"We are so happy that the OPS faction and EPS faction has been merged, even we wanted that. But we are very sad, don\'t know why they want to avoid us," Saraswathi told ANI in Chennai.\nShe said that from day one Sasikala and TTV Dhinakaran wanted the merger of the party and everybody to come together once again and added that now they have been sidelined.\n"Chinamma appointed Edapaddi as the Chief Minsiter before going to jail. Billion Dollar question is why they want to avoid us. It\'s ok, time will answer for everything, people are with us. We believe that every soon they will come to us for the merger," she said.\nFormer Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam (OPS) took oath as the Deputy Chief Minister under the merged AIADMK government in the state.\nEarlier, in what can be dubbed as a political turnaround in a state that was embroiled in a political drama till not so long ago, the two warring factions of the AIADMK - one led by Chief Minister E. Palanisamy (EPS) and the other by OPS - announced a merger, citing that "MGR always wanted to see us united, not split."\nThe striking part of the merger is that EPS has taken a backseat in the party, declaring OPS as the convenor of the party. EPS will be the co-convenor.\nEPS will continue to be the chief minister of Tamil Nadu.\nEPS, while addressing a press briefing here, said that there will be 11 people in a committee to co-ordinate in the merger.\nThere was no mention of jailed AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala in the press statement.\n"We will get the party symbol back and will defeat the enemy. Jayalalithaa had said before that after me, the AIADMK will be there for 100 years. We all will make it sure," he added.\n"We all are children of one mother, and Amma (Jayalalithaa) is that one mother."\nEarlier, Panneerselvam had announced that the AIADMK would be one once again, while also adding that the Sasikala clan would not be a part of the party.\nThe OPS faction, despite welcoming the probe into Jayalalithaa\'s death, also contemplated on seeking the expulsion of jailed AIADMK general secretary Sasikala from the party as the final pre-requisite before joining hands with the EPS camp.\nThe formal expulsion of jailed party general secretary and her kin, including deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran, from the AIADMK was the other major demand.\nThe much-anticipated merger of the two warring factions of the AIADMK, however, hit a last-minute roadblock on Friday.\nAccording to reports, EPS and OPS were expected to make a joint appearance at Jayalalithaa\'s memorial in Chennai and announce the merger.\nThe security was also stepped up at the Jayalalithaa mausoleum at Marina Beach late in the evening.\nThe leaders of both the factions, however, started to leave the venue, hinting towards a disruption of the talks again.\nParty sources said there were few issues that were to be addressed by both groups, but didn\'t elaborate further.\nThe political drama in the state unfolded just after the verdict on the disproportionate assets case involving late J. Jayalalithaa and Sasikala was announced and the latter was sentenced to serve the remainder of her jail term.\n'

S"Flood-hit Aurai district of Muzaffarpur on Sunday. (TOI photo)\n PATNA/LUCKNOW: The death toll in Bihar floods has crossed the 300 mark with 51 people losing their lives since Sunday. The figure of flood fatalities stood at 253 till Sunday. 1.38 crore people are battling the deluge in 18 districts of the state. The figure of flood fatalities rose by three each in Assam and Uttar Pradesh. However, life in the deluge-ravaged areas of West Bengal slowly limped back to normalcy, with the water level of rivers receding. \n Around 7.34 lakh people in Bihar have been shifted to safer areas. Close to 3.27 lakh people are putting up in 1,346 relief camps. \n Araria district accounted for 71 deaths alone, Sitamarhi (34), West Champaran (29), Katihar (26), Madhubani (22), East Champaran (19), Darbhanga (19), Madhepura (15), Supual (13), Kisanganj (11), Gopalganj (9), Purnea (9) Muzaffarpur (7), Khagaria (6), Saran (6) and Saharsa (4), Sheohar (4). \n Chief Minister Nitish Kumar held a high-level ministerial meeting to take stock of the flood situation. \n Principal Secretary in the Disaster Management Department Pratyay Amrit said food packets were being airdropped in the inundated areas on war footing. \n The CM ordered that damaged roads be restored at the earliest. \n Meanwhile, train services continued to be affected as floodwaters have overtopped tracks. \n An East Central Railways statement said train services have resumed on some sections under the Samastipur division with speed restriction. \n Chief Public Relations Officer of the ECR Rajesh Kumar said 11 trains have been cancelled for Tuesday. \n These include 15549 Jaynagar-Patna Intercity Express, 25909 Link Express, 15211 Darbhanga-Amritsar Express and 15212 Amritsar-Darbhanga Express, he said. \nUP flood situation grim \n The overall situation in Uttar Pradesh is grim. Three more deaths have pushed the flood toll to 72, the state relief commissioner's office said. \n Over 20 lakh people have been hit by the current spell of floods in 24 districts of the state. 2,688 villages are under water. \n A flood report said 43,602 people have take shelter in relief camps in the affected districts of eastern UP, whipped by the raging waters of the rivers emanating from Nepal. \n Army choppers, NDRF and PAC (flood) jawans continued relief and rescue operations round-the-clock in the severely hit areas of the flood-affected districts of the state. \n The release of water in the rivers emanating from Nepal and incessant rains impeded rescue work and evacuation of people to safer areas. \n Twenty-one companies of the NDRF, 30 of the PAC (flood), two choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and several columns of the Army were working day and night to save lives and properties in the affected areas. \n A Central Water Commission report said the Sharda was flowing above the red mark at Palia Kalan and near the danger mark at Shardanagar while the Ghaghra was flowing above the red mark at Elgin Bridge, Ayodhya and Turtipar (Ballia). \n"

S'The most infamous dish from Gordon Ramsay\'s Hell\'s Kitchen has to be the beef Wellington, a traditional British dish consisting of a seared filet mignon smothered in a whole-grain mustard and wrapped in layers of salty prosciutto, an herbed crepe, duxelles (mushrooms that have been pulverized into a paste), and puff pastry. The whole package is then baked until the crust crisps up and the meat reaches medium-rare perfection. \nSeason after season, it never gets old watching chefs f-up beef Wellingtons and receive a severe verbal spanking from chef Ramsay. Viewers and show contestants alike know the most feared question to come out of Ramsay\'s mouth is, "Who cooked those Wellingtons?" While Gordon plays a tough guy on screen, behind the scenes he\'s every bit the funny jokester. \nI know this because before coming to POPSUGAR, I spent a few years and few seasons working on Ramsay\'s shows Master Chef and Hell\'s Kitchen. Two weeks into the job, I found myself tasked with learning how to make beef Wellington. Thankfully I had a fantastic teacher, one of Gordon\'s behind-the-scenes sous-chefs, who walked me through the process step-by-step and in great detail. Think you\'re up for the challenge? Take a look at the recipe below. \nBeef Wellington\nNotes\nAre you more of a visual person? Watch Gordon Ramsay make a beef Wellington on camera before attempting the recipe to see more visual cues. \nDuxelles is something every good cook should have in their arsenal of tricks. It can be used in place of liver mousse for a vegetarian spread. In addition, try topping it over any rich meat, and you\'ll be surprised by the intense flavor it brings.\nIngredients\n For mushroom duxelles:\n 1 pound cremini mushrooms, coarsely chopped\n 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n 1/2 teaspoon salt\n 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n For herb crepe:\n 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n 2 eggs\n 1 teaspoon sugar\n 1/2 teaspoon salt\n 2 tablespoons chives, minced\n 1/2 cup whole milk\n 1/4 cup water\n 4 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more if needed for pans\n For beef Wellington:\n 2 pounds filet mignon\n Salt and black pepper, to taste\n 2 tablespoons olive oil\n 1/4 cup whole-grain Dijon mustard\n 1/2 pound prosciutto di Parma\n 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed\n 1 egg yolk\n 1 tablespoon whole milk\nDirections\n To make mushroom duxelles: Add mushrooms to a food processor and process until completely smooth. The consistency is similar to wet hummus.\nIn a pan over medium heat, add mushroom paste, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the mixture evenly over the surface and cook on a medium-low heat until the moisture in the paste has reduced and the mixture has the consistency of a spreadable p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9. Remove from heat and let cool.\n To make herb crepes: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and chives. Whisk in milk, water, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter, until smooth and emulsified.\nHeat a crepe pan or large skillet over medium heat. Add remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Add 1/4 cup of the batter. Rotate pan in a circular motion over the heat to completely cover the surface with the batter. The edges of the crepe will begin to curl slightly as the crepe cooks. Cook for approximately 45 to 60 seconds, then flip crepe to cook the other side. Each side should be a pale golden brown. Remove from heat. Add more butter if needed to the pan and repeat process with the remaining batter. Set crepes aside.\nPreheat the oven to 400\xc2\xba F.\n To make steaks: Pat filet mignon dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and black pepper. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke, add the filet mignon and brown from 1 to 2 minutes on all sides. You want to create a nice sear on the outside of the steak but leave the inside raw. Remove from heat and place on a cutting board to cool.\nCover cooled filet with Dijon mustard.\n To roll the beef Wellingtons: On a cutting board, lay out a long piece of plastic wrap. In the middle of the wrap, lay out a crepe. Spread mushroom duxelles over the crepe. Lay out the prosciutto on top of the duxelles. Place filet in the center of the crepe and gently wrap the crepe around the filet. Trim off any excess and use the plastic wrap to tightly wrap the steak.\nLay out a clean, long piece of plastic wrap. Gently roll out puff pastry until it is a 1/4-inch thin. Place the wrapped steak on one end of the puff pastry and wrap. Pinch the ends closed and trim off any excess puff pastry. Use the plastic wrap to tightly seal the puff pastry. Pop it in the fridge for about 5 minutes to let it firm up again.\nIn a bowl, mix together egg yolk and milk.\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper or aluminum foil on a baking sheet. Remove Wellington from fridge, remove the plastic wrap, and lay the Wellington seam-side down on the baking sheet. Baste the top of the puff pastry with the egg wash and bake for approximately 25 to 30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the steak reaches 125\xc2\xba F, or to whatever temperature you prefer your steak.\nRemove from the oven and let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing into medallions. Serve warm.\nInformation\n Category \n Main Dishes, Game \n Yield \n 3 servings \n'

S'Faced with difficult choices, Sri Lanka has to hope China\xe2\x80\x99s Belt and Road can bring prosperity.\nRecently, the Sri Lankan government signed a concessionary agreement for a joint venture between the China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), China\xe2\x80\x99s state-owned port company and the Hambantota port, which is the second largest port in Sri Lanka. According to the agreement, 70 percent of the Hambantota port will be owned by the Chinese company while the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) owns the remaining shares.\nThe port deal, which has led to many controversies, was not the most favorable choice for the government but it was perhaps the only choice.\nBy now, Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s situation in terms of managing the external debt is quite distressing. As Sri Lanka was upgraded to a middle income country, most of its concessionary debt was cut off and this scenario forced the government to obtain commercial debt. In addition to the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank) loans taken at a higher interest, funds were raised through sovereign bonds at commercial interest rates.\nAs a result, over the last decade the composition of the country\xe2\x80\x99s external debt has changed dramatically, with a shift toward costlier, non-concessional debt from previously available concessionary debt. Accordingly, in 2006, only 6 percent of external debt was commercial debt, but by 2012 it exceeded 50 percent of the external debt. This has resulted in a drastic surge in interest paid on external debt, leaving the country rather vulnerable to an economic crisis.\nBack in 2006, Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s external debt stock was only $10.6 billion. Within the last decade, it has increased by nearly 140 percent.\nBy the end of 2016, Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s external debt stock soared to $25.3 billion, which amounts to 34 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product. Out of this massive debt stock, about 13 percent \xe2\x80\x94 which amounts to $3.3 billion \xe2\x80\x94 is owed to China; most of the debt to China was obtained over the last decade.\nThe former Sri Lankan regime led by then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa is in part responsible for China\xe2\x80\x99s growing ownership of Sri Lankan debt. Rajapaksa was not a popular leader amongst Western countries, but was a close ally of China, and was not hesitant to borrow from Beijing and invest in infrastructure projects. As the saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen money comes your way, do not ask questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRajapaksa didn\xe2\x80\x99t; the questions came later.\nThe Hambantota port, a major portion of which was leased to China for 99 years, was one such infrastructure project financed by China and constructed during the Rajapaksa regime. It was not originally meant to be leased to Beijing, although it was constructed using debt obtained from China. However, as time went on, Sri Lanka found it difficult to pay back the loans taken from China\xe2\x80\x99s ExIm Bank at the commercial interest rate for the port\xe2\x80\x99s construction. There was not much return on investment from the port, similar to the fate of the Mattala airport located nearby. The low return on the projects combined with the high interest rate to be paid to the Chinese has ensnared Sri Lanka in a debt trap. The government had no option but to share the asset with the Chinese.\nMost importantly, these Chinese debts were invested in developing strategic locations of the country, giving some control of those areas to China. Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s strategy \xe2\x80\x94 establish power in the South Asian region through economic diplomacy \xe2\x80\x94 was closely observed by India. New Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s strategic concerns had placed the Sri Lankan government between a rock and a hard place.\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s economic dominance in Sri Lanka was not in terms of debt, but also investments. In 2005, the annual foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from China were just under $1 million, but 2014 that figure had soared to over $400 million. These massive FDI inflows went into the controversial Colombo Port City project, later termed as the Colombo International Financial Center. The center raised concerns about Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty since the filled-in land in Colombo would be leased out to the Chinese for 99 years with the expectation of a separate law being applied to the filled-in land. During the last decade, $1.1 billion in FDI was received from China and during the same period only $400 million in FDI was received from the United States.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative and the Way Forward\nGiven the poor performance of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s external sector and slowed growth in the West, Sri Lanka, in fact, had no option but to reach out to China for money. To put it simply, China is where the money is.\nAs Sri Lanka fails to increase its export revenue in light of the soaring external debt servicing payments, the country has to look to other options to raise funds, which seem to come through debt and investments from China. Yet, it remains an open question whether Chinese money has made the situation go from bad to worse due to the high interest on loans and the possible geopolitical consequences of Chinese influence.\nIt is with that backdrop that China\xe2\x80\x99s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) presents offers to the countries across the region. Given the economic crisis that the country has faced, Sri Lanka is not in a position to refuse these offers. Sri Lanka does not have many options left while China has many options to pick from. China has already invested heavily on the Gwadar port in Pakistan and is investing heavily in Bangladesh as well. In this context, Sri Lanka will have to take the Chinese offers to rescue itself from a possible economic downturn. Yet again, the concern is how well these Chinese deals are negotiated and on what conditions Chinese debt is obtained. Given India\xe2\x80\x99s approach of staying away from the BRI, the geopolitical implications that Sri Lanka has to face will be inevitable. Yet, if the Chinese bring good economic prospects through the BRI, adverse geopolitical consequences would not be a bad compromise given that many countries in the region are part of China\xe2\x80\x99s initiative despite India\xe2\x80\x99s objections.\nHowever, diplomacy, like debt, can be flammable if not handled with care. Thus far, debt obtained without farsightedness has put Sri Lanka smack in the middle of the devil and the deep blue sea \xe2\x80\x94 meaning Sri Lanka is faced with difficult choices and has only risky options to chose from. It will be a challenging task for Sri Lanka to balance and battle through, making compromises where needed and striving to ensure the national interest where necessary.\n'

S'Ensuring greater access to the labour market for women remains a challenge, especially when their participation in the workforce is dwindling, Statistics Minister D V Sadananda Gowda said today. \n "A major challenge in India is to promote greater access for women to the labour market," Gowda said addressing the inaugural session of the two-day National Consultation on Data Generation for Gender Indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). \n The minister said, "One of the areas of concern in the employment market is the low level and declining female labour force participation for which strategies need to be evolved to address this issue. During the last decade, the decline in female participation from 29 per cent to 22.5 per cent is a matter of concern." \n The Goal 5 of SDGs aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women in public and private spheres. It also seeks to undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources and access of ownership of property. \n Besides, the SDGs call for ending gender disparity in all sectors, with special emphasis on ending poverty and hunger, ensuring healthy lives, quality education, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth and productive employment and decent work for all. \n The minister said, "The SDG Goal 5 on gender equality and women empowerment along with more than 70 indicators on the 2030 agenda will be monitored at national as well as global levels. This poses a great responsibility on the statistical fraternity to fulfil data requirements under SDGs and help the government in designing targeted interventions to improve these indicators." \n On initiatives taken by his ministry, Gowda said, "There is also focus on identifying new data sources for meeting growing data demand." \n In the works are regular establishment surveys for all sectors, data warehousing initiative and Time Use Surveys. \nThe latter will facilitate generating indicators to measure women\'s contribution at home and in establishments, he added.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'Men, take care of your skin with these tips!\nSkin care regime nowadays is not just a woman\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative.\nNoted beautician Shahnaz Husain has revealed the core differences between the skin of the two sexes and says, \xe2\x80\x9cMen\xe2\x80\x99s skin is little oilier and thicker than women. Difference also lies in texture, hydration and collagen density.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkincare products of men are manufactured differently as compared to any women\xe2\x80\x99s products but the basic element of an effective skin care remains the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she adds.\nHere are some essential skin care tips for men revealed by the beauty expert:\n-To avoid dull, brittle and dry skin, men need to practice regular beauty regime like cleansing, toning and moisturising for maintaining tighter, younger skin and also to protect their skin from atmosphere pollution, vehicle exhausts, sun exposure and other pollutants regularly to avoid puffy eyes and premature wrinkles.\n-Natural, ayurvedic products should be used in the morning and at night which will make you look fresh all the time\n-A light cleansing gel or face wash can be applied on the skin and wiped off with moist cotton wool, or washed off. It will leave the skin cleansed, without causing moisture depletion. Rinse the skin well with plain water and dab on a skin tonic to tone and refresh the skin. Rose water may be used as a toner.\n-For oily skin, mix rose water and astringent lotion in equal quantities. Astringent lotion will be available at a cosmetic store. Rose-based skin tonic is also available. This can be a pre-shave routine.\n-If the skin is oily and prone to blackheads, a facial scrub should be used twice a week, rubbing it gently on the skin, using circular movements and washing off with plain water.\n-For shaving, choose a gentle, creamy, emollient product. This softens the hair, making shaving much easier. It also leaves the skin smooth and supple.\n-Most after-shave lotions are alcohol-based, which can have a drying effect on the skin. A non-greasy after-shave cream which contains powerful antiseptic sandalwood with soothing effect would be ideal. Moreover, a cream helps to keep the skin moisturized, especially in monsoon and winters.\n-Two of the most important aspects of a daily routine for men are cleansing and sun-protection. Cleansing at night is of utmost importance, to remove all the pollutants that have been deposited on the skin during the day. Men spend more time out of doors, in the sun. The application of sunscreens before going out in the sun plays an important role in preventing UV ray damage, sunburn and pre-mature ageing signs.\n-With age, the skin care routine should also include nourishing. This provides the emollients (oils), which helps the skin to hold moisture. The application of night creams, with a light massage, helps to improve skin texture. Nourishing cream containing antioxidants like wheat germ oil, or vitamin-rich ingredients, help to keep the skin look younger and can also have a rejuvenating effect.\n-Using facial scrub once a week helps to remove dead cells and this itself boosts the skin\xe2\x80\x99s cell renewal process. Scrubs should not be applied on pimples, acne or rash.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Weekly salon facials, with professional massage and other techniques, also go a long way towards delaying the ageing signs and rejuvenating the skin. A salon facial can be a real treat and a great way to relax. Apart from maintaining skin-elasticity and resilience, facial massages help to improve the normal functions of the skin, including that of cell-renewal. Face, head and body massages also have great value in terms of inducing relaxation and reducing stress. For oily skin and eruptive conditions, a facial treatment with clean-up should be done, instead of facial massage with cream.\n'

S'On account of Independence Day, Ola is back with their campaign #FarakPadtaHain back. This time, the video highlights that the nation might be free, but the roads aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\nIt takes a dig at those who say that today\xe2\x80\x99s generation is not bothered or affected with anything.\nThe one minute video highlights that, youngsters might not be bothered with small things, like what people wear, what they have and whom they love, but they are surely affected with traffic congestion and pollution caused by so many vehicles on the road. The brand therefore, urges people to take Ola share.\nThe film has clocked around 4.5 million views on Facebook and around 2,420 shares. However, people are mostly talking about their respective experiences with Ola and the brand has received ample of flak on their service.\nWith the help of influencers, Ola is also pushing this video on Twitter\nIn the month of June this year, the brand came up with their #FarakPadtaHain campaign on World Environment Day and asked people to use Share, which can help in reducing congestion on the road.\nWould you like us to review their campaign? Let us know at [email protected] or in the comments below.\n'

S'It\'s hard enough to fit a full workout into your busy schedule, so if you\'re in a hurry, you might forget (or simply skip over) the cooldown after your sweat session is all said and done. After all, you\'re just trying to save yourself some time. But failing to give your body some TLC after a tough workout has some unfortunate consequences, and while you think you\'re being time-efficient, you might just be hurting yourself in the long run.\nYour muscles are pretty tough, but that doesn\'t mean they don\'t need proper care after they\'ve performed at their highest level. Liz Letchford, MS, ATC, a trainer and injury-prevention specialist, told POPSUGAR, "Going straight from exercise to sitting still is hard on the body. The abrupt shift from using muscles to shortening them or sitting on them can cause muscle imbalances and spasms to occur." \nSkip out on that cooldown, and not only will you likely face cramps in the future, but your muscles won\'t repair and grow properly. And that might mean you won\'t even reap the rewards of all your hard work. \nLauren Clare, a personal trainer and certified holistic health coach, confirms this to be true. "When you don\'t properly cool down after an intense workout, your body may stiffen up, which causes your post-workout recovery process to slow down," she told POPSUGAR. "A buildup of lactic acid in the muscles may leave you feeling tight and sore for the next few days." \nAdditionally, you don\'t want to waste the warmth you\'ve generated in your body during a solid workout. This is the perfect time to stretch and gain some mobility. "Tissue length changes are more likely to happen when body temperature is increased," Letchford told POPSUGAR. A cooldown also gives your body the chance to "utilize or \'flush\' any lactate remaining in the blood," Letchford said. \n"We should all cool down for five to 10 minutes after a workout to help improve muscle flexibility and range of motion and to decrease your risk of injury," Clare said in conclusion. Even if it\'s just a few stretches or some moves on the foam roller, you\'ll maximize the benefits of your workout.\n'

S'image via \xe2\x80\x93 rumble.com\nIf you are ever lucky enough to go on a safari, expect the unexpected. That\xe2\x80\x99s because there is no way of truly knowing what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to end up seeing or coming across, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all part of what makes the experience so exciting. When you venture out into the vast open wilderness, where some of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s largest and most fierce animals roam freely, you could run into an endless amount of possibilities. Either which way, an African safari is practically guaranteed to be action packed and filled with thrilling adventures, incredible sights, and awesome memories!\nFor some sightseers, sometimes the most memorable thing they end up witnessing on safari isn\xe2\x80\x99t what they\xe2\x80\x99d expect or assume to see. Not everyone is going to be able to watch a pack of lions take down a Wildebeest or something as dramatic as that. We all know that nature works in mysterious ways and that unpredictability can easily turn out to be adorable instead of violent.\nSuch was the case for the tourists in this video. The group had been traveling down a dusty beaten path when they stopped near a watering hole in order to let a family of elephants pass. At the front leading the way was a larger mother and trailing close behind, right on her heels, were two much smaller elephants. The littlest one of them all was just a baby and his sheer adorableness elicited a reaction from the group of people who began fawning over how cute he was. Their chatter caught the baby elephant\xe2\x80\x99s attention and he turned to look directly at them.\nAll of a sudden a change came across the little elephant\xe2\x80\x99s face and his whole demeanor changed. That\xe2\x80\x99s when he seized up and let out one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most adorable sneezes! The force from it shook his whole body and it even caused him to make a mini trumpeting-type of noise that sounds so stinkin\xe2\x80\x99 cute.\nAs if the baby elephant sneezing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t already sweet enough, his reaction to it was the icing on the cake. Whereas the sound he made had everyone in the group laughing in delight, it instead freaked the poor little baby out. He was super spooked by it and took off running towards his mother. The sight of his little feet moving double time to help him skedaddle on over to mama as fast as he could is nature in its most lovable, adorable, and comical form!\nIn the end, the baby elephant made it to safety behind his mother\xe2\x80\x99s massive frame, where he proceeded to hide out. You just have to see and hear this baby elephant sneeze for yourself, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best!\nPlease SHARE This Video With Family and Friends Who Need a Good Smile Today \n'

S"Hyderabad: Shahid Kapoor is one of the best known actors of Bollywood and is also a very loved one. He married a Delhi based girl Mira Rajput in 2015 and shocked everyone with his inclination towards an ordinary girl who was not even remotely related to Bollywood. Soon after their marriage Mira became a public figure and has a huge fan base. The two are head over heels in love with each other and don't shy away from showing that. But Shahid wasn't Mira's first love, her first boyfriend was one of her college mates.\nPhotos: Official Instagram Accounts, YouTube\n  Left: Mira-Shahid, Right: Mira Aditya\n Aditya Lal and Mira Rajput were school friends and were dating each other for a long time. In fact, Aditya wanted to patch up with Mira right before she got engaged with Shahid, but she denied, obviously! The two were childhood sweethearts and were together till college.\n Later, things went downhill and they parted ways. Aditya went abroad for his higher studies and Mira stayed back pursuing her graduation in Delhi. After Aditya came back he started his career in modelling and also, planned to re-approach Mira but it was too late as she was already promised to Shahid.\n Although Mira's personal life has been under-wraps for a long time, some of her pictures with Aditya from her college days surfaced and went viral on the internet.

S'It is often not realized that among the causes of Kashmir problem \xe2\x80\x93 inclusion of plebiscite in the Instrument of Accession, reference of Kashmir to UN, halting Indian offensive when it was poised to drive out the invaders from Kashmir, Article 370 has played no less a part in preventing J&K from becoming an integral part of the Indian Union. Not many people are aware as how and why this Article was formulated and included in the Indian Constitution despite grave misgivings of Sardar Patel and indeed a large number of the members of Congress Working Committee and Constituent Assembly.\nArticle 370 was worked out in late 1947 between Sheikh Abdullah, who had by then been appointed Prime Minister of J&K by the Maharaja and Nehru, who kept the Kashmir portfolio with himself and kept Sardar Patel, the home minister, away from his legitimate function. Hence Nehru is answerable to all acts of commission and omission, consequences of which we are suffering till date as far as J&K is concerned.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should a state of the Indian Union have a special status? It conveys a wrong signal not only to Kashmiris but also to the separatists, Pakistan and indeed the international community that J&K is still to become integral part of India, the sooner Article 370 is done away is better.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile it was Mountbatten who persuaded Nehru to take the J&K issue to the UN, it was Sheikh Abdullah, who, driven by his ambition to be ruler of an independent Kashmir and his hatred for the Maharaja, persuaded Nehru to give special status to J&K. Among his reasons were \xe2\x80\x93 occupation of one third of J&K by Pakistan, reference to the UN and plebiscite. The most sinister aspect of proposed Article 370 was the provision that any changes could be brought about in it only by the concurrence of J&K assembly. Nehru\xe2\x80\x99s promise that Article 370 was a temporary provision and will get eroded over a period of time has turned out to be a chimera. The first thing that Sheikh Abdullah got done was to abolish hereditary monarchy and redesignate him as Sadar-e-Riyasat who was to be elected by the Assembly. The accession of J&K State into Indian Union was approved by J&K Assembly only in 1956.\nDramatis Personal\nJawahar Lal Nehru The handsome Harrow educated aristocrat who gave up a life of luxury to join the freedom movement. Babu\xe2\x80\x99s choose heir and darling of the masses, he had a fatal flaw. He cared for personalities rather than issues and institutions, be it selection of Lord Mountbatten as the first Governor General of free India, retaining a senior British officer as the Commander-in-Chief of India Army or backing Sheikh Abdullah to the hilt \xe2\x80\x93 his choices were unfortunate. Finally the Chinese aggression of 1962 shattered his image of a world statesman.\nSardar Patel The Iron Man of India \xe2\x80\x94 silent, strong and pragmatic with a complete hold on congress party organization \xe2\x80\x94 rightly credited with creating a unified India by integrating 565 princely states in it \xe2\x80\x94 he would have included Kashmir also in it if allowed to do so by Nehru. The only blot on him was the insinuation that he failed to protect his beloved Bapu. The slur only hastened his end in Dec 1950.\nNehru\xe2\x80\x99s promise that Article 370 was a temporary provision and will get eroded over a period of time has turned out to be a chimera.\nSheikh Mohammed Abdullah Charismatic Kashmiri leader who never let go of his dream of ruling an independent Kashmir even while masquerading as a secularist \xe2\x80\x94 architect of Article 370 along with Nehru. He must share with Nehru the grave consequences. Lion of Kashmir brought Nehru under his spell from 1938 onwards to the extent that in May 1947 when he was arrested by the Maharaja for sedition, Nehru represented Sheikh as his lawyer and was even arrested in Jun 1947 by the Maharaja while trying to enter J&K. Finally Nehru had to eat the humble pie by arresting Sheikh Abdullah for sedition on 9 Aug 1953.\nMaharaja Hari Singh The Maharaja saw an opportunity at the end of British Raj to keep Kashmir as the Switzerland of the East. Trying to repeat history when his ancestors \xe2\x80\x93 Maharaja Gulab Singh and Ranbir Singh gained handsome dividends by keeping aloof during the Sikh War and Great Mutiny, Hari Singh tried to sign a standstill Agreement with India and Pak at the time of independence, Pakistan signed, India declined. Maharaja died a lonely man, forced to abdicate and exiled from his beloved land.\nThe Drama Unfolds\nHaving finalized the text of Article 370 with Sheikh Abdullah, Nehru brought in Gopalaswamy Ayyangar, IAS, as a minister without portfolio to help him deal with Kashmir portfolio and plead the case of Article 370 in the Constituent Assembly. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar had been prime minister of Kashmir for six years with Maharaja Hari Singh. When Sardar Patel expressed his misgivings, this is what Nehru had to say on Dec 27, 1947.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGopalaswamy Ayyangar has been especially asked to help in Kashmir matters. Both for this reason and because of his intimate knowledge and experience of Kashmir, he had to be given full latitude. I really do not know where the States Ministry (Sardar Patel\xe2\x80\x99s ministry) comes into the picture except that it should be kept informed for the steps taken. All this was done at my instance and I do not propose to abdicate my functions in regard to matters for which I consider myself responsible. May I say that the manner of approach to Gopalaswamy was hardly in keeping with the courtesy due to a colleague.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt speaks volumes of Patel\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty to a colleague that despite his own and others misgivings, he managed to convince the members of Constituent Assembly and Congress Party Executive. But to V Shankar he said \xe2\x80\x9cJawaharlal Royega\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe Sardar thereupon resigned and the matter fell in Gandhiji\xe2\x80\x99s lap to bring the two colleagues together. During this period, V Shankar, IAS was the personal secretary to Patel and had maintained a record of all events. It is clear from these records that Nehru finalized the draft of Article 370 alongwith Sheikh Abdullah without even informing Patel. Thereafter it fell to Gopalaswamy Ayyangar to get the draft passed in the Constituent Assembly discussions. The proposal was torn to pieces by the Constituent Assembly and also Congress Party Executive.\nNehru, who was abroad at the time, swallowed his pride and rang up Patel and requested him to get the Article 370 approved It speaks volumes of Patel\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty to a colleague that despite his own and others misgivings, he managed to convince the members of Constituent Assembly and Congress Party Executive. But to V Shankar he said \xe2\x80\x9cJawaharlal Royega\xe2\x80\x9d. V Shankar, in his record has described the meeting of the Congress Executive Committee \xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting was one of the stormiest I have ever witnessed barring the party meeting which discussed the proposition relating to Rajaji becoming the first President of Indian Republic. The opinion in opposition to Gopalaswamy\xe2\x80\x99s formula was forcefully and even militantly expressed and the issue even brought in the sovereignty of the Constituent Assembly to draw up the Constitution without being tied down to the apron-strings of the Kashmir State Constituent Assembly. In such a situation even Maulana Azad was shouted down.\nThe Party was in uproar. The Sardar had to plead that because of the international complications, a provisional approach alone could be made leaving the question of final relationship to be worked out according to the exigencies of the situation and mutual feelings and confidence that would have been by then created. Once the Sardar had taken charge, all opposition to the draft was silenced\xe2\x80\x9d And how Nehru responded to this great act of loyalty on part of Sardar? On 24 July 1952, after Sardar was no more, Nehru made a detailed statement on Kashmir in the Parliament on slow integration of Kashmir into India Union and mentioned that \xe2\x80\x9cSardar Patel was all the time dealing with these matters.\xe2\x80\x9d Even Gopalaswami Ayyangar was dismayed at this blatant lie and mentioned to V Shankar \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an ill return to the Sardar for the magnanimity he had shown in accepting Panditji\xe2\x80\x99s point of view against his better judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nConsequences of Article 370\nArticle 370 has been the biggest impediment to integration of J&K State into Indian Union. That it was incorporated in the Indian Constitution by the machination of two individuals \xe2\x80\x93 Shiekh Abdullah and Nehru is all the more regrettable. Nehru had to eat the humble pie when he had to arrest the Sheikh for his divisive and anti national stance on 8 Aug 1953 but he did not let go of his concept of keeping J&K a separate entity. In 1957, some top leaders of National Conference led by Mr Qasim split the party and formed a group called Democratic National Conference (DNC).\nArticle 370, included in the Constitution on a temporary provision should have been gradually abrogated. This has not happened in sixty years.\nIt had abrogation of Article 370 on its agenda. Nehru would not brook any opposition to his policy of keeping J&K a separate entity. He told the leaders that a new threat (China) is emerging and it is an inopportune time to raise this issue and forced them to drop their demand. Nehru thereafter decided to withdraw the Kashmir conspiracy case against Sheikh Abdullah. This case had been going on since May 21, 1958. The formal orders however were issued by Govt of India on 8 April 1964.\nIt is often forgotten that J&K state is not a homogeneous entity. Apart from Valley Muslims, Jammu has a predominantly Hindu population while Ladakh has a mix of Buddhist and Muslims. Then you have the Gujjars & Bakarwals. Why is Article 370 detrimental to the full integration of J&K state into Indian Union. Firstly the Central Govt can make laws only with concurrence of the State govt, practically giving it the Veto power. Article 352 and 360 for declaration of national and financial emergency respectively cannot be applied in Kashmir. While a citizen of India has only Indian citizenship, J&K citizens have two citizenships. Anti Defection Law is not applicable to J&K. No outsider can buy property in J&K state.\nThe beneficial laws such as Wealth Tax, Gift Tax & Urban Land Ceiling Act and intermarriage with other Indian nationals do not operate in J&K State. Even Article 356 under which President of India can impose his rule in any state cannot be enforced in J&K without consent of the Governor who himself is an appointee of the President. State of J&K can refuse building of any cantonment on any site or refuse to allot land for defence purposes.\nArticle 370, included in the Constitution on a temporary provision should have been gradually abrogated. This has not happened in sixty years. In fact whenever someone mentions this, vested interests raise an outcry that legitimate rights of Kashmiris are being trampled upon. Stated agenda of National Conference is return to pre 1953 status. Why should a state of Indian Union have a special status? It conveys a wrong signal not only to Kashmiris but also to the separatists, Pakistan and indeed the international community that J&K is still to become integral part of India, the sooner Article 370 is done away is better.\n=======================================================================\nArticle 370 of the Constitution of India\nTemporary Provisions with respect to the State of Jammu & Kashmir\n1. Notwithstanding anything in this constitution:\n(a) The provisions of Article 238 shall not apply in relation to the State of Jammu & Kashmir.\n(b) The power of Parliament to make laws for the said state shall be limited to\n(i) those matters in the Union List and the Concurrent List which in consultation with the Government of the State, are declared by the President to correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the accession of State to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for that State and\n(ii) Such other matters in the Said Lists as, with the concurrence of the Govt of the State, the President may, by order specify.\n1.

S'Photo: Jovana Rikalo\nGut health plays such a central role in our wellness, affecting the status of our immune system, skin, nervous system, brain, and pretty much every other bodily system. The more we learn about the microbiome\xe2\x80\x94and the ways in which our modern lifestyles disrupt the delicate balance of good and bad bacteria in the digestive tract\xe2\x80\x94the easier it is to convince ourselves that our guts must be in utter disarray.\nIf you can relate to this paranoia\xe2\x80\x94you\'re not alone. And your concerns may be valid, seeing as the standard American diet, chronic stress, lack of sleep, travel, and exposure to chemicals can all have pretty devastating effects on our gut health. But in reality, the only way to know for sure is to test. So I got my microbiome sequenced through a BIOHM gut report and then had a chat with Mahmoud Ghannoumm\xe2\x80\x94a doctor of microbiology who led digestive health research at the National Institutes of Health\xe2\x80\x94to finally face the truth (good or bad) about my gut health status. Here\'s what I learned:\n1. Your microbiome is a moving target. \nAs much as I wanted this test to be pass or fail, that just wasn\'t the case. Instead, my results showed a snapshot of what my gut health looked like in that moment, and learning this made me feel both a little disappointed and somewhat relieved. Your microbiome is changing every day based on what you eat, drink, and do, so getting it tested is less definitive than you might like. But this ever-changing nature also means that each time you choose an apple over a Snickers bar your gut bacteria are thanking you\xe2\x80\x94almost immediately. \n2. Gut health isn\'t just about bacteria. \nYes, the BIOHM gut report included information about the of bacteria residing in my gut, but it also provided info on the fungal species that are inhabiting my digestive tract. Luckily, the most famous fungus, Candida, came back within normal levels (phew). But I did have elevated levels of one yeast that likes to feed off simple carbohydrates. This worried me, but Dr. Ghannoumm assured me that it could have simply been that I had eaten some fruit on the day before my test. \n3. Diversity is just as important as quantity. \nI like to think that I am pretty gut-health literate, so I was surprised by all of the names of bacteria and fungi in my results that I didn\'t recognize. Apparently, each one has an identified positive or negative role in a healthy microbiome. It made me think about how we get so overwhelmed with the number of probiotics in our guts that we might want to pay a little more attention to the diversity of bacteria and what their known roles are. \n4. A healthy gut means something different for everyone. \nIn the BIOHM test, your gut microbiomes are compared to someone with a "well-balanced digestive system." But I was surprised when Dr. Ghannoumm didn\'t look worried when my results differed from the ideal sample. The healthy model was really just a reference point, and each person will have a different unique makeup. \n5. Probiotics are not magic. \nProbiotics are an awesome part of any wellness regime, but they aren\'t the holy grail. This is because healthy bacteria also rely on a healthy diet\xe2\x80\x94full of fiber and nutrients\xe2\x80\x94to really grow, flourish, and do their jobs. For example, a certain gut bacteria protects us against the flu, but it needs flavonoids (phytochemicals found in foods like blueberries) to actually activate this feature. \n6. There\'s a LOT more to learn about the microbiome. \nThe fact that I just got my microbiome profiled using DNA-sequencing technology is proof that we\'ve made a lot of progress in this area of science, but there is still SO much more to learn. We want to know more about the roles of specific bacteria and how they fit into the overall picture of gut health. \nOverall, I learned a lot. But not as much as I would have liked. Luckily, scientists and researchers are working every single day to advance our knowledge of the microbiome. Here\'s to hoping we\'ll be able to take that knowledge practically, to improve our overall health and well-being. \n'

S'E-commerce businesses are becoming a reliable way to buy products online. Branding plays a direct role in improving chances of e-commerce business success. An increasing number of global customers are switching to e-commerce sites to purchase everything from groceries to apparel, and electronics to lifestyle products. The e-commerce industry has completely transformed the way in which consumers around the world access products and services. It has suddenly brought a world of options to the fingertips of end users. The future seems bright for the e-commerce industry, with major players branching out into newer product categories frequently (thus setting the standards for smaller brands).\nFor e-commerce businesses, things are going well enough, but the competition is also fierce. New e-commerce brands are launching every day and persistently trying to get a foothold online. When it comes to branding, e-commerce companies are leaving no stone unturned. In this scenario, it is vital that you build and implement a high quality branding strategy for your e-commerce business.\nBranding Strategies For E-Commerce Businesses\nBy having a result-oriented, effective branding plan for your e-commerce business, you can stand out amongst your competitors. To achieve that, you must determine what makes your e-commerce business a unique player in the industry. Are you offering high quality products at the best available rates? Do you organize regular discounts and offers for your customers? Are you adding new product categories to meet more customer demands? What are the factors that would convince customers to choose your brand against others? E-commerce business owners must strive to highlight the unique selling points of their brand. Only then can an e-commerce brand be boldly promoted to larger audiences.\nAs an e-commerce brand, you have to be at the forefront when it comes to attracting product vendors as well as consumers to your e-store. Vendors would be interested in using your marketplace, if it has a strong brand that keeps providing value to customers. The number of sellers and customers you bring in to your network depends on the strength of your e-commerce brand, and how well it delivers on its promises. If you are intelligent in your branding, and consistent in your service quality, your e-commerce brand can achieve considerable success.\nE-commerce branding, like all branding, is influencing the perception of your brand and its services, in the eyes of the customer. Effective e-commerce branding will make marketing easier, retain more customers, drive up loyalty, and create better potential value for steady, long-term success.\nThe way you must approach an e-commerce branding strategy is by highlighting some key points. With branding, you must uphold your business\xe2\x80\x99s core mission, the problems you aim to solve for your customers, standards that it adheres to, and proof of the quality of services you provide. What are the factors involved in business branding and their importance?\nE-Commerce Branding \xe2\x80\x93 Methods and Importance\n1. Your Brand Image \xe2\x80\x93 A stellar, uniquely identifiable brand image helps customers attach value to your e-commerce brand\xe2\x80\x99s personality. This includes various things such as logos, banners, taglines, marketing captions, social content etc., which should always represent your brand the best. This is quite important if you want to create value for potential customers and convert them into loyal customers. A good brand image goes a long way in retaining customers, by continually generating interest for your e-commerce brand\xe2\x80\x99s offerings.\n2. Customer Satisfaction \xe2\x80\x93 Customers are everything, when it comes to e-commerce or any other type of business.

Put your best foot forward while marketing, deliver on your promises you make, and provide unmatched service and support to enhance your brand\xe2\x80\x99s potential value. Remember that satisfied existing customers can and will bring in newer customers to your e-commerce business. Maintain your integrity and keep reinventing to bolster your brand\xe2\x80\x99s chances of business success.\n3. Find Your Unique Selling Proposition \xe2\x80\x93 As an e-commerce business owner you must determine the USP of your brand. This will help you brand and promote it better to larger groups of potential customers. Think about what sets you apart from dozens of competitors vying for true e-commerce glory. Is it your service quality or support? Is it the trust of your customers and your track record? Do you provide innovative offers, discounts and promotions on special occasions? Do you house the widest variety of rare products? You must determine why customers would choose your e-commerce site. What extra value can you offer to your potential customers that convince them to use your platform again and again? Find your USP and use it to strengthen your brand.\n4. Utilize All Channels \xe2\x80\x93 Technological advances in the past decade demand that your e-commerce business maximizes its presence on all social, web-based and mobile platforms. More and more potential customers buy and sell through handheld devices, and almost all of them are on social websites. All your competitors are doing it, and so should you. It will help you make your brand easily accessible to larger audiences, which in turn will bring more conversions and significantly better revenues.

S'Gabba curator Kevin Mitchell Jr and Darren Lehmann, coach of Australia. (Getty Images)\n MELBOURNE: Long-serving Gabba curator Kevin Mitchell, who has prepared pitches at the Australian cricket fortress for over 30 years, has said he will step down after the series-opening Ashes Test. \n The Brisbane venue has long been acclaimed for the quality of its pitches, which invariably offer pace and bounce for fast bowlers, turn for spinners and the possibility of big totals for batting sides. \n "I\'d taken a step back from the physical side of work and engaged in more of a guidance role with the team to see out my contract while helping to recruit my successor," Mitchell told Brisbane\'s Courier Mail . \n "I want to thank the grounds team for their continual efforts to meet the high standards required and maintaining the culture of having great pride in producing quality playing surfaces." \n  Queensland sports minister Mick de Brenni paid tribute to Mitchell for laying the foundation for some of Australia\'s most dominant performances. \n "Kevin truly is an icon, and to have kept producing an absolute world-class deck on a ground that\'s used all year round has taken a particular talent. So, absolutely, very, very big shoes to fill," he said. \n Mitchell learned under the wing of his father and former head groundsman Kevin Mitchell Snr, who tended the grounds from 1975-89 before being succeeded by his son. \n "The great West Indies side were out in those days with the four big quicks and Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and the like... and I just thought, \'what a great place to work,\'" Mitchell said in comments published by state broadcaster ABC. \n "The Gabba is a famous, iconic, historic stadium, and you feel that responsibility to create something that Queenslanders are proud of. You have to love the job -- it\'s a big part of your life." \n Australia have not lost a test at the Gabba since 1988, when they were beaten by West Indies, and only two of the last 13 matches have been draws. \n Australia play the Ashes series opener on Nov. 23, four years after thrashing England at the same venue by 381 runs when left-arm seamer Mitchell Johnson took nine wickets. \n England opening batsman Jonathan Trott\'s struggles against the short ball at the Gabba saw him promptly exit the tour with a stress-related illness and Australia went on to whitewash England 5-0. \n'

S"Washington, Aug 21: USS Indianapolis, a World War II American Warship, which was torpedoed by the Japanese navy in 1945, was located by the researchers in the Pacific Ocean.\nThe ship was sunk 18000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean when it was hit by a Japanese Submarine during the Second World War. Its remains were discovered by the US Navy researchers.\nAccording to the Reuter report, the warship was returning after delivering components for the atom bomb that the Axis forces dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima when it was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945. \nThe Indianapolis sunk in just 12 minutes, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. There was no distress signal from the ship. It had 800 out of 1196 crew members aboard and 316 could be rescued and saved five days later. The remaining crew members were dead due to exposure, dehydration, drowning. Some others were devoured by the sharks.\nHowever, the efforts to discover the remains of the lost warship were renewed after a Navy historian hit upon new information in 2016 about the last movements of the warship. They pointed to new search area and a team of civilian researchers was deployed on the mission to discover the remains of the warship. Paul Allen, Microsoft Corp co-founder led the team and spent months searching in a 1500 sq km patch of the Pacific Ocean.\nSearching with a vessel fitted with equipment that could reach the deepest ocean floor, Allen\xe2\x80\x99s team members succeeding in locating the wreckage of the ship somewhere in the Phillippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in statement on his website. \nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and this could play an important role in honouring the sailors and underlining their role in ending the World War II. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Allen said in his statement.\nThe identification of the warship was easier as some of the wreckage was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the US Navy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s not Indianapolis then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship's crew.

S'Letter adds that, even when you\xe2\x80\x99re targeted via stingray, you can still call 911.\nThe acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency charged with deportations, has confirmed in a new letter that it does not use cell-site simulators, also known as stingrays, to locate undocumented immigrants.\nIn the August 16 letter, which was sent to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), acting Director Thomas Homan wrote that, since October 2015, ICE has followed similar guidelines put in place by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security a month earlier, which require a warrant before deploying a stingray.\nHoman was responding to an earlier letter than Senator Wyden sent to him. The Oregon Democrat has also recently sent a similar letter to the Department of Justice, which has not yet responded. That August 1 letter states: "We are concerned that the Department may not be adequately disclosing to courts important details about how stingrays work and their impact on innocent Americans."\nAs Ars has reported for years, stingrays determine a phone\xe2\x80\x99s location by spoofing a cell tower. In some cases, they can also intercept calls and text messages. Once deployed, the devices intercept data from a target phone along with information from other phones within the vicinity.\nHistorically, government agencies and the companies that make the devices have been extremely reticent about providing precise details about how the devices work. The Harris Corporation, which makes the trademarked device known as the StingRay, among other related surveillance devices, has previously refused to provide additional details to Ars.\nThe Homan letter makes a point though to say that \xe2\x80\x9cinterference with non-targeted mobile devices is virtually nonexistent.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe mobile identifier of non-targeted mobile handsets is verified by the cell-site simulators automatically as a non-target and sent back to the best mobile network. This process is conducted in an amount of time that is not noticeable to the user. If a call is placed or received during the exact instant the verification is taking place, interference may result. The equipment software has provisions to allow a captured device one currently engaged by the cell-site simulator to return to the host network if the captured device initiates a call. In all circumstances, devices are always able to dial 911 without any disruption of service.\nThis description is curious given that a Friday warrant application, filed by an FBI agent in a drug case in Wisconsin, describes \xe2\x80\x9cservice disruption\xe2\x80\x9d to phones that aren\xe2\x80\x99t targeted by the stingray as being \xe2\x80\x9cbrief and temporary.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoman\xe2\x80\x99s assertion about \xe2\x80\x9calways\xe2\x80\x9d being able to call 911 regardless of whether a stingray is in use also appears not to be consistent with an episode in Canada from May 2016. At that time, Canadian media reported on the Asian Assassinz trial in Toronto. In that case, Detective Shingo Tanabe swore in an affidavit that the Toronto Police would not keep its stingray on for more than three minutes at a time for fear of running afoul of Canadian telecom law and blocking possible 911 traffic.\nIn August 2016, a Georgetown law professor filed a formal complaint to the Federal Communications Commission over the alleged disruption to the 911 system.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate this substantive response from ICE, confirming the agency\xe2\x80\x99s policy is to obtain a warrant to use stingrays and other cell-site simulators,\xe2\x80\x9d Sen. Wyden, who has been pushing since 2011 for a law to require warrants when stingrays are used, wrote to Ars in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cBut department policies aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same as lasting protections for our liberties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S" When two films make good collections at the box office or if they get good talk, then a director's career is more or less made. They are immediately picked up by producers looking for bankable directors. But Kalyan Krishna has totally gone off the radar.\nHe had made two films for Annapurna Banner. Soggade Chinni Nayana and Rarandoi Veduka Chuddam did well at the box-office.\nHowever, despite this, Kalyan Krishna is no where in action. He has no films on hand and neither is he visible in media.\nSome have been wondering if he is busy with pre-production work of his next film. But that does not seem to be the case. Though many producers are looking for a good project with a hit director, there seem to be no takers for Kalyan Krishna.\nOne reason could be the mess up during the making of Rarandoi Veduka Chuddam. At the time, there were rumours that Nagarjuna was unhappy with the final product and even took to editing the film to save it from being a disaster.\nWhile there was talk that he might direct Akhil, the younger Akkineni took to another project.\nSo did the rumours affect the career of Kalyan Krishna? After Khaidi No 150, Vinayak too is in a similar situation.\nAlready there are directors like Veerabhadram Choudhary, Chandra Mohan, Sampath Nandi who are finding it hard to find projects. Now, Harish Shanker is the latest one to join this list.\nSeniors like Yeleti and Neelakanta have been in waiting for long too. It remains to be seen if Kalyan Krishna will come out of this hibernation and announce a project.\n"

S'The confiscation of the Chinese ship and arrest of its 20 crew in the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos show just how hard it is to protect marine sanctuaries.\nOn Sunday marine ecologist Pelayo Salinas was on his way back from a 12-day research mission on a Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park patrol ship when at 6 a.m. the captain spotted a vessel on the radar. Access to these waters is restricted, so they radioed the vessel to find out what it was up to.\nNo response. Salinas, who works with the Charles Darwin Foundation, and a Ecuadorian Navy officer who was also on board tried again. Still no response. They warned the vessel that the law requires them to respond. Silence.\nThen Salinas and three others jumped in a 13-foot inflatable boat that had been donated to the park and took chase. They\xe2\x80\x99d identified the vessel as Chinese and strongly suspected it was involved in illegal fishing.\nThe vessel was intercepted about 40 miles northeast of the island of San Crist\xc3\xb3bal.\nNew protections\nAccessible for scientific use and tourism only; no extraction of natural resources (including fishing) allowed\nGal\xc3\xa1pagos Marine Reserve\nArtisanal fishing permitted, along with tourism and science\nIsla Darwin\nIsla Wolf\nDarwin and Wolf\nMarine Sanctuary\nECUADOR\nIsla San Salvador\nIsla Fernandina\nIsla Santa Cruz\nIsla San Crist\xc3\xb3bal\nIsla Santa Mar\xc3\xada\nIsla Espa\xc3\xb1ola\n40 mi\n40 km\nLAUREN C.

TIERNEY, NG STAFF\nSOURCE: MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, ECUADOR\nThis part of Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park\xe2\x80\x94a marine sanctuary where absolutely no fishing is allowed\xe2\x80\x94has the greatest abundance of sharks known in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s this that has made these waters a target of fishermen looking to supply Asian markets with shark fin and shark meat. Worldwide, shark populations are declining, with more than a quarter of sharks and related species considered to be threatened with extinction.\nTheir little boat, a Zodiac, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t designed for hot pursuit, however, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to catch up. They abandoned the chase and reported the Chinese boat to park headquarters. At the park\'s control center, park authorities and the Ecuadorian navy identified the vessel in their electronic surveillance system and sprung into action, says Walter Bustos, the director of Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park.\nSoon a navy helicopter and coast guard boat were dispatched, along with Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park rangers. They caught up with the ship, a China-flagged vessel called Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999. What they found stunned them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were thousands, if not tens of thousands, of sharks,\xe2\x80\x9d Salinas says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be historic. The biggest seizure of sharks in the history of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe crew of 20 have been arrested, and the Ecuadorian authorities are planning a full accounting of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s inventory. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal to cross the marine sanctuary\xe2\x80\x99s waters without a permit, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also illegal to catch, trade, or transport sharks there. Authorities do not yet know where the fish were caught, according to a statement from Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Environment.\nThe vessel is a \xe2\x80\x9cmothership,\xe2\x80\x9d or reefer, which collects fish from smaller fishing boats, allowing them to stay out at sea longer. It\xe2\x80\x99s more than 300 feet long with six cargo bays, several of which were completely full, he says. The ship\xe2\x80\x99s log says there are about 300 tons of fish on board, according to the statement. Salinas himself hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been on board yet, but in photos of the holds he identified endangered scalloped hammerheads and silky sharks, as well as tuna.\nIn a call with National Geographic, Bustos praised those who helped bring the vessel in. \xe2\x80\x9cThe special effort of the army of Ecuador and the park rangers\xe2\x80\x94they are the real heroes of this story.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCAUGHT BY PURE CHANCE\n\xe2\x80\x9cSadly, this is day-to-day business on the ocean,\xe2\x80\x9d Salinas says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are thousands of these ships roaming the waters.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe incident highlights the ongoing problem of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing that occurs even in the world\xe2\x80\x99s most protected waters.\nArmada del Ecuador captura buque pesquero Chino en reserva marina de #Galapagos \xf0\x9f\x91\xae\xf0\x9f\x91\x89https://t.co/MOZPe2PPxK #FFAAContigo \xe2\x9a\x93\xef\xb8\x8f pic.twitter.com/oZdAzxKWTz\n\xe2\x80\x94 Armada del Ecuador (@armada_ecuador) August 14, 2017 \nThe Ecuadorian Navy tweeted aerial photos of the ship just before capture.\nIt was pure chance that the vessel was caught, Salinas says. For some reason (likely by accident, he suspects), it had its AIS\xe2\x80\x94an automatic tracking system used by all ships\xe2\x80\x94turned on. Ships engaging in illegal activity, for obvious reasons, turn them off. That likely lapse helped law enforcement track the vessel down.\nDespite its high-profile status in the tourism and scientific worlds, Galapagos National Park doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have all the resources it needs to protect the ecosystem.\n\xe2\x80\x9cResources are limited,\xe2\x80\x9d Salinas says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bad guys are every day making more money. Patrolling is expensive, especially for a county that is in economic crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d He points to the Zodiac as an example. If they\xe2\x80\x99d had a proper boat intended for law enforcement, they could have caught up with the vessel when they first spotted it. (Salinas has started a crowdfunding page to raise money for two speed boats for the park.)\nThe arrested crew could face up to three years in prison, and conservationists are hoping this case will be aggressively pursued. China is Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s largest creditor, providing some 60 percent of the government\xe2\x80\x99s funding, and critics have accused Ecuador of being lenient with China when it comes to protection of timber and other natural resources in the Amazon rain forest.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcuador showed leadership in its vision\xe2\x80\x9d by establishing the marine protected area, says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas expedition to the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it needs to show its commitment by enforcing the law."\nAt a press conference today, Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s Minister of the Environment, Tarsicio Granizo, said the government is committed to doing so. \xe2\x80\x9cOur policy is zero tolerance for the transport and trafficking of protected wildlife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n This story was updated on August 17, 2017, with comment from the director of Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park. \n Read more stories about wildlife crime and exploitation on National Geographic\xe2\x80\x99s Wildlife Watch.

S'Xbox One X release date, specs, price, games and everything we know\nXbox One X, previously known as Project Scorpio, is Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s 4K UHD console coming later this year. We\xe2\x80\x99ve compiled everything you need to know about the new system including its specs, release date, price, games and more.\nMicrosoft has fully spilled the beans on the Xbox One X, and it looks like it has been worth the wait.\nFor starters, the Xbox One X will be fully backwards-compatible with Xbox One games \xe2\x80\x93 and offer improved performance on these titles to boot.\nOn the technical side, there was some new information about the specs. The processor is cooled using a liquid vapour chamber, a technique that\xe2\x80\x99s becoming more common on more compact devices. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a brand-new power-management system for the most efficient delivery of electricity seen on an Xbox console.\nAnd finally, Microsoft revealed the Xbox One X\xe2\x80\x99s price and release date. Read on for full details of everything we now know about the Xbox One X.\nXbox One X pre-orders: when can I buy one?\nYou can now pre-order the Xbox One X ahead of its November release. Microsoft confirmed specific details during its recent Gamescom presentation, which is also saw the reveal of the Xbox One X: Project Scorpio Edition.\nThis hugely limited hardware is now available to pre-order, although many retailers have already ran out of stock. At the time of writing, it can still be pre-ordered directly from the Microsoft Store and GAME. It maintains the \xc2\xa3449.99 price of the standard console, meaning this is something hardcore Xbox fans will want to have in their collection.\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Amazon UK \nPre-order: Xbox One X from Amazon US\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Very\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Argos\nXbox One X Specs: How powerful is the Xbox One X?\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a quick breakdown of all the key Xbox One X specs:\n CPU: Eight-core 2.3GHz processor\n GPU: 40 compute units at 1172MHz\n RAM: 12GB GDDR5 (shared between system and GPU)\n Bandwidth: 326GB/s\n Storage: 1TB hard disk\n Disc: UHD Blu-ray player\n Video: 4K output, HDR 10 support\n Audio: DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and Atmos, PCM 2.0, 5.1, 7.1\n Wireless: Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, IR blaster\n Connectors: 2x HDMI (2.0b out, 1.4b in), 3x USB 3.0 ports, IR out, S/PDIF, Ethernet\nFirst, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the headline Xbox One X specs before moving onto how this will affect gaming resolution and performance.\nThe One X uses an eight-core processor, likely from AMD although not officially stated, running at 2.3GHz. Seasoned PC gamers might not think this sounds like a lot and, indeed, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But keep in mind console processors are packed into an incredibly tight space, and more GHz means more heat. This is still a substantial boost over the Xbox One, whose eight cores ran at 1.75GHz.\nIn the graphics department, the One X will get a GPU with 40 compute units running at a seriously impressive 1172MHz. Even more startling is the massive 12GB of GDDR5 memory, which is a handy combination of more and faster memory. This 12GB will be shared by the whole system, so some will be reserved for the CPU with the rest going to the GPU.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get a 1TB hard disk inside your Xbox One X, along with a UHD Blu-ray player. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all we know.\nScroll down to bite your teeth in the Xbox One X\xe2\x80\x99s performance, but first, let\xe2\x80\x99s quickly address the all-important matter of its price and release date.\nXbox One X Price and Release Date: Where can I pre-order the console?\nAt E3, Microsoft revealed that the Xbox One X will be released on November 7 2017 \xe2\x80\x93 just in time to make it this year\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas must-buy.\nThe company also divulged that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be relatively affordable for such a powerful new-gen console, costing \xc2\xa3449 in the UK and $499 in the States.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s huge news for those who bought an Xbox or PS4 back in 2013 and have been waiting to upgrade to the next \xe2\x80\x98major leap\xe2\x80\x99 system. That starting price also puts it close enough to the PS4 Pro, which will give potential buyers of Sony\xe2\x80\x99s latest console some serious pause for thought.\nXbox One X Performance: How does it stack up against its rivals?\nThe biggest way performance has been boosted over the current-gen Xbox One S is the GPU (graphics processing unit). Up from 12 compute units at 914MHz, we now have 40 cores running at 1172MHz. Cores and clock speeds don\xe2\x80\x99t mean everything, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting ten times the performance here.\nBut what you are getting is impressive 4.6x performance multiplier. This opens up a huge number of possibilities for developers, with ultra-high-resolution textures and 4K resolutions now a core part of the game development process.\nFor PC gamers who want a rough comparison to a GPU currently in the wild, the 6TFLOPs (trillion floating point operations per second) figure bandied around when the Scorpio was announced is roughly akin to Nvidia\xe2\x80\x99s GTX 1070, a card that can handle 1440p and UHD gaming at a push. But there\xe2\x80\x99s much more to graphics power than TFLOPs, and consoles are always much more efficient at making use of hardware than PCs.\nDigital Foundry was shown a single stress test running on One X hardware, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on how real games will actually run, but Microsoft has revealed a lot of details on how it will support different resolutions and graphics settings.\nStill, the stress test, which is based on Forza Motorsport, ran at Ultra HD resolution at 60fps, which is an enticing prospect when you consider the One X, apparently, was only using 70% of its graphical might to do this. Microsoft then turned up the heat to higher graphics settings, and DF says the console \xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t break a sweat\xe2\x80\x99. What this means in reality we don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know, but it all sounds very promising.\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a console for 4K TV owners, though. Games developed for Xbox One X will have customisable graphics settings for all types of displays, so even if you only have a 1080p TV you\xe2\x80\x99ll still be able to ask your One X to render everything in UHD and then downscale it to 1080p for the sharpest gaming experience you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Or, for better performance, you could just amp up the graphics settings but keep the resolution at 1080p.\nIn other words, this is a PC in console\xe2\x80\x99s clothing.\nThe One X will run all current Xbox One games and should improve performance, whether or not they have been updated for the new console. It runs on the same software as Xbox One, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to buy all your games again.\nXbox One X is VR-capable, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nThe Xbox One X is capable of running games in virtual reality, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet sold on the technology.\nSpeaking to Stevivor, Spencer says that while he\xe2\x80\x99s a fan, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the tech or games are quite there yet, and that will affect its availability on One X.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love the technology behind VR. I have an HTC Vive; I have an Oculus Rift. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the PlayStation [VR] device a lot in demos and stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think VR will find its spot in gaming; I would make that bet,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe designed Scorpio as a VR-capable console. Whether that happens this year, next year or the year after\xe2\x80\xa6 like I said, I still think the creative community has to get its arms around what are these new tools, and this new feeling \xe2\x80\x93 this new immersion.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat experiences do you put in people\xe2\x80\x99s hands to have a long-term engagement? Most of these things I\xe2\x80\x99m playing now feel like demos and experiments, which I actually think it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the right thing to have happened. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a criticism at all. But I think it will take time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSpencer believes that in order for VR to become a mainstream success, it needs to be wireless.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the long run, we need untethered solutions. You need to have the compute capability to not be wired to the display that\xe2\x80\x99s on my head. That means I either have some kind of high-bandwidth wireless HDMI or I have compute here.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the HoloLens we\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to put compute in the HMD itself, so it\xe2\x80\x99s right there. The other thing I think most people who look along in this technology is a mixed reality world, where I have a head-mounted display that can go from a fully enclosed, opaque world that is VR to a fully transparent one where I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing augmentation in my world. I should have one device that spans both.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Amazon UK \nPre-order: Xbox One X from Amazon US\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Very\nPre-order: Xbox One X from Argos\nOne major VR title we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to see on Project One X is Fallout 4, which is currently in development at Bethesda. Due to launch in 2017 for HTC Vive. Pete Hines recently gave Hip Hop Gamer an update on the project, and it sounds pretty damn exciting.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFallout 4 VR is the most incredible thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in your life. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine what it\xe2\x80\x99s like, playing in VR and how realistic it looks and everywhere you turn your head. It is going to blow your mind. It is the craziest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen,\xe2\x80\x9d game director Todd Howard told Hines.\nNo mention of this game was made during Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s 2017 E3 event though, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\n'

S'Image used for representational purpose only\nKOLLAM: Call it a major bid to provide a new dimension to the tourism sector. Carrying the broad message of \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s Own Country, People\xe2\x80\x99s Own Tourism\xe2\x80\x99, the Department of Tourism is gearing up to introduce a Responsible Tourism Mission (RTM) across the state. While the idea was pitched in July, officers say the government gave administrative sanction for the same the other day. It\xe2\x80\x99s said the introduction of novel initiatives like Responsible Tourism (RT) ethnic food fest, RT art and cultural forum, tourism resource mapping among others will become a part of the programme.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key point of RTM will be the enhancement of community-level tourism activities and tourism-trade-community level linkages,\xe2\x80\x9d an officer with the Tourism Directorate told Express. \xe2\x80\x9cAs part of its introduction, we are now planning to conduct workshops for LSGs and other stakeholders along with capacity building and training programmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdequate training to various stakeholders like community members, local bodies, government agencies, non-governmental organisations and others is needed for making RT initiatives more effective and result-oriented. Other major initiatives to be taken under RTM include the introduction of new tourism packages and programmes like Village Life Experience Package, RT International Conference and Summit and Kerala RT Network,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nRTM comes with three major projects - Clean Vembanad Initiative, Waste-Free Ashtamudi Programme and PEPPER (People\xe2\x80\x99s Participation for Participatory Planning and Empowerment through RT). Experts say such initiatives will bring in community participation and yield the desired results.\n Earlier, the Tourism Directorate had found several anomalies in the way the RT initiative was operating in the state. Noting RT was limited to eight tourist destinations in the state, it also found the lack of a formal setup was spoiling the very concept.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarlier, RT initiatives were limited to eight tourist destinations and were implemented more or less on a project basis by the Kerala Institute of Tourism and Travel Studies. With the introduction of RTM, a change is on the cards as it will come under the direct control of the Tourism Director. Also, the creation of an RT School for supporting academic and research activities in the field of responsible tourism is expected to bring in remarkable changes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer.\nThe state first introduced RT in 2007\n It was limited to only eight tourist destinations - Kumarakom, Thekkady, Kovalam, Vythiri, Kumbalangi, Ambalavayal, Bekal and Muziris\nRs 4.50 crore is the total outlay of RTM to be implemented state-wide\nRT initiative to usher in \n\xef\x80\xbcMore job opportunities for local community members\n \xef\x80\xbcInnovation in tourism products\n \xef\x80\xbcArt and culture protection\n \xef\x80\xbcProtection of traditional livelihood activities\n \xef\x80\xbcWomen empowerment\n \xef\x80\xbcEmpowerment of backward communities and weaker sections\n'

S'About 1,000 people from all walks of life took part in a cultural festival titled \'Namma Bengaluru Habba\' (Our Bengaluru Festival) at the Sankey Tank here on Sunday to create awareness on preserving the environment.\nOrganised by the Karnataka Tourism Department, the fest had about 20 artistes who performed the traditional \'Yakshagana\' theatre, and drum dance \'dollu kunita\', while apart from the street musicians, magicians, jugglers, caricature artists and painters, visitors had an opportunity to cruise around the lake with fly boards and jet skis.\nThere were also 20 stalls and a flea market selling organic produce and eco-friendly products, including terracotta jewellery, natural soaps, millet-based products and jute etc.\n"As environment protection is a cause of concern, it is events like these that will create awareness among public and lead to greater sustainability," said state Information Technology, Biotechnology and Tourism Minister Priyank M. Kharge in a statement. \n"It is great to see so many people participating in support of the cause. The fest is a community building activity to preserve Bengaluru\'s ecology," he added.\n'
