S'Washington: With speculations that the US is planning to extend its drone strike programmes to Pakistan has made it clear that President Donald Trump is considering avenues to crackdown on funded terrorism emanating from the region._line_Just days ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Washington, two senior US Congressmen have introduced a bipartisan bill that is intended to cut ties with Pakistan._line_As per reports Republican Ted Poe and Democrat Rick Nolan, last Friday, introduced a bill for revoking Pakistan Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA). _line_Pakistan had been granted MNNA status way back in 2004 by then US President George W Bush to get Pakistan to help the United States fight al-Qaeda and the Taliban. However, the US has now identified those daily terror activities emerging from Pakistan, as cross-border ceasefire violations have been highlighted by India many times in the past._line_Why the bill? _line_The bill is aimed at making a \xe2\x80\x9cclean breakaway\xe2\x80\x9d from the country that has \xe2\x80\x9charboured terrorists\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9clittle in the way of being accountable for the money given for fighting, eradicating these groups\xe2\x80\x9d._line_One may question the timing of the US bill that seeks to sever ties with Pakistan, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on his way to Washington on Sunday. As per information, PM Modi and Donald Trump are expected to discuss a multitude of issues, ranging from H-1B visas, countering terrorism, and expanding other bilateral ties._line_What is further worrisome for Pakistan is the number of defence deals that India is set to strike with the US, clearly indicating that India and US are fighting alongside each other to counter global terrorism. _line_In the bill, Republican Poe said, "Pakistan must be held accountable for the American blood on its hands."_line_\xe2\x80\x9cFrom harbouring Osama bin Laden to backing the Taliban, Pakistan has stubbornly refused to go after, in any meaningful way, terrorists that actively seek to harm opposing ideologies. We must make a clean break with Pakistan, but at the very least, we should stop providing them with the eligibility to obtain our own sophisticated weaponry," he added._line_Poe aggressively put his points across in the bill that seeks to revoke Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s MNNA rights and Nolan was also on the same page on this subject. He said that Pakistan has time and again taken advantage of America\xe2\x80\x99s goodwill and demonstrated that they are not a friend or ally to the United States._line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, the billions of dollars we have sent to Pakistan over the last 15 years has done nothing to effectively fight terrorism and make us safer. It is time to wake up to the fact that Pakistan has ties to the same terrorist organisations which they claim to be fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d he added._line_'

S'Pune: Hotel prices in foreign tourist destinations are one of the main factors for Indian travellers while planning their vacation. This trend of tourists combining lower hotel prices with the high temperature of a country is on the rise. _line_In 2016, tourists preferred visiting countries where there was a drop by 5 to 25 per cent in hotel prices even if the temperature was high and it was not considered an ideal time to visit._line_This was stated in the 2017 Hotel Pricing Report by TripAdvisor, a travel planning and booking portal. The report revealing global accommodation trends is based on TripAdvisor hotel shopping data. \xe2\x80\x9cThe price conscious Indian is always looking for ways to find the best prices to book, along with saving on time and effort. According to our data, some destinations that offered significant hotel value this year were preferred, compared to last year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikhil Ganju, Country Manager, TripAdvisor India._line_He added that the Caribbean, which is one of the most popular hotel shopping destinations, has seen a four per cent dip in hotel prices, making it a perfect time for Indians to book a dream trip there. _line_In Spain, travellers were able to enjoy low prices and better weather in March, April and November when the prices were between Rs 9,823 to Rs 10,044 per day and the temperature was 12 degrees. The highest price for the hotels was July and August at Rs 16,184 per day. _line_The best season to visit Caribbean is from December to February, but the hotel prices are Rs 34,000 per day on an average at 25 degrees temperature. For Caribbean, travellers found the best price of hotels from August to October, when the temperature was 27.8 degrees, with nightly rates averaging as low as Rs 21,679 per day. Though it was hurricane season, travellers considered purchasing travel insurance._line_Similar trends were seen in visits to Brazil, Mexico and Italy. Brazil was most visited in March, April and May as the hotel prices were Rs 8,600 per day at 24 degrees Celsius. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, for those not willing to go far, Taiwan, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Philippines are great options,\xe2\x80\x9d Ganju added. _line_'

If you want to look down and see a six-pack, you need to do exercises that challenge your entire core._line_Kristina Marcussen, a neuromuscular physical therapist who specializes in working with athletes of all ages, has an easy tip. "If you want to work your core, put your hands on the floor." We\'re talking plank, up-down plank, elbow plank, elbow plank with knee drive, side plank, side plank with a leg lift, push-ups, creepy crawly, and mountain climbers._line_These are examples of closed kinetic chain exercises, where one or both feet or hands remains in constant contact with a surface, usually the ground. These exercises are typically bodyweight moves that use more than one joint and that create some instability in order to "activate more muscles and engage more muscle fibers." These types of exercises also work the muscles that you use in everyday life or sports, so they\'ll not only strengthen your midsection but they\'ll also "help prevent injury" when doing daily activities like carrying groceries or picking up your kid. _line_Kristina recommends incorporating these hands-on-the-ground core exercises into your workouts at least three times a week._line_'

S'It is too early to say whether the recent encounters in Kulgam in the Kashmir Valley mark the revival of the clashes and violence that followed the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in July last year. The cycle of violence had abated after November but the occurrence of three encounters in the last one week, in which 16 people died, is ominous. The dead included eight militants, two civilians and six army personnel. The civilians were killed when they tried to protect militants and the army personnel lost their lives when mobs threw stones at them or prevented their being taken to hospital. The rising trend of people coming to the aid of militants caught in clashes with the army or security forces shows increasing public sympathy for the militants. That has provoked the army, with Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat issuing a controversial warning to the people that those who aided the militants or even raised Pakistan flags would be considered anti-nationals and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe forces would go helter-skelter for them.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Loss of personnel, growth of or lack of abatement of militancy, the need to extend action to more areas and increase in resistance might put more pressure on the armed forces. But the response should not be in anger and the army should not react as if it is in a battlefield fighting the enemy. It should not lose sense of the environment it is in where cooperation of the people is essential for success, and has no reason to abandon standard operating procedures even in the face of extreme provocation. To equate stone-pelting youth and the mobs that shield militants and to deal with them as enemies is to create more militants. The army\xe2\x80\x99s role in a civilian conflict zone is very difficult. Public pronouncement of a threat by the army chief will send out wrong messages about that role both to the people and the personnel. _line_Such an aggressive policy will only confirm the impression that it is the army which is in command in Kashmir and not the civil administration. That will not help in moving towards redress of even common grievances, let alone bringing down the levels of hostility and militancy. No political initiative was taken during the peaking of disaffection and militancy, and its waning in the last few weeks, to relate to the people and to initiate a peace process. Civil authorities should find a solution to the problem of crowds obstructing security operations. It should be a part of a bigger outreach to the people. The army chief\xe2\x80\x99s prescription can only worsen the problem. _line_'

S'Once again, science can\'t stress enough how important sleep is, this time in regards to sexual health. New research presented at the American Urological Association in May looked specifically at sleep disruption from shift work, or employment that doesn\'t follow the 9-to-5 pattern. Shift work requires workers to follow irregular sleep patterns, especially when they take on the graveyard shift. According to WebMD, bad sleep patterns had a trickle-down effect to men\'s sperm count and other bodily functions._line_One study found that men seeking help for infertility were more likely to have lower sperm counts if they were shift workers. "We think that too much or too little sleep alters circadian rhythms and thus changes hormone levels and the expression of genes that are important for producing sperm," noted Dr. Alex Pastuszak, who co-authored the studies. Sleep loss has long been proven to alter hormone levels and metabolic processes, which in turn messes with memory, blood sugar, the cardiovascular system, and the reproductive system. It\'s like fast-tracked aging. Interrupted circadian rhythms are also linked to infertility in women._line_The other two studies gathered survey information from 2,500 men and found the shift workers were more likely to report "worse urinary issues, worse erectile function, and worse symptoms of low testosterone as well as lower testosterone levels," Pastuszak said. Shift work had a bigger impact on these issues than tobacco and alcohol use, exercise, or depression. The research has not yet been peer reviewed, and it did not conclusively prove that shift work resulted in urinary, sperm, and erectile dysfunction issues, so further research is necessary._line_On the bright side, drinking up to four cups of coffee a day doesn\'t negatively impact sperm count or semen quality, so that\'s a small blessing for those with sleep-adverse work schedules._line_ Get Your Good Night\'s Sleeping In While You Can_line_'

S'If you\'re still holding out hope that Lady Gaga and ex-fianc\xc3\xa9 Taylor Kinney will reconcile, we advise you to stop reading right now. According to Us Weekly, the Super Bowl superstar has reportedly started dating her agent, Christian Carino. The Creative Artists Agency agent was spotted at Houston\'s NRG Stadium to support Lady Gaga before she took the stage during her halftime show, planting a kiss on her cheek while she took a few selfies. On Wednesday, the two attended Tommy Hilfiger\'s Spring 2017 runway show in LA, since the designer happens to be a close friend of Christian\'s. Ryan Seacrest asked the "Million Reasons" singer about the potential new love connection on his radio show the next day, but she kept coy. "I don\'t know! You know I don\'t talk about my love life, Ryan!" she said while blushing. "I\'m really red. I\'m really red, and it doesn\'t go with my outfit." Maybe Christian will be her next music video squeeze? _line_'

S'Dubai: Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is weighing a plan to hire investment banks for different stages of its initial public offering, four people with knowledge of the matter said._line_The company \xe2\x80\x94 known as Saudi Aramco \xe2\x80\x94 is talking to banks for a role as financial adviser to review potential listing destinations and prepare the company for the float, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. Banks that do well in that role will then be considered for subsequent stages including underwriting, the people said. Saudi Aramco may re-tender the work if they\xe2\x80\x99re unhappy with a bank\xe2\x80\x99s performance, they said._line_No final decisions have been made on the advisory roles, though Saudi Aramco is expected to mandate banks in coming days, the people said._line_Saudi Aramco asked banks including Goldman Sachs Group and HSBC Holdings to pitch for the advisory role on the IPO, people familiar with the matter said in January. Credit Suisse Group, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were also invited, the people said. Evercore Partners has already been hired to work alongside rival Moelis as a financial adviser on the listing, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month._line_Once banks are mandated for an IPO they typically continue working on it until the point a company lists, though staggered mandates could incentivise the banks as they compete for coveted roles. When Chinese Internet retailer Alibaba Group Holding sold shares in 2014, it awarded about 17 per cent of the deal\xe2\x80\x99s $300 million in fees to banks based on performance, people familiar said at the time. Its sale is the largest ever, raising $25 billion._line_Saudi Arabia plans to sell less than 5 percent of the company as part of plans by the kingdom to set up the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest sovereign wealth fund and reduce the economy\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on hydrocarbons. The kingdom estimates the company could be valued at about $2 trillion, with the share sale expected to dwarf Alibaba\xe2\x80\x99s._line_'

After their awful trip, Scott convinced Bella to hang out again by sending her flowers and texts, we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned EXCLUSIVELY. It worked!_line_It took some convincing for Scott Disick, 32, to get Bella Thorne, 19, back in his life. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hanging out at his pool just randomly, you know! She and Scott are hanging out again because he proved to her that he\xe2\x80\x99s truly sorry for his behavior in Cannes. He went with a tried and true method to get her to like him again: presents!_line_\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a week after the film festival ended Scott started bombarding Bella with apology texts and flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d the source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sent her every color of rose possible, even special rainbow ones because she knows she\xe2\x80\x99s into the whole unicorn thing. He put a lot of thought into it and said all the right things. He apologized for everything and blamed the alcohol like he always does. Bella is very forgiving and Scott can be very charming so it\xe2\x80\x99s not that shocking she\xe2\x80\x99s hanging out with him again.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Hopefully, Scott\xe2\x80\x99s intentions are good and he\xe2\x80\x99s not just leading her on. Scott, as HollywoodLife.com previously told you EXCLUSIVELY, was hooking up with Bella in Cannes to make his ex-partner, Kourtney Kardashian, 38, insanely jealous. He himself was enraged that she was flaunting her love with new, much younger boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, in France at the same time. After that, the entire trip collapsed on itself. Scott and Bella were having a great time together until he went and ruined everything!_line_Scott took Bella along with him on a yacht trip, where they kissed and cuddled on the deck of the luxe boat without caring that cameras could see. Bella couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle Scott\xe2\x80\x99s notorious hard partying. Coupled with the fact that he made out with five other girls, she decided to hightail it out of there. Bella did say that things were \xe2\x80\x9call good\xe2\x80\x9d between them after they got home, but began to spend time with her ex-boyfriend, Gregg Sulkin, 25, while Scott continued to get his groove on in France._line_Needless to say, Scott really needed to step it up and apologize to Bella after what happened. We knew something was up when Bella posted a Snapchat of a beautiful bouquet of pink roses with no caption, and it looks like Scott\xe2\x80\x99s got her smitten again. She was in his backyard pool on June 21 in nothing but a thong bikini, eating a hamburger! It really looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re back on!_line_HollywoodLifers, do you think Bella and Scott will start dating? Let us know!_line_'

"I just think that she has to make it more of a concerted effort and that\'s what she\'s trying to do."_line_Her struggle on the hit show has been well documented, most recently at weight-loss immersion camp, but Chrissy\'s message to the viewers and anyone trying to lose weight is important: not shedding pounds does not mean you\'ve failed, it\'s all part of the journey._line_She said that her character\'s storyline is not meant to discourage anyone trying to lose weight, in fact, it\'s the opposite. "I think it inspires people because we\'re all on different journeys and we all progress differently," Chrissy said.

Breaking the law, there are 307 tobacco selling shops that operate within 100 yards of 122 schools. 30% don\xe2\x80\x99t have an operating license at all.

Symphony No 8, Le Soir, joins their earlier recordings of Le Matin and Le Midi to complete the Esterh\xc3\xa1zy trilogy of 1761. It follows the others in its concerto grosso pattern, with some fine solo work from all parts of the orchestra (and lovely, though uncredited, theorbo playing). Aisslinn Nosky makes us listen anew to the Violin Concerto in A major, and the wind section excels in the sophisticated Symphony No 84. Yet, while the quality of playing by this American musical institution is never in question nor the deftness of its direction, this disc never really gets the pulse racing._line_'

S'Gradle, the build system of choice for Android mobile development, has been upgraded with better support for building Java applications._line_Gradle 3.4 offers fast incremental results and "the end of dreaded compile classpath leakage," said Cedric Champeau, a software engineer who has worked on developing the tool. Changes in the upgrade can dramatically improve build times, he said._line_Classpath leakage refers to elements on the classpath of a library required for compiling sources leaking to the classpath of dependent libraries or applications. To halt this problem, a separation is introduced between the "api" and "implementation" configurations, so dependent projects only see the classpath from the api configuration; hence, only the libraries necessary to use the public-facing interfaces to the library see it. Implementation-specific external libraries would be on the "implementation" classpath and not visible to the dependent library\'s compile classpath._line_The upgrade\'s compile avoidance capability is enabled by a mechanism that offers up-to-date checking of Java compilation sensitive to public API changes only. If a comment or even a private API is changed in a downstream project, Java compilation for upstream projects will be up to date._line_An experimental incremental compiler featured previously becomes stable in the 3.4 upgrade. It also offers better performance. The compiler, which will become the default soon, leverages in-memory caches living in the Gradle daemon across builds, thus making it significantly faster, Champeau said._line_Gradle 3.4 also features a Java library plugin for building a component for use as a dependency from another project. This provides a stronger separation between public and private code and improves performance and enforces architectural boundaries on the build level._line_'

Yesterday evening (during Australia\xe2\x80\x99s second innings) when the ball was hard, it was turning a lot faster, even this morning it was doing so but in the second session it was not so hard, so to generate pace off the wicket becomes difficult for a bowler.

The minister was accompanied by senior administrative officials including Godda deputy commissioner Bhuwanesh Pratap Singh and his subordinates. _line_ "Since the primitive tribal beneficiaries of the food security scheme fail to avail the facility of free distribution of food grains through the public distribution system (PDS), the state government has decided to ensure the food supply at their doorsteps," Lois said, adding that the government will also check the alleged malpractice of distribution of less quantity of food grains to through PDS shops. _line_ The timing and selection of the place to launch the scheme, however, sparked another controversy with opposition parties viewing it as an attempt to win over the electorate in violation of the model code of conduct. _line_ "Pahadiyas comprise a significant populace in Littipara assembly constituency and the launching of the scheme in its bordering parts is aimed at influencing the electorate of the community," Vijay Singh, central committee member of JMM, said. _line_'

S' If you are a professional videographer you very likely know the company RED. It makes high quality sensors and modular camera setups but now also apparently smartphones. _line_However, RED\'s approach isn\'t simply to plop out another Android clone that no one will remember in a month. The phone that they call Hydrogen One is said to have a 5.7 inch, no glasses needed holographic display, whatever that means, and it will be able to produce 3D, VR, AR and RED\'s own "4-view" content. It also can convert simple stereo sound into so-called multi-dimensional audio. _line_The pins at the bottom of the picture also seem to confirm what has been revealed by RED\'s patents that the phone is also modular. You\'ll be able to attach modifications in the same way as with Moto Mods and one can only imagine what type of camera addons RED might have planned. _line_All this seems fairly crazy, right? Well, at this point we only really have their word for it because the company hasn\'t revealed much at all about the device. There\'s really just one picture, the aforementioned details about its capabilities, and means to pre-order the device. _line_Oh, and that brings us to the price. The starting price for the Hydrogen One is $1195, that\'s called the Aluminum version. If you want the Titanium version you\'ll have to shell out an extra $400. _line_Red Hydrogen One is expected to ship in Q1 2018 but I\'d be surprised if we don\'t hear more about it before that. _line_'

S" Photo: Reuters_line_  In what could be a relief to millions of farmers and the government, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said severe cold wave conditions are likely in Punjab, Haryana and northern Rajasthan from Tuesday till the morning of Saturday. This, after the slight drizzle over most of North India since Friday, could be a lifeline for the standing wheat and mustard crops, facing moisture stress due to a warmer than usual winter.  _line_ IMD had said last month that temperatures in all sub-divisions were likely to be warmer than normal between December and February. _line_ The unusual weather impelled a review meeting recently at the ministry of agriculture. It reportedly decided to wait till the end of January and watch the situation closely. There would be problems if temperatures increase during the wheat crop maturing stage, after January. Apparently, every one-degree Celsius rise in average temperature pulls down the wheat yield by 10%. The average wheat yield in India is three to four tonnes a hectare; Punjab's is six to seven tonnes a hectare._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cThe wheat crop is at the growing state in many places and a prolonged warm period for the next 15-20 days would have been really bad for the final yields,\xe2\x80\x9d a senior agriculture scientist said. _line_ IMD in its Monday forecast said cold wave conditions are also likely over West UP from Tuesday morning to Friday morning. and ground frost is likely at pockets over Punjab, Haryana and north Rajasthan in the same period. Several parts of the north have had a light drizzle, lowering the temperature by half to one degree Celsius._line_ Till last week, it was estimated that wheat had been planted on 30.31 mn ha, about 7.6% more than in the same period last year. _line_ However, with ongoing cash crunch in many areas, many farmers say they have used old seeds._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cOverall temperatures across the country would be above normal, while in North India, which only experiences cold waves, the number of such spells would be fewer this year,\xe2\x80\x9d IMD chief K J Ramesh had told this newspaper last month. _line_"

S'Animal welfare groups criticize owl cafes in Japan as the country experiences a boom in animal restaurants. Since owls are considered a symbol of good luck, these cafes are gaining popularity. But being a nocturnal animal, this disturbs their sleep cycle. The birds\xe2\x80\x99 feet are also kept tied. Animal welfare activists feel that this amounts to animal abuse. Owls are birds of prey and crowded cafe conditions are difficult for them. They are used to flying long distances at night to hunt and their keen hearing and vision make it hard to adjust to bright and noisy venues. However, cafe owners say that they are aware of the issues and are making efforts to keep the birds stress free. (Reuters)_line_'
