S'Hyderabad: Following the intervention of Union minister for women and child development Maneka Gandhi in the case of Oman national Ahmed marrying a teenager from the old city, the police has handed over the investigation to an ACP rank official. This is the first time the police has handed over investigation of a case relating to woman trafficking to an ACP. Falaknuma ACP Mohd Tajuddin Ahmed is now the investigation officer in the case._line_Moreover, serious sections of IPC and other laws have also been invoked in the case. The police say they are seriously tackling women trafficking cases following instructions from DGP Anurag Sharma. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are invoking all serious sections in such cases including the new rape act and buying women for slavery in all cases of women complaining about cheating after offering huge amounts. For minors, Pocso and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act are also being invoked,\xe2\x80\x9d said DCP, south, V. Satyanarayana._line_In the recent case involving the \xe2\x80\x98marriage\xe2\x80\x99 of a 16-year-old-girl with a 65-year-old Omani, the police invoked Pocso, the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, cheating, rape and other IPC sections. In another case of a Dubai national marrying a 30-year-old woman, the police invoked Section 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave) and Section 493 (Cohabitation by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage and to cohabit or have sexual intercourse with her) of IPC._line_Mailardevpally inspector P. Jagaadeshwar said the complaint attracts the Sections and hence they had registered a case. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are showing zero tolerance towards cases of women trafficking in the garb of marriage. A large part of our jurisdiction has poor migrants from other states and brokers are trying to exploit their poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Jagaadeshwar said._line_Women activists said that the police earlier invoked only cheating clauses in cases of woman being cheated by foreign nationals while in cases of minor girls being married off the police registered cases under the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act. \xe2\x80\x9cThe police approach has changed in the last two cases reported this month. We appreciate it but at the same time we want the police to break the broker network in the city. Otherwise, they will go to adjoining districts and continue their trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jameela Nishath of the Shaheen Women Resource and Welfare Association._line_'

I have been working in a factory inside the dera. We have been living in fear since August 25 as the police and the Army are around. All residents are avoiding coming outside." _line_ Another dera follower Naveen Kumar of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, who has been residing in the dera, was evacuated by the police. A laptop and some money were recovered from him. Naveen said, "I worked here as an electrician and was living here for the last four months." _line_'

S'PV Sindhu with her mentor Pullala Gopichand at her felicitation ceremony on National Sports Day (BCCL image)_line_ HYDERABAD: Despite PV Sindhu winning many titles, her coach Pullela Gopichand has always maintained that she is not yet a complete player. Ever after she won the Olympic silver last year, Gopichand had said that Sindhu is still in the process of becoming a complete player. _line_ But after watching the lion-hearted display of Sindhu in the epic World Championships final, rated by many as the best ever singles match, Gopichand appears to have changed his opinion. Though he stopped short of describing his trainee as a complete player, he said that Sindhu is now becoming consistent. _line_  "She has won three medals at the Worlds, which is phenomenal. She bagged an Olympic silver and Super Series titles. So she has progressed a lot. But the good thing for us is there are still a lot many areas we can improve in Sindhu\'s game. That is the most interesting part," Gopichand said adding that once Sindhu masters these aspects it will be difficult to stop her. _line_ "She is just 22 and by improving other areas in her game she can win many gold medals and titles," said Gopichand after he arrived to grand welcome along with Sindhu and Saina Nehwal at the Hyderabad airport. _line_ Sindhu said that she has recovered from the heart-breaking loss. "I was very upset but soon recovered and people around me helped me overcome that sad feeling. Sometimes after such a loss, we don\'t sleep well, but I am used to these things," Sindhu said. _line_ Asked why she didn\'t play her trademark aggressive game against Nozomi Okuhara in the final, Sindhu said: "Though I am an attacking player I just can\'t hit all the time. They will also be ready for all the shots. With Okuhara we have to play the rally game, we have to adopt a different strategy." _line_ Reiterating that her target is to become No.1in the world, Sindhu said that badminton is changing fast. "My target is to become No.1 and win many more titles. I need to work very hard to be at the top level. It\'s not going to be easy. We have to fight for every point and we need take care of our fitness," Sindhu said. _line_ Queried on what she thinks about people comparing her with Sachin Tendulkar and for changing the focus of the nation from cricket to badminton, Sindhu said: "Since Rio Olympics there is a lot of focus on badminton. But we should not compare sports. Sachin is a great person and badminton is a completely different sport. But it is good to know that some people are looking up to me and getting inspired. I know I have a lot to do in future." _line_'

S'In 2010, Vinod Mangeshkar had a bypass surgery for which he had to borrow Rs 7 lakh from a few of his acquaintances. In order to repay the amount, he started working as a security guard on a salary of Rs 7,000 per month._line_Vinod Mangeshkar had to repay loan that he had taken for his bypass surgery. Sandip Daundkar_line_In a 200-odd-sq-ft house in the PMC Colony near Dandekar Bridge, resides 60-year-old Vinod Mangeshkar. Undeterred by the limited space, Mangeshkar can be seen sitting in a corner with his colour palette and a canvas, busy drawing a portrait of Raj Thackeray. The tiny room houses various brilliantly-done colourful works by Mangeshkar, who spends his time painting during the day and works as a security guard in a shop at Sadashiv Peth in the evenings. Interestingly, once upon a time, he worked as a backdrop stage artiste for Bollywood films like Waqt, Jhuk Gaya Aasman, Brahmchari, Love in Tokyo, Raaz and others._line_In 2010, Mangeshkar had a bypass surgery for which he had to borrow Rs 7 lakh from a few of his acquaintances. In order to repay the amount, he started working as a security guard on a salary of Rs 7,000 per month. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to run the house with my painting work. Firstly, there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee of income. Secondly, even if I am able to sell a painting or two, the profit margin is bare minimum,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mangeshkar, who stays in PMC Colony with his wife. His 27-year-old daughter is married. The Mangeshkars earlier stayed in a slum and were allotted their current house in a slum redevelopment programme._line_Sharing his journey so far, he says that in 1961, when he was around 7, his parents passed away in the Panshet Dam flood. His father\xe2\x80\x99s friend took him to Delhi. After two years, when he too passed away, Mangeshkar was left homeless. He would make his living with the pencil sketches made by him that he sold outside Teen Murti Bhavan. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a few years, a man who had an eye for art, noticed my work and asked me to go to Mumbai. He even gave me Rs 50 to sponsor my train ticket. In Mumbai, I started working as a backdrop artiste under art director Sudhendu Roy at Kaardhar Studio who paid me a rupee per day. The amount was sufficient for me at that time. I got to make backdrop works for many famous Hindi films. Unfortunately, the studio broke down after two years and I was again jobless. I had to do odd jobs \xe2\x80\x94 of a labourer, carpenter, waiter, building painter and so on. But I never lost touch with painting,\xe2\x80\x9d he says._line_A few months ago, Pune\xe2\x80\x99s Rahul Khismatrao, who\xe2\x80\x99s currently an intern at NASA in the UK, started a crowdfunding campaign for Mangeshkar. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I met him, I was studying electronics engineering in Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune, where he was working as a security guard. So, when he showed me his portraits and told me about his debts that he took for his bypass, I started a fundraiser on Milaap,\xe2\x80\x9d says Khismatrao. So far, nearly Rs 4.7 lakh has been raised._line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe painting orders have reduced drastically. For instance, during Ganeshotsav, various Ganesh Mandals would ask me to paint their backdrops. Now, they get digital print which are faster. Thankfully, I have a roof over my head and my daughter is happily married. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult. I just want to repay the borrowed money now as soon as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he says._line_'

The key to a good stretch is to find that balance between discomfort and pain._line_\xe2\x80\x9cStretch to where it\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable but you\xe2\x80\x99re not hurting,\xe2\x80\x9d Clayton advises. \xe2\x80\x9cI suggest that my clients focus on diaphragmatic breathing during their stretching.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  5 of 7  _line_4. Rehydrate_line_ Antonios Mitsopoulos / Getty_line_The body sweats to cool itself down as you\xe2\x80\x99re blasting through a grueling workout. Without refilling the fluids you\xe2\x80\x99re losing through sweat (and urine), you\xe2\x80\x99ll get dehydrated._line_\xe2\x80\x9cSweating out 2% of your bodyweight will translate to negative affects on performance,\xe2\x80\x9d Clayton says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll notice the effects most during cardio. So if running a seven-minute mile is relatively easy for you, when you\xe2\x80\x99re dehydrated, the body and heart will be working harder to achieve that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Proper hydration regulates body temperature and lubricates the joints; it can also help stave off constipation. Thirst is typically a delayed indicator that you\xe2\x80\x99re dehydrated. But how can you tell for sure? Use the pee test._line_\xe2\x80\x9cIf your urine is clear or light yellow, like a lemonade, you\xe2\x80\x99re in good status,\xe2\x80\x9d Clayton reveals. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s yellow or bright yellow, that\xe2\x80\x99s when dehydration is creeping in.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  6 of 7  _line_5. Consume Protein_line_jorgegonzalez / Getty_line_While we advocate consuming protein within an hour after your workout to begin repairing damaged muscles, Clayton says the timing of protein consumption isn\xe2\x80\x99t critical._line_\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to eat protein within 30 minutes of your workout,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cMost research shows that it comes down to your overall protein intake throughout the day. The anabolic window for the body to recover is anywhere from 24-36 hours after your workout, so consistent feeding and getting protein and essential amino acids in every meal is what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to do. The problem is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make recommendations [on protein amounts] because it depends on things like your fitness goals and body size.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  7 of 7  _line_6. Wear Compression Clothing_line_Ian Spanier / Getty_line_There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason the medical community has fitted patients with things like compression stockings for years: Compression garments\xe2\x80\x94such as pants, sleeves, and socks\xe2\x80\x94can help reduce toxins in the muscle, improve circulation, and aid recovery._line_\xe2\x80\x9cWear [the compression clothing] for about three hours after your workout; you\xe2\x80\x99ll get more oxygenated blood in the muscles and it will help remove any leftover metabolic waste.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_However, be wary of claims that compression clothes enhance athletic performance.

S' As health-conscious humans, we\'re constantly sifting through the research about whether organic food is better. And as pet parents, we always want to put the best in our pups\' bowls. But does organic matter as much for dogs, or is it just another marketing ploy? After doing a lot of digging, I discovered that it\'s often not all it\'s cracked up to be for pups. Here\'s what you need to know before buying:_line_"Organic" dog food is not well regulated_line_ One of the biggest issues with buying your pup organic is that, unlike for human food, there aren\'t great standards in place: the USDA has yet to define "organic" as it applies to pet foods, so the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) sets the standards for the National Organic Program (NOP), and the individual states are supposed to regulate them_line_ An "organic dog food" label can be misleading_line_ Technically, the NOP mandates that if companies want the coveted organic seal on the food, at least 95 percent of the food must be organic by weight. Labels can say they\'re "made with organic ingredients" if at least 70 percent of the ingredients are organic. Here\'s where it gets tricky: pet food companies can say they\'re organic even when their food doesn\'t contain organic ingredients because no agency requires proof of the pet food health claims._line_ It may be "organic," but still not healthy_line_ Unfortunately, being "organic" does not guarantee that food is good for your pup: Even if what you buy does contain organic ingredients, they may have been heavily processed in order to make the food shelf stable (thus stripping them of their nutritional value.) Plus, according to Greg Aldrich, PhD, research associate professor and pet food program coordinator at Kansas State University, it\'s difficult to secure the raw ingredients to produce a truly organic pet food within the framework of the AAFCO guidelines. So the food may be organic, but not nutritionally complete._line_  You may be paying more unnecessarily_line_  The word "organic" is often used to increase the seeming value of the food (and to charge you more!). But because the commercial dog food category is still lacking in strict regulations, there are some organic brands that are using chemicals and preservatives in their food. Others will slap on an organic label without being completely honest about their ingredients. So you might be paying more for food that isn\'t worth it.  _line_Organic ingredients aren\'t necessarily better for dogs_line_ "There is no documented positive, nutritional, health, or safety benefits to organic," Aldrich says. There have been studies about the pros and cons of grains, raw food, and specific ingredients, but research on organic ingredients in a dog\'s diet is surprisingly lacking. So we really don\'t know \xe2\x80\x94 they could be healthier for pups or they could be the same. What we do know? The most important thing is that your dog eat a healthy diet made with real, high-quality ingredients that are nutritionally balanced. Think about it: Would you rather eat organic gummi bears or a fresh salad with ingredients that aren\'t all organic? Exactly._line_'

A new insight will occur to you or your viewpoint may be influenced by another person who may be a complete stranger. What you will learn and understand about yourself can play a key role in shaping your future life and your way of dealing with a pressing issue in your life which is preoccupying you right now._line_READ MORE: https://24indianews.com/shocked-man-found-shot-dead-gurugram/_line_ Gemini Daily Horoscope for Today 30 August 2017:_line_ You are going to put every effort in resolving a central issue which is dominating your life right now.

Patience is the key here._line_ Cancer Daily Horoscope for Today 30 August 2017:_line_Today is particularly favourable for you. You can start something new, finish a project which had been taking up a lot of your time or take up a task which you have been putting off. Fun and games are on the card for the evening. Connect with friends, old and new and enjoy. Shopping can be especially fun today._line_Leo Daily Horoscope for Today 30 August 2017:_line_ You are Self reflection is the key today. You may feel an unrest which you cannot express or a discontent, even though everything works out all right for you.

This seems to be your theme for the day and it is absolutely apt too! The day can begin with regular work routine but may end with celebration with close friends and family! You have a great sense of humor so you can choose to host large scale events too!_line_Aquarius Daily Horoscope for Today 30 August 2017:_line_ You have a crisp tongue and a logical mind. But this ability of yours may suffer today due to your insecure nature. Try to go with the flow instead of opposing it like always. Experience will teach you a lot more worthy lessons which the satiation of your ego can never. Later on you will be at ease and will be full of confidence._line_Pisces Daily Horoscope for Today 30 August 2017:_line_ The time is right to turn your attention to materialistic comforts. Enjoy your social life now and get in touch with old friends or family members from whom you have not heard for a long time. You will also experience a shift in your consciousness which may come gradually or which may descend on you without warning. It is a good idea to listen to your instincts now._line_'

S'Delano Seiveright_line_Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett._line_ WESTERN BUREAU:_line_ Jamaica\'s thrust to significantly increase visitor arrivals will be boosted by a strategic partnership with search engine giants Google, Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett has announced._line_ Bartlett, who last Thursday met and toured with the leadership of Google at the company\'s headquarters (Googleplex) in Silicon Valley, California, said Jamaica\'s tourism stands to gain big time with this arrangement, calling Google the most visited website in the world._line_ "Google is where everybody goes to search for things," Bartlett pointed out. "Also worth noting is the 10 per cent increase in queries from persons in the United States for 2017 when compared to the corresponding period last year."_line_ The minister, who was joined on the tour by Senior Advisor/Strategist Delano Seiveright, and Jamaica\'s Honorary Consul to Los Angeles, Lorna Robinson, added that people should not fear the potential impact that technology driven companies can have on the tourism and travel industry as they "represent reality now and the future"._line_ "We should cement ways in which we can partner with these companies to diversify our offerings and appeal to a greater audience of potential new visitors," Bartlett further added._line_ Google, in its presentation to the Jamaican delegation, highlighted the scope of its work with government institutions worldwide and broad statistical overviews of search traffic about Jamaica and the Caribbean and select Latin American countries on a whole._line_ "Google presented in fairly good detail how exclusive (anonymous) data/insights, for example, query trends and on how people in the United States and Canada tend to search for Jamaica; the keywords and attributes they look for, which other tourism destinations persons search for after or before searching for Jamaica and so on," Seiveright, pointed out._line_ LUXURY VACATIONS_line_ "Among some of the noteworthy facts is that people in the market of trips to the Caribbean belong to the highest income households in the USA vis-\xe2\x80\xa1-vis other digital users. That there are three million monthly queries on Google.com about Jamaica in the US; that Jamaica ranks near the top of searches for \'luxury vacations\', and that the US audience with household income above average or exceeding US$75,000 a year, showing interest on travelling soon to the Caribbean, is really a big deal," he said._line_ Edmund Bartlett further noted that using Google as a marketing tool reinforced the need to deeply analyse external and public online tools while looking at "digital best practices from other tourism institutions, on how to really maximise the use and power of digital and data to attract more tourists, more efficiently to Jamaica"._line_ In addition to Google, Bartlett and his team also toured San Francisco and the wider Silicon Valley areas in California to engage in strategic meetings with representatives from international technology-heavyweights Airbnb, LinkedIn, and Uber._line_'

S'After living side by side with humans for tens of thousands of years, dogs have become our closest animal companions. So perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that they have developed a range of seemingly human characteristics. Do they think like us too? Gregory Berns of Emory University has tackled this question by placing dozens of dog volunteers into an fMRI brain scanner to see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in their brains in a variety of situations._line_New Scientist rounds up seven traits that illustrate just how close to human our best friends are becoming._line_1. Deceptive beasts_line_Dogs know what they like, and are not above feeding humans misinformation to get it. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, dogs are not above subtle subterfuge, especially when there\xe2\x80\x99s a sausage at stake. In experiments, they will mislead competitors \xe2\x80\x93 directing them away from hidden treats \xe2\x80\x93 if it means they\xe2\x80\x99ll wind up with more chow in the end._line_2. Moral imperative_line_They are famous for their blind loyalty, but dogs are more discerning than you might think \xe2\x80\x93 they prefer people that they see helping their owner. The experiment went like this. Each owner tried to open a container then presented it to one of two actors. This actor either helped or refused to do so, while the other actor was passive. When the two actors subsequently offered the dog a treat, the dog was more likely to take the treat from the passive actor if the first actor had refused to help its owner open the container._line_3. Jealous guys_line_No one likes to feel like they\xe2\x80\x99re getting the raw end of a deal, and dogs are no exception. If they decide that other dogs are getting preferential treatment, they throw their bones out of the pram and stop playing nice. How do we know this? First, dogs were trained to extend their paws on request. The animals would perform the trick almost every time, regardless of reward or if standing alongside another dog. Their enthusiasm quickly waned, though, when they saw the other dog being rewarded for doing the trick when they were receiving nothing themselves. The \xe2\x80\x9cwronged\xe2\x80\x9d dogs started refusing to cooperate, and started showing symptoms of stress, such as licking or scratching themselves._line_4. My word, what a vocab_line_When it comes to a grasp of words, dogs know their stuff. In 2010 we reported on a border collie called Chaser that had learned the names of over 1000 items \xe2\x80\x93 more than any other non-human. She could also categorise them by function and shape, something kids learn around age 3. Give that dog a Scooby snack._line_5. Intention detectors_line_When dogs learn new tricks from other dogs, they do not simply copy what they see, but interpret the goals and intentions of the dog they are watching, then act accordingly. In an experiment, a Border collie showed untrained dogs how to pull a lever for a biscuit using her paw. If she did it while carrying a ball in her mouth, the dogs in her audience would instead tug the lever with their mouths when their turn arrived: they seemed to be thinking she had used her paw only because her mouth was otherwise engaged. Yet when a fresh doggy audience saw the collie pull the lever for a biscuit while carrying nothing in her mouth, virtually all of them used their paws when given a chance to tug the lever for food. It just goes to show our furry friends possess a human-like ability to understand their peers._line_6. Listen up_line_When humans and dogs hear vocal sounds like laughter and barking, their brains respond in the same way. This was discovered by a team who, like Berns, placed a selection of trained dogs in an MRI scanner, as well as people. Both species listened to recordings of canine and human social sounds while their brain activity was monitored. The result suggests that the vocal processing area of the brain evolved just once in a common ancestor \xe2\x80\x93 at least 100 million years ago._line_7. Furry inferences_line_Dogs can learn words by inference, in the same way that human toddlers do. For instance, if you show a small child a green block and a red block, then ask them to hand you the \xe2\x80\x9cchromium\xe2\x80\x9d block, not the red one \xe2\x80\x93 most will offer the green one, despite not knowing that \xe2\x80\x9cchromium\xe2\x80\x9d is a shade of green. Dogs can infer meaning in just the same way. Not only that, they make use of human gestures to a level similar to human infants._line_'

S' Illustration oracle Saumin Suresh Patel sketches out the fantastical world of fandoms and the artistry behind it _line_Anyone who brainstorms India\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names in comic artistry has to name Saumin Suresh Patel, known by his alias Pictorial Cinema. The Mumbai-based artist is on board with Comic Con India\xe2\x80\x99s (CCI) Fandom Month to celebrate the roles comic books play in pop culture, having just taught a short workshop in Hyderabad\xe2\x80\x99s Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University. _line_With a plethora of works already under his belt, Saumin\xe2\x80\x99s passion conveys he\xe2\x80\x99s only just getting started; he has worked on Parle G\xe2\x80\x99s G Man, has produced artwork for Agent Vinod: The Jungfrau Encounter as well as the provocatively sensual Kaamotsav which is influenced by ancient Indian temple and mural art._line_Origin story_line_As a kid, Saumin wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one to mug up in school; he knew art was in his future and his father, a photographer, encouraged this pursuit, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father enabled a lot of things for me in this direction, making sure I attended my art exams and later gathered all information and was always with me as I got admission into Sir J J Institute of Applied Arts in Mumbai. Looking back, I consider myself supremely lucky to have a father who made sure I got to peruse art as a career.\xe2\x80\x9d _line_He adds that mentors out of college also propelled him further into this fantastical realm, expanding his creative horizons. _line_Like any avid creator, he has an intense creative process, making sure there is a clear line of communication between him and his client, \xe2\x80\x9cWith all this information I then sit and thumbnail a few ideas; these are often roughly coloured to get a sense of the overall piece. _line_I then share these with the client to get feedback. The final piece is drawn, then inked and coloured. A usual full page illustration could take a couple of days to a couple of weeks to curate. For comics that I draw for, an average of three days per page are required from thumbnails to final coloured page.\xe2\x80\x9d And seeing the final product is worth it; Saumin has mastered the formula of other-worldly allure in everything he does._line_When creating Kaamotsav, Saumin enjoyed a much slower process, ensuring the subject matter of eroticism is treated well, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a thin line between erotic and vulgar or sensual and obscene; while working on my erotic art one of my concern is to create imagery that is sensual and poetic. A lot of these sketches are done and I let them be for some time and do work on other projects. When I come back to these images after a break, I get to see these with new eyes. It helps.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The workshop he conducted on August 30 at JNAFAU presented a behind the scenes look at the creation a comic. Saumin points out that seeing a final and polished product isn\xe2\x80\x99t always representative of the actual process, \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be intermediating to readers who are contemplating about making their own comics... They got to see the steps involved in making a finished comic, and there were quite a few students who wanted to know more, and I hope some of them make their own comics in coming years.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_For love of fandoms_line_CCI has quite the lead-up of festivities to the much-loved final convention, and Saumin is happy to engender the artistic movements involved, explaining CCI is making big moves to unite various subcultures through a unique hardcore fanbase. He commends the support of creators interacting with fans\xe2\x80\x94 same fans who continue to keep this universe alive._line_Saumin confides he sees a bright future for comic culture in the country, commenting that the superhero films and series have furthered this movement, \xe2\x80\x9cManga from Japan is big in India\xe2\x80\x94 so readers and fans are embracing lots of great content currently. Now local creators will need to create local content which can match up to the evolved taste of current fans\xe2\x80\x94 which is also happening with so many new artists and writers making their own comics in India. I guess there will be newer creators coming in and making some new comics more often now, and maybe in a decade or two we will have a solid body of locally created comics and creators both writers and artists.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_'

S"Summary_line_Recent geopolitical instability in Poland has withdrawn investor attention away from the burgeoning growth of the Polish economy._line_Determining the reasons for the success of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s early institutional reforms serves to enlighten essential areas for continued development._line_A step by step evaluation of current geopolitical and economic risks demonstrates the investment potential of Poland's key productive sectors._line_Investment Summary_line_Recent geopolitical instability in Poland has withdrawn investor attention away from the burgeoning growth of the Polish economy. This article has two key aims. The first objective is to evaluate Poland\xe2\x80\x99s transformation from a distressed communist nation to a leading emerging market. Determining the reasons for the success of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s early institutional reforms serves to enlighten essential areas for continued development. The second objective is to evaluate Poland\xe2\x80\x99s current economic prospects amidst recently strained relations with Brussels. Recent pessimism over Poland\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain fiscal discipline are argued to be in contrast to prevailing economic data._line_Poland\xe2\x80\x99s Transformation_line_In June of 1989, Poland was peering into the chasm of complete economic collapse. Widespread food shortages choked off labor productivity, while the inflation rate peaked at 639.6%. Even a tumbling zloty failed to promote export competitiveness, as state-owned monopolies lacked efficiency and relied on nearly obsolete technology. With 20% of Poles unemployed, the monthly pay of remaining laborers declined to as low as $20 USD. A regime change was inexorable._line_Fortunately, Finance Minister of Poland Leszek Balcerowicz moved quickly to restore stability. The aptly named \xe2\x80\x9cBalcerowicz Plan\xe2\x80\x9d established the independence of the national central bank, abolished preferential treatment for state-owned companies, removed price controls, and opened Poland to private investment. Initially, the gutting of state-owned monopolies resulted in the loss of 1.1 million jobs. A widespread drop in industrial output and gross domestic product earned the Balcerowicz Plan the identifier of \xe2\x80\x9cshock therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_However, the drastic limitation of state influence over price-fixing and removal of subsidies to industries such as coal and petroleum quickly brought internal debt to 3% of GDP. By 1992, earlier job losses were completely extinguished as more than 600,000 private companies provided jobs for approximately 1.5 million people. Hyperinflation too was tamed, as inflation fell from 250% in 1990 to 10% by 2000._line_A Closer Look at Privatization_line_Since the economic liberalization of 1990, Poland has joined a small group of countries which have managed to avoid crises in 25 years. In fact, Poland was the only European Union Nation to avoid a recession through the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Taking into account purchasing power parity, Poland has averaged a GDP per capita growth rate of 6% over the last 20 years, the highest in Eastern Europe. How did Poland achieve the capacity to expand industrial output so rapidly? The extant literature provides only preliminary clues._line_Blanchard, 1997 and Gomulka, 1998 highlight the creation of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s thriving private sector. By early 1990, more than half of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s economy and over three-fourths of the country\xe2\x80\x99s farmland was privately owned. By 2001, over 6,800 state-owned enterprises had been involved in the privatization process, and the private sector grew to account for more than 70 percent of GDP._line_Improved transparency, corporate governance, and productivity in these firms was crucial in unlocking the potential of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s working population. Weisberg and Socha demonstrate that not only did privatization circumvent the deficiencies of unprofitable state-monopolies, it also promoted earnings 9.8% higher than those in the public sector. In short, from both a physical and human capital perspective, higher returns are stimulated by greater private sector activity._line_Nevertheless, the privatization of large industries was far slower than anticipated. Gomulka 2016 notes that state ownership receded not due to bankruptcy and privatization, but due to a fall in state-owned production and employment. After rapid small-scale privatization of retail shops by 1992, it took until 1994 for the Mass Privatization Program (MPP) to begin to the transform just 500 large and medium-sized firms. The MPP created 15 national investment funds, or NIFs. Each NIF contained a broad range of enterprises and was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. By 2011, more than 300 sizable conglomerates still remained under state ownership. Three major Polish conglomerates including PGE Polska Grupa (Poland\xe2\x80\x99s largest power supplier), PZU (Poland\xe2\x80\x99s top insurer), and Tauron (Poland\xe2\x80\x99s second largest energy utility) only saw initial public offerings in 2010._line_Investment in Poland_line_Liberalization of prices improved allocation of resources in smaller private sector businesses. However, it was the attraction of foreign direct investment to remaining large-scale public operations that created sustainable macroeconomic growth. From 1995 to 2010, various European neighbors were drawn to Poland\xe2\x80\x99s low-cost, high-skilled labor and geographic advantages. Overall, Poland received more foreign direct investment than any other previously socialist European country, increasing from $89 million in 1990 to $178 billion by 2012._line_In Lodz, foreign investment transformed the area into the largest white goods production center in Europe. Meanwhile, Germany invested nearly $113 billion in Poland as recently as 2013, or 17% of total FDI. At the same time, German investment of $113 billion in 2013 alone grew Poland\xe2\x80\x99s automotive manufacturing sector to 10% of total output. Only around 37% of Poland's banking sector is domestically owned, with various European multinationals controlling the flow of credit in and out of the country._line_Moden et al.\xe2\x80\x99s landmark 2007 study found that foreign privatized firms realized larger productivity gains than all types of domestic firms. From 1995 to 2000, foreign privatized firms across all industries averaged 46% higher labor productivity than state-owned firms._line_Meanwhile, lower foreign investment into Polish agriculture over the same period has drastically reduced competitiveness in food production. The Heritage Foundation notes that while the agriculture sector employs 15% of working Poles, it contributes only 4% to the country\xe2\x80\x99s GDP._line_Evidently, while the rise of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic private sector was instrumental in enhancing output, foreign direct investment played an equally important role. With Poland\xe2\x80\x99s level of R&D expenditure to GDP ranking among the worst in all of Europe, reliance on foreign innovation and credit is crucial to sustaining current economic growth._line_Poland Today: A Contrarian Investment Prospect_line_An analysis of the key structural underpinnings of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s continued economic renaissance reveals that, despite EU concern, Poland remains a glowing economic prospect._line_Geopolitical Concerns: Risk_line_Poland experienced a major shift in the political sphere in October 2015, when the right-leaning PiS party swept the government in favor of the Civic Platform. Since their victory, the PiS government initially instigated conflict with the EU for expanding state-control over the media. Within months of establishing party majority, the PiS passed a law that gives it the right to name heads of radio stations and public TV._line_PiS efforts to impose conservative, Roman Catholic principles on Polish society have also incited protests involving thousands of Poles. The primary cause of public outcry was legislation aimed at restricting abortion privileges. Street protests again stirred the nation when the PiS pushed through three bills aiming to:_line_ Force all sitting judges on the Supreme Court to step down and given the minister of justice the power to replace them. Dissolve the National Council of the Judiciary--the body that nominates judges--and give parliament the power to determine the makeup of its successor. Transfer the power to appoint the heads of local courts to the Minister of Justice._line_The EU threatened instituting sanctions against the Polish state in response to such judicial reform, viewing the bills as a threat to judicial independence and the core tenets of democracy. Consolidation of judicial authority risks bringing back regulatory favoritism to a select elite._line_Ignoring the foundations of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s economic past, the PiS has also signaled a desire to wind down privatization activity. While previous administrations declared objectives to whittle down the number of state-controlled companies to 250, the PiS party will likely leave state-ownership at the existing 1000 small, medium, and large enterprises._line_Aiming to reduce reliance on foreign companies, the party has also levied additional taxes on large foreign-owned retail and banking. Consequently, fixed capital formation shrunk by as much as 7.2% in the third quarter of 2016 as Poland experienced a material drop in foreign direct investment. The material lapse in GDP growth in late 2016 and early 2017 can be directly attributed to the deterioration of Poland as a hotbed for FDI and privatization, the very policies that led to its economic prominence post communism._line_Geopolitical Concerns: Mitigant_line_A recovery in geopolitical stability in the latter half of 2017 has restored confidence in Poland\xe2\x80\x99s economic engine. In October of 2017, the Sejm resoundingly voted 352-58 to cast down legislation that would have constrained legal abortion to cases where the mother\xe2\x80\x99s life was threatened. President Duda defied Prime Minister Kaczy\xc5\x84ski and vetoed the bills which would have reshuffled the supreme court and dissolved the National Council. The bill allocating the power to appoint heads of local court remains, with President Duda citing a goal of removing judges which have been unaccountable and slow to render judgements._line_Simultaneously, investment rebounded by 3-4% in the first quarter, as revivified confidence also buoyed private consumption by 1.6%. Although public relations continue to remain strained, the marked inflow of EU funds back into public investment projects and infrastructure revised GDP growth upward to a healthy 3.4%. Meanwhile, changes Poland introduced in 2015 and 2016 aimed at improving bankruptcy and restructuring frameworks, deregulating over 70 barriers to foreign business operation, and cutting the number of hours necessary to report taxes kicked in to mitigate remaining inefficiencies of state-owned operators._line_Building off of the momentum Poland has established in the first quarter of 2017 will prove crucial in restoring economic sentiment. The PiS government\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgement of the economic rationale behind Poland\xe2\x80\x99s shock therapy, namely privatization and FDI, will ultimately define the future as well as the past._line_Demographic Themes: Risk_line_Poland\xe2\x80\x99s population of 38 million has not proven immune to an aging demographic currently plaguing a variety of developed countries. As in most transition economies shedding a communist government, Poland experienced a rapid drop in birth rates in the early 1990s. Further aggravating the shrinking labor force, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s accession into the European Union in 2004 opened the doors to substantial emigration to Ireland and the UK._line_While the Civic Platform responded by increasing the pension age and lowering pension payments, the PiS party has reversed on sensical labor reforms. In December of 2016, legislation was adopted to reduce the retirement age from 67 to 65 for men and 60 for women. Furthermore, the PiS party has reneged on its agreement with the EU to absorb 6,200 Muslim refugees from Greece and Italy. Poland also records one of the lowest labor participation rates in the OECD. The lower labor supply artificially decreases Poland\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment rate and has obscured structural deficiencies._line_Poland\xe2\x80\x99s ethnically homogenous population and the PiS\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of Roman Catholic patriotism naturally resist the relocation package signed with the EU in 2015. Brussels has since launched infringement proceedings, further weakening bilateral relations between the two countries._line_Demographic Themes: Mitigant_line_While an aging population continues to hamper labor supply, half of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s population falls below the age of 35. Consequently, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s labor force is actually younger than the majority of EU nations. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Poland has pioneered improvements on hits young labor force through emphasis on education. The average number of years of schooling stands at 11.8, one of the highest in the world. While corporate R&D is reliant on foreign innovation, 500 academic centers across the country foster a vibrant scholarly community._line_By emerging as the dominant European center of modern Business Process Offshoring services, Poland finds employment for millions of young poles in service sectors from banking to retail. While exports continue to be dominated by automobile manufacturing and chemical processing, the services sector still contributes about 64% of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s GDP. Wage bargaining in the service sector especially remains largely decentralized, with agreements over collective pay and conditions covering only 5% of employees in small companies._line_Moreover, though Poland has remained defiant against accepting Middle Eastern refugees, the country has absorbed over 1 million migrants from Ukraine and the East in 2016 alone. Given a labor shortage of 75,000 employees in the retail sector, the influx of foreign workers is crucial in avoiding the need to excessively raise wages to attract laborers. Compared to the designated 6,200 refused refugees highlighted by media, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of eastern migrants has flown under the radar._line_Overall, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s young, educated populace remains resilient to the structural difficulties hindering growth in developed markets. While recent PiS actions undermine the advantage Poland has maintained in Eastern Europe, continued emigration from Baltic States and a receding brain drain will sustain current labor force advantages. Recent resistance to the Posting of Workers Directive aimed at preventing companies from hiring workers in poorer European states by posting them for temporary work in Western areas will stem the flow of labor away from Poland._line_Manufacturing and Industry_line_Even in the midst of one of the most enduring economic expansions in recent history, Poland has been reprimanded for lackluster infrastructure spending and inefficient tax regulation._line_Infrastructure Risk: Ranking a mediocre 53rd (out of 138 countries) in the World Economic Forum\xe2\x80\x99s Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, Poland physical capital lags many of its Western EU peers. Poor reviews are substantiated by the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Logistics Performance Index (LPI). The LPI cites outdated road infrastructure and railway connections as Poland\xe2\x80\x99s most immediate impediment to labor and capital mobility. Poland is currently ranked 72nd for the quality of its roads, with international companies often suffering long distances to airports, rail stations, and ports._line_Mitigant: Despite its shortcomings, the PiS party recognizes the obstacles to further stimulating trade. The PLN 6.5 billion Polskie Inwestycje Rozwojowe (PIR) fund aimed at modernizing Polish infrastructure is now fully funded. Maria Wasiak, the Minister of Infrastructure and Development, has further pledged PLN 5 billion for road and railway development by 2023._line_Meanwhile, restored foreign direct investment into public projects in Poland will continue to spur productivity improvements. Thomas White estimates that EU funds instrumental in developing Poland\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure propelled nearly 100% growth in GDP per capita in the last decade, and will continue to renovate rural areas. Since 2004, EU accession has severely limited trade restrictions to Poland from member countries. The World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s Doing Business 2017 survey ranked Poland 1st in the trading across borders sub-category even despite infrastructure inhibitions._line_With latest official statistics showing that Poland has successfully reduced its fiscal deficit by 10% to PLN 900m, the combination of strategic fiscal policy and foreign equity injections create an opportune environment for developing infrastructure._line_Tax Risk: Meanwhile, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s corporate tax regime is a sizable regulatory burden. For instance, companies spend an average of 271 hours per year declaring taxes, required to service 7 different payments before tax completion. Despite Poland\xe2\x80\x99s low corporate tax rate of 14.5%, the country was ranked 47th out of 190 countries in the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s Doing Business 2017 report in tax matters._line_Mitigant: Despite historical inaction against tax complications, a crucial component of recent fiscal discipline has been a crackdown on tax avoidance by tax authorities. Strengthened IT systems and an improved tax administrative system have improved budget deficit projections by 30% to 0.7% of GDP for 2017. While the domestic tax system consumes an abhorrent amount of company resources, it takes just one hour to comply with Polish import regulations. Comparatively, the OECD averages 13 hours to deal with import customs._line_Inherent Advantages_line_Despite concentration on Poland\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical machinations, the country has championed a half-trillion-dollar economy that is now the world\xe2\x80\x99s 24th largest. Poland\xe2\x80\x99s exports account for 33 percent of GDP, 50% above the emerging market average of 22 percent.With wages at one-third of those in Germany, Poland has cultivated a manufacturing engine that rivals the Asian tiger economies of the 1990s._line_Poland\xe2\x80\x99s geographical location in the center of Europe has expedited its robust economic growth. Poland has been targeted by imperialistic powers as recently as WWII for its prevalence as the link between Eastern and Western Europe, connected with cities like London, Paris, Vienna, and Berlin. Poland\xe2\x80\x99s large fertile area in Lower Silesia, the Little Poland Lowlands, the Kujawy, the Vistula delta, and the Lublin area have forged the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading producer in rye, sugar beets, and wheat. Meanwhile, natural endowments in bituminous coal, sulfur, barite, and salt have crafted a mining sector active since the 13th century._line_While other emerging nations are reliant on exporting raw materials like oil or soybeans, Poland has avoided the inherent volatility in commodity-oriented economies. Out of the 13 middle-income countries with average incomes of $10,000 to $15,000, Poland is among the 4 not dependent on materials such as oil and coal (which define Brazil, Russia, and Argentina). While 90 percent of leading oil exporters no richer relative to the US than they were two decades ago, Poland has gradually been eroding its development gap._line_Most importantly, Poland has achieved continued economic exceptionalism without overindulgence in credit markets. While China has run up debts to nearly 300 percent of GDP, Poland\xe2\x80\x99s credit exposure has remained stable since 2013. Again, Poland was the only European Union member to escape recession. As Poland had not yet joined the euro in 2008, the zloty\xe2\x80\x99s ability to strongly depreciate against the euro bolstered exports, while Poland\xe2\x80\x99s minimal fiscal deficit avoided rapidly augmenting debt payments. The Heritage Foundation cites Poland\xe2\x80\x99s flexible exchange rate, central bank with an IMF credit line, and economic ties with Germany as the reasoning behind its escape from recession._line_Investment in Poland_line_In 2016, retail investors closed 22,000 unused client accounts and continuously drew money out of Polish equities. Nevertheless, Poland has seen a resurgence in 2017, as continued economic resilience has finally begun to register on investment radars. The most popular Polish investment options include the iShares MSCI Poland Capped ETF EPOL and the VanEck Vectors Poland ETF PLND. PLND is the older of the two Poland ETFs, and has appreciated 11.5% over the MSCI Emerging Markets Index this year. U.S. investors' enthusiasm for EPOL has also become evident, as the the ETF added $27.4 million in new assets, an additional 10% over its $260.3 million in assets under management._line_While the U.S. stock market has reached frothy valuations and the Western European stock market has exceeded pre-crisis highs, the Polish market is still 20% below its previous peak. Again, Poland was the only EU nation to avoid a recession, and has averaged growth nearly double that of the U.S. economy. The best opportunities in Poland lay in the energy sector, where replacement of outdated energy plants and exploration of shale gas reserves create appealing investment options. Continued PiS favoritism of national Polish banks and retail options serve to solidify the attractiveness of the domestic financial sector. Finally, concerns over Brexit, Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt gradually mitigated debt crisis, and a cooled China have yet to materialize into a slowdown in the Polish economy; if anything, such developments have obscured the charm of the Eastern Europe region and nurtured a value investment opportunity._line_The Market Vectors Poland ETF (PLND) currently presents an enticing pure-play Polish investment. With a forecasted PE Ratio of 12.84 due to healthy earnings growth of 8%, the ETF offers a risk-tolerant, value-add investment with low correlation to the S&P 500. The ETF\xe2\x80\x99s concentration in key sectors including Financials (41%), Energy (16%), and Basic Materials (11%) target the most opportunistic components of the Polish market. Finally, a minimal expense ratio of 0.60% reduces risk of flowing returns to fund managers rather than fund owners. Given a dividend yield of 1.49% and an earnings growth rate of approximately 8%, investors can anticipate a 9.50% return before accounting for expansion in multiples. As a result, a conservative price target of $21.40 is expected for FY 2018, with a bullish price target of $22.90 (17.2% return) when accounting for increases in PE ratios to MSCI averages of 15.54._line_Despite present political concerns, Poland remains one of the most overlooked, expansion-oriented value investments in the entire European region. Polish expatriates have returned to their country given rising economic opportunity, reducing the brain drain and inducing greater nationalism. No longer is the Polish plumber the poster child of emigration away from the nation. The Pole has returned to Poland, and soon foreign investors will flood in as well: the golden knob to the door is PLND._line_Disclosure: I am/we are long PLND._line_I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article._line_"

S'Vivo is set to launch two new smartphones Vivo V7 and Vivo V7+ on 7th September 2017 at an event in Mumbai India. These two devices are expected to be selfie focussed smartphones as Vivo V5 and Vivo V5+ are. If you remember, Vivo V5 and Vivo V5+ comes with 20 MP front selfie cameras with the plus variant having a dual camera at the front (20 MP + 8 MP). Vivo V7 and Vivo V7+ are expected to offer improved front selfie cameras and a new poster leaked suggests that both these device will feature a 24 MP front selfie camera. Out of these two, the plus variant is expect to feature 24 MP dual front camera. We are not sure about the secondary sensor at the moment._line_The leaked poster below clearly mentions that both V7 and V7+ will feature a \xe2\x80\x9c24MP Clearer Selfie\xe2\x80\x9d camera. The poster also confirms the infinity display with 18:9 aspect ratio, similar to what we have seen in Galaxy S8 / S8+ and Note8. Apart from the camera details, we do not have more details about Vivo V7 / V7+ hardware specifications._line_Coming to the existing Vivo V5 Plus, it features a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p display, powered by octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage running Funtouch OS 3.0 (based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system)._line_As wih any other leak, take this with a pinch of salt.

S'Doctors: \'Trick question\' hurt sick kids_line_ (CNN)Two Democratic members of Florida\'s congressional delegation have asked the federal government to step in and help after the state\'s removal of thousands of children from a Florida Medicaid program._line_"We have seen over the years that the State of Florida has evaded its legal responsibilities in many instances to ensure access to care for the children of Florida," Sen. Bill Nelson and Rep. Kathy Castor wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Tuesday._line_The letter comes in the wake of a CNN story detailing how Florida\'s Republican administration took 13,074 children off a Medicaid insurance plan called Children\'s Medical Services and put them on privately managed Medicaid plans in 2015._line_For more than 40 years, Children\'s Medical Services, or CMS, has specialized in caring for Florida children on Medicaid with special medical needs. The children who were removed and put on other Medicaid plans had health problems such as birth defects, heart disease, diabetes and blindness. Their new plans did not specialize in caring for children with these types of medical conditions._line_Castor told CNN on Wednesday that the state of Florida "clearly" did something wrong when it moved the children from CMS to the privately managed Medicaid plans._line_"Florida had one of the highest-quality and most efficient treatment and care programs for children with special health care needs," she said. "They\'ve obliterated that."_line_"We urge HHS to exercise its oversight and enforcement authority to ensure that children in Florida are appropriately enrolled in the plan that best fits their needs," Nelson and Castor wrote in their letter._line_Mara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said Tuesday that the department is "100 percent focused on making sure the programs we manage are providing quality care -- especially to children."_line_"Any assertion that children have been denied care or are not receiving services is absolutely false," she added._line_In September 2015, a state administrative law judge ruled that the Department of Health had unlawfully removed the children from CMS and ordered it to stop._line_The state stopped using the screening method in question, but it wasn\'t until last month that the department wrote letters to families letting them know their children could be rescreened to be put back on CMS._line_The lawmakers questioned why the letters went to only 6,081 parents when more than 13,000 children were kicked out of CMS._line_"It remains unclear why the state chose to contact only half of the families affected, what criteria the state used in making the determination of which families to contact, and how many children are actually reenrolled after being revaluated," Nelson and Castor wrote._line_"It\'s unconscionable. There is no reasonable explanation for the state of Florida to be dragging their feet on this," Castor said._line_"The state of Florida and DOH have not followed through with their responsibilities as directed by the courts," she said. "They\'ve left these children in the lurch. They\'ve said they\'re going to take care of it, and they\'ve utterly failed to do that."_line_Gambineri said in early August that the letters went to parents of children who were removed from CMS and put on another Medicaid plan and were still on that plan and financially eligible for Medicaid._line_Join the conversation_line_See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter._line_Dr. Louis St. Petery, former executive vice president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he doesn\'t trust the state to reach out to all of the affected families._line_He pointed out that the state didn\'t reach out to the families soon after the judge\'s decision, even though he urged officials to do so._line_"There\'s been a lack of transparency all the way through, which CNN tracked down," he said. "I always felt that for the Department of Health, the end justified the means, and the end was to get these kids off of CMS."_line_St. Petery and some other pediatricians think the state switched the children to Medicaid plans run by private insurance companies because most of those companies have been generous donors to Florida Republican Party committees. _line_A statement by the Department of Health called this allegation "100 percent false." _line_'

S' (CNN)The tiny Southeast Asian sultanate of Brunei is better known as an exporter of oil and gas than of fashion._line_But a royal collaboration has thrust the nation into the sartorial spotlight. _line_In April, Princess Sarah of Brunei -- the wife of Crown Prince of Brunei, Al-Muhtadee Billah, who is first in line to inherit the throne -- partnered with Malaysian brand dUCk scarves and online retailer Fashion Valet, to launch The Royal dUCk Collection._line_Bright and colorful, the limited-edition scarves, sold to be worn as hijabs, celebrate female collaboration and empowerment._line_"Muslim women are supposed to wear scarves. For me, it was always a forced thing. (Scarves are) something my mom\'s generation never questioned but I think now, our generation is different," Malaysian entrepreneur Vivy Yusof, 29, tells CNN of the way the royal line is updating a traditional form of dress with modern values. _line_The elevator pitch_line_A Malaysian fashion influencer with her own reality TV show and more than one million Instagram followers, Yusof is no stranger to celebrity. _line_In 2010, she co-founded e-commerce site Fashion Valet with her husband, Fadzarudin Anuar, to help Malaysians discover independent local designers._line_The site boomed. Today it has 150 employees, sells 400 southeast Asian brands, and receives 1,000 orders a day on average._line_Yusof distinguished Fashion Valet from competitors by focusing on local brands and commissioning designers to create pieces exclusively for the site._line_Then in 2015, she founded her own line, dUCk, which specializes in colorful, high-end scarves aimed at urban women._line_The chance to collaborate with royalty came when Princess Sarah attended a Fashion Valet pop-up event in Brunei\'s northeastern Muara district in June 2016._line_"The hotel staff told us: \'Princess Sarah is going to come.\' So we were very nervous," recalls Yusof. "Do we put out a red carpet? But she was just a normal human being shopping with her daughter."_line_After the event, Yusof accompanied Princess Sarah to the parking lot, and impulsively asked her to collaborate on a line of headscarves._line_"The worst she can do is say no," Yusof remembers thinking. "She just smiled and didn\'t say much. It was really crazy. I never thought that was actually going to happen."_line_A few days later, Princess Sarah\'s sister-in-law, Noorsurainah Tengah, called up. _line_The princess was in. _line_While Yusof and Princess Sarah brainstormed design concepts, colors and fabrics, Tengah took care of the administrative details._line_Available in four colors, the scarf retails for $140._line_"It turned into something that was more than a product ... it symbolized something for all womanhood," says Tengah._line_Ready to launch_line_In April, the Royal dUCk Scarf line officially launched at Brunei\'s beachfront The Empire Hotel and Resort, where the princess gave an emotional speech._line_"It was a really honest speech. It meant something and these women could relate to it," says Tengah. _line_Princess Sarah, according to The Star Malaysia, framed the venture as a dialogue between two women._line_"At the risk of underwhelming everyone, it honestly was just one woman to another being able to make a connection, each being able to relate to the other, being inspired and wanting to build more on each other\'s perspectives and seeing where she would take us," she reportedly said. _line_That ethos seemingly touched a nerve with female consumers._line_"On the first day of the three-day pre-order period leading up to the launch, the (Fashion Valet) site crashed," says Yusof. "People were so excited because it\'s not normal in Brunei for a princess to collaborate with a fashion brand." _line_Who is Princess Sarah?_line_Pengiran Anak Isteri Pengiran Anak Sarah -- aka Princess Sarah, now aged 30 -- was born in Brunei to a scientist father, distantly related to the country\'s royal family, and a Swiss nurse mother._line_In 2004, when she married into the royal family aged 17, it was the dubbed the "wedding of the year" in Asia, with heads of state from all over the world in attendance, including Singapore\'s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and the then Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. _line_ Her Royal Highness Princess Sarah and Vivy Yusof -- the two beautiful and inspiring women behind the collaboration, and the true embodiments of all the attributes this dUCk represents. Don\'t you agree? :) - D. #duckscarves #scarves #hijab #theroyalduck @srdesign.brunei_line_A post shared by The dUCk Group (@theduckgroup) on Apr 7, 2017 at 5:04am PDT_line_After marriage, the princess continued her education, reportedly graduating from university in Brunei with a bachelor\'s degree in public policy, and serving as a cadet in the military. _line_"She is a person of high stature but she is relatable," says Tengah. "I think that\'s the general perception of her: that she\'s down to earth." _line_Yusof agrees._line_"What really shocked me about (Princess Sarah) is that she drives herself everywhere in Brunei. She doesn\'t like to have a driver," she tells CNN. "She picks up her kids from school and attends their events herself -- I thought it was crazy."_line_Brunei\'s royal rulers_line_Brunei\'s royal family has ruled for more than 600 years making it one of the world\'s longest-running monarchies._line_The 200,000-square-meter Istana Nurul Iman royal palace holds the Guinness World Record for the "world\'s largest living residence of a state head."_line_The palace features 1,788 rooms, more than 250 bathrooms, a helipad, and five pools._line_The second-wealthiest ruler in the world, Sultan Haji Hassanal is said to be worth $20 billion. _line_His extensive car collection is rumored to include more than 500 Rolls-Royces. _line_The princess\' relative transparency stands in contrast to other members of the royal family._line_While Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah is known to keep a tight lid on family affairs, his status as one of the world\'s wealthiest rulers, with a reported $20 billion as of 2011, is hardly a secret._line_Furthermore, Princess Sarah is operating in a country that in 2014 made international headlines when it introduced sharia law. _line_The Islamic penal code punishes crimes such as sodomy with flogging and death by stoning, and its introduction was widely condemned by women\'s activists around the world._line_Fashin entrepreneur Vivy Yusof._line_A fashion frontier_line_In Brunei, social media, independent designers and bloggers -- such as Fadzil and Ajeeratul Abdullah, of Jeera Does Fashion -- are driving the country\'s fashion scene. _line_"These younger generations are very expressive," says Tengah, who works for a sovereign wealth fund and was recently named a 40 Under 40 achiever by Chief Investment Officer magazine. _line_While outsiders might assume sharia law would limit fashion, Abdullah says that\'s not the case._line_"Sharia law in Brunei only touches on criminal offenses (and doesn\'t affect fashion). Wearing a hijab is not compulsory, however, in the workplace, you are expected, but not obligated, to wear a headscarf if you are Muslim," Abdullah tells CNN. _line_"Although there is an expectation of decency in line with our Islamic views, you can wear whatever you want."_line_Yusof agrees that fashion holds significance, especially in southeast Asia where dress and religion often go hand in hand._line_"I delayed wearing a headscarf for a long time," says Yusof. "My mom is very conservative and kept asking me to cover up. _line_"But I didn\'t think it was cool or international or urban, to wear a scarf. That\'s why I wanted to give women a more fashionable option." _line_Mission accomplished._line_'

S'AR Rahman said that the love he has received from people across the globe motivates him to work hard and experiment with his music. _line_Singer AR Rahman_line_AR Rahman said that the love he has received from people across the globe motivates him to work hard and experiment with his music. The Academy Award-winning musician said that he never expected to receive so much affection from the people and wants to reciprocate the same through his music. _line_In an interview with PTI, Rahman said, "People have been so good to me... I feel I should give more. And this thought makes me work harder, as not everybody gets the opportunity to connect. _line_"I get to meet people, interact with them, so I want to use that to do greater things. It is about embracing love and being unconditional to everyone," he said. _line_Rahman said from musicians and singers working with him, to the people, who like his work, everyone inspires him. "As a musician you always want to grow further... In this journey, everyone inspires you - a singer, a musician and people\'s love too inspire you. I am enjoying every bit of this. It is not about money all the time for me," he said. _line_The 50-year-old composer is currently busy with his upcoming movie "One Heart: The AR Rahman Concert Film". The film focuses on the backstage stories of his concerts. _line_"It\'s not a documentary film as such. It has performance, songs. The idea came (to me) in 2016... Sometimes you do shows and you feel you want to document them. I felt the urge to do that,\'\' he said.  _line_"I asked my show director and he documented it. After six months to one year, a producer came on board and said why not make it into a film? Once we finished it, we re-shot certain portions as I hate watching myself, so I wanted to reshoot it and make it precise," he said. _line_Nasreen Munni Kabir, who has penned a book on Rahman, has worked on the story of the film. The proceeds from the movie will go to Rahman\'s One Heart foundation to help old musicians and their families. _line_"Whatever the film earns will go to the foundation that is run by GIMA (Global Indian Music Academy). It is for musicians, the older generation who are suffering, they don\'t have medical assistance and if there children want to study they can\'t due to financial reasons.\'\' he said. _line_"I feel this is the apt way to help musicians who have given their life, passion and soul for music, and give respect to the work done by them," he said. _line_"One Heart: The AR Rahman Concert Film" is slated to release on September 7. _line_'

S' Washington, Aug 5 (IBNS): What is our universe made of, and has its composition changed over time?_line_ Scientists have new insights about these fundamental questions, thanks to an international collaboration of more than 400 scientists called the Dark Energy Survey (DES)._line_ Three scientists from NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are part of this group that is helping to further our understanding of the structure of the universe._line_ The advances in astrophysics from DES are crucial to preparations for two upcoming space missions that will probe similar questions about the nature of the universe: ESA\'s Euclid mission (which has significant NASA participation) and NASA\'s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope mission, both expected to launch in the 2020s._line_ "With this study, we are showcasing what\'s going to be possible with these much more complex observatories," said Andres Plazas Malagon, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL, who helped characterize DES\'s Dark Energy Camera detectors and who is also involved in detector studies for WFIRST._line_ Leading models of the universe suggest it is mostly composed of entities we cannot see: dark matter and dark energy._line_ Dark matter acts like invisible glue, holding galaxies and galaxy clusters together gravitationally, while dark energy is thought to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe._line_ Some of our best predictions for how much dark matter and dark energy are in the universe come from the European Space Agency\'s Planck satellite, which looks at the light from about 400,000 years after the Big Bang._line_ Now, the Dark Energy Survey has examined the composition of the recent universe. Remarkably, the new results are close to forecasts made from Planck measurements of the distant past, allowing scientists to understand more about how the universe has evolved over approximately 14 billion years._line_ The findings were revealed in a presentation at the American Physical Society Division of Particles and Fields meeting at the U.S. Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois._line_ "The Planck results have been the landmark constraints in cosmology. It is truly amazing that you have a model that describes the universe at 400,000 years old, and now we have a similarly precise measurement of the universe at 13 billion years [old] that agrees with the model," said JPL\'s Tim Eifler, who led the Dark Energy Survey analysis team that developed the science software for the interpretation of the results._line_ Scientists find that about 70 percent of the energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. About 25 percent is composed of the mysterious dark matter, with normal matter making up the remainder. All of this agrees with precise measurements made to date. So far, DES has found no evidence that the amount of dark energy has changed over time -- a finding that is consistent with Albert Einstein\'s idea of a "cosmological constant."_line_ The results are especially important to the scientific community because they mark the first time that observations from the more recent universe -- the "adult" universe -- by a technique called gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, have yielded results as precise as those from the cosmic microwave background radiation -- light from the "infant" universe._line_ "This is the crossover point where gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering measurements and surveys will be the primary driver of what we know about dark energy in the universe," said Eric Huff, a JPL researcher who invented a new method of extracting the weak lensing signal, enhancing the precision of the DES galaxy shape catalogs._line_ The results come from the first-year data set of the Dark Energy Survey, which uses a 570-megapixel camera mounted on the 4-meter Blanco telescope at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory\xe2\x80\x99s Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Its data are processed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign._line_ To measure dark matter, scientists first created maps of galaxy positions. Then, they precisely measured the shapes of 26 million galaxies to directly map patterns of dark matter over billions of light years, using gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering._line_ The DES team developed new ways to detect the tiny lensing distortions of galaxy images. In the process, they created the largest guide to spotting dark matter in the cosmos ever drawn. The new dark matter map is 10 times the size of the one DES released in 2015 and continues to grow._line_ The DES collaboration will publish on a data set five times larger over the next two years._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a feeling of true discovery in the collaboration. For the first time, we have the data and tools in hand to see whether Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s cosmological constant prevails. We are all excited to explore the physical nature of dark energy," Eifler said. "In particular we want to see if there are hints in the data that suggest modifying the laws of gravity on the largest scales in the universe."_line_ Image Credits: Chihway Chang/Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago/DES Collaboration_line_'

S" PATNA: In its centenary year, Patna University (PU) has decided to get itself accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) at the earliest. A 29-member committee, headed by vice-chancellor (VC) Ras Bihari Prasad Singh and having pro-VC Dolly Sinha as its coordinator, has been constituted to expedite the process. _line_  According to a PU notification issued on Wednesday, the first meeting of the preparatory committee will be held on September 7 for a detailed discussion on different parameters of assessment and accreditation. After completing necessary groundwork, PU will submit its LoI (letter of intent) to the NAAC. The university will also have to post a copy of self study report (SSR) on the NAAC's website and send hard copies of SSR to the council by post subsequently. _line_ The initiative to get the university accredited was taken by the authorities recently when they faced some difficulties in mobilizing resources for carrying out development activities. Almost all the funding agencies, including UGC (through Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyan or RUSA) and DST, are doling out grants to only those universities which are NAAC accredited. Even the state council on higher education has already warned the universities and colleges that they would remain deprived of all the development grants if they are not accredited soon. _line_ It may be mentioned here that PU had initiated a similar drive for accreditation more than a couple of years back and had even submitted its LoI to the NAAC, but nothing materialized. For some reasons beyond control, PU could not submit SSR on time. However, this time, the varsity is very particular to complete all the necessary formalities well in time and volunteer itself for accreditation. _line_ Only five universities in the state \xe2\x80\x94 Chanakya National Law University (CNLU), L N Mithila University (LNMU), Magadh University (MU), Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU) and Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (KSDSU) \xe2\x80\x94 have been accredited by the NAAC so far. While CNLU has got grade A, MU has been accredited with grade C. Besides, 57 colleges, out of more than 260 constituent colleges, have so far been accredited, eight of which have been awarded grade A. The rest have been accredited with grades B or C. As many as five colleges have been accorded CPE (college with potential for excellence) status by the UGC. They include Patna Women's College, Magadh Mahila College and A N College in Patna, Gaya College in Gaya and Mahant Darshan Das Mahila College in Muzaffarpur. _line_"

S'Birgunj : Nepalese men carry children on their shoulders as they wade through flood waters in village Ramgadhwa in Birgunj, Nepal, Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017. An official said torrential rain, landslides and flooding have killed dozens of people in Nepal_line_ Devastating floods in Nepal have sparked regional tension, with Nepali politicians and media outlets claiming that Indian infrastructure along their shared border has left Nepal vulnerable._line_ In a visit last week to India, Nepal\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba released a joint statement with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi pledging to work together to combat future flood disasters. But relations between the two countries remain strained, and many in Nepal still resent India for a three-month blockade of supplies in the wake of the 2015 earthquakes._line_ One source of this tension is simply the geography of the Himalayas, where a dam or road built in one country can cause inundation in its neighbour._line_ The result is an international blame game, with India, China and Nepal accusing each other of shortsighted and self-interested politics. Without region-wide organisations to effectively share information and coordinate disaster relief, many more people have suffered._line_ Tangled geography_line_ Floods are almost annual events in the Himalayas. Huge rivers originating in the Himalayas pass through the densely settled Terai flats that span both India and Nepal, and these rivers swell enormously in the monsoon season._line_A rough outline of the Himalayas._line_ But this year\xe2\x80\x99s floods have been particularly devastating. In the past two months more than 1,200 people have been killed and 20 million others affected by floods in Nepal, India and Bangladesh._line_ These trans-border floods are a political as well as a logistical problem. In the case of the recent floods, Nepal\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Home Affairs pointed to two large Indian dams in the Kosi and Gandaki rivers, as well as high roads, embankments and dykes built parallel to Nepal\xe2\x80\x99s 1,751km border with India, arguing that this infrastructure obstructs the natural flow of water._line_ India, for its part, has blamed Nepal for creating floods in the past and \xe2\x80\x93 although disputed in scientific circles \xe2\x80\x93 many believe deforestation in Nepal contributes to water overflow into India._line_ The problem is that infrastructure in one country can have a serious impact on its neighbours, especially in monsoon season. At least a dozen people were injured last year in clashes over an Indian dam that the Kathmandu Post reported will inundate parts of Nepal when completed._line_ And the problems aren\xe2\x80\x99t just caused by dams. Hydrologists and disaster experts in Nepal claim that recent floods have been worsened by significant illegal mining of the low Churia hills for boulders and sand, for use in the rapidly expanding construction sector in India._line_ India, China and Nepal_line_ The disputes aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited to India and Nepal. India and China signed a deal in 2006 to share hydrological information on the huge rivers that run through both their territories, so as to cope better with annual flooding. But earlier this year India\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of External Affairs accused China of failing to share vital data, exacerbating floods in India\xe2\x80\x99s northeast._line_ This is not an isolated incident. In 2013 a huge flood in northwestern India, called the Himalayan tsunami, killed around 6,000 people and affected millions more._line_ At that time, India officials claimed that they did not get information from Nepalese officials on heavy rainfall in Nepal\xe2\x80\x99s hills, or on glacier conditions. Nepali officials, in turn, responded that China is in a better position to share information about climatic conditions on that part of the Himalayas. Studies conducted later concluded that efficient information sharing and early warnings would have reduced the resulting damage._line_ This problem becomes more urgent as the Himalayas come under pressure from climate change. Climate scientists have warned that \xe2\x80\x9cextreme floods\xe2\x80\x9d in the region are becoming more frequent, driven by less frequent but more intense rainfall._line_ It is now vital to think differently about how institutions handle these disasters. India and Nepal announced last week that they would establish a Joint Committee on Inundation and Flood Management, and a Joint Team of Experts to \xe2\x80\x9cenhance bilateral co-operation\xe2\x80\x9d in water management, which is a positive sign._line_ But the Himalayas urgently needs institutions with a region-wide perspective, rather that country-specific remits. These organisations can effeciently share information on weather patterns, take action to reduce overall impact of floods, and consult each other while developing infrastructures that could have trans-boundary consequences._line_ Human interference and myopic political action have intensified the impact of these floods. We now need every country in the region to accept shared responsibility and commit to helping those affected, regardless of their nationality._line_'

S'Under the new tax regime, which came into effect on 1 July 2017, the cascading effect of taxes on taxes has been reduced. So, what does it mean for car buyers? Will they have to pay more? What about second-hand vehicles; will GST come in to play here too? Does the new tax structure have any influence on car insurance, or EMIs? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out._line_Overview of the automobile sector Post GST_line_ The GST rollout has moved manufacturers to revise prices of new vehicles \xe2\x80\x93 mostly downward \xe2\x80\x93 as per the new tax structure, spelling good news for car buyers. Here are some changes:_line_ - The present system clubs together several taxes that used to be applicable before such as excise, VAT, sales tax, road tax, motor vehicle tax, registration duty on cars and bikes etc._line_ - While the tax incidence on cars earlier ranged in the 28% to 55% bracket, the basic GST rate for the automobile industry has now been set at 28%_line_ - Additionally, the government has proposed to levy a cess on vehicles of different segments and sizes._line_ There is still some ambiguity in pricing and taxes as incentives and exemptions differ from state to state. Eventually, the end prices of vehicles will vary accordingly._line_ The GST proposal seems largely beneficial; small cars will not see much of a difference, but luxury cars and SUVs will become more affordable. The case, however, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same for hybrid cars._line_Hybrid cars_line_ These will attract a higher tax burden, as they have been designated luxury cars and will now attract 43% GST (28% plus a cess of 15%). The same bifurcation of rate applies to large luxury cars and SUVs. The tax spike will affect the hybrid segment, especially in places where such vehicles earlier enjoyed lower VAT rates and excise duties._line_ The tax rate on electric vehicles is fixed at 12%._line_Impact for used car buyers_line_ On the flip side, it is feared that second-hand car buyers will likely suffer. Contrary to market expectations over the past few months, most dealerships may pass on this tax burden to customers, which means that a potential second-hand car buyer would now pay substantially higher costs._line_Used Car Business_line_ Dealers of second-hand cars must now pay GST only on their margin, and can avail input tax credits. However, in the short term, this extra tax poses a huge cost burden on them._line_ Additionally, they cannot afford to hike prices, as doing so would run the risk of competing directly with new cars, which are now going to cost less. The only possible solution for car dealers is to buy these pre-owned cars at lower prices than the going rates during pre-GST days._line_ This means that a second-hand car dealer, who was expecting to get Rs. 3 lakhs for a car before July, is likely to be offered a lower rate now._line_ In the long run, however, they can reduce their losses by passing on the tax credit to customers._line_Car Insurance_line_ The GST Council announced an 18% tax rate on the insurance sector, implying a hike of about 3% over the existing 15%. As this will be directly passed on to customers, it will, in tandem, have a direct impact on the premiums of various insurance policies._line_Car insurance policies come in two formats:_line_ (a) Comprehensive Motor Insurance: Covers third-party liability and damage caused to the vehicle._line_ (b) Third-Party Motor Insurance: Cover against third-party liability that arises only due to property damage and/or physical injury caused to the third party involving the insured\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle._line_ The new rate of 18% will be applied on the entire premium amount._line_ Brief on price cuts for different brands_line_Maruti Suzuki_line_ Post July 1, India\xe2\x80\x99s largest automaker by units sold and revenues earned, Maruti Suzuki India, slashed selling prices of most models by up to 3%, setting the benchmark for the market._line_ Alto will be cheaper by around Rs 2,000-Rs 5,000, while the Wagon R will cost less by about Rs 5,000-Rs 8,300, and the Swift by Rs 6,700-Rs 10,700._line_ The Baleno is seeing lower prices by around Rs 6,600-Rs 13,100, while the Swift Dzire, India\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling sedan right now, has seen a price cut of Rs 8,100-Rs 15,100._line_ Other cars enjoying substantial price cuts include Vitara Brezza, (down by Rs 10,400-Rs 14,700) and S-Coss (down Rs 17,700-Rs 21,300). Ertiga Petrol prices reduced by Rs 21,800 and Ciaz petrol by Rs 23,400._line_ However, the cost of Ciaz and Ertiga hybrid models spiralled after tax concessions were withdrawn under GST. For instance, the diesel variants have increased by as much as Rs. 1 lakh._line_Hyundai_line_ Prices of small cars from Hyundai \xe2\x80\x93 which include the Eon, Grand i10, Elite i20, Xcent and i20 Active - also slashed costs by around Rs 8,000-Rs 24,000._line_ Verna and Elantra \xe2\x80\x93 Hyundi\xe2\x80\x99s sedans \xe2\x80\x93 witnessed larger reductions of around Rs 27,000-Rs 70,000, while its SUVs \xe2\x80\x93Creta, Tucson and Santa Fe \xe2\x80\x93 went down by around Rs 1 to Rs 2.5 lakhs._line_Tata Motors_line_ The company\xe2\x80\x99s small car section, including Nano, Tiago, Zest, Indica, Bolt, Tigor and Indigo, saw a drop between Rs 5,000 and Rs 21,000._line_ A much bigger drop in prices were given to the Sumo, Safari and Hexa of around Rs 80,000-Rs 1.60 lakhs._line_Honda Cars India_line_ Honda cut prices of its WR-V, Amaze, Jazz and Brio by up to Rs 24,000, the City by Rs 31,000 and CR-V by up to Rs 2.3 lakhs._line_Toyota_line_ Prices for Toyota\xe2\x80\x99s Etios and Corolla decreased by Rs 57,000, while that of the Fortuner and Land Cruiser by a whopping Rs 3 to Rs 10.5 lakhs._line_Mahindra and Mahindra_line_ Meanwhile, the Mahindra group has reduced the cost of the KUV100, TUV300 and Verito Vibe by up to Rs 36,000._line_ Other popular car manufacturers such as Renault, Nissan, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz and Jaguar also reduced prices on their respective models, with cut backs ranging from Rs 11,000 to as high as Rs 6 lakhs._line_'

S' Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 660 processor earlier this year in May. It\xe2\x80\x99s gradually making its way into more mid-range smartphones. A new rumor out of China brings us the purported technical specifications of the Snapdragon 660\xe2\x80\x99s successor.

It has 8 Kryo 260 CPU cores clocked at 2.2GHz. It was the first 600-series SoC from Qualcomm to have Kryo CPU.

It will likely have a 6 series GPU compared to the 5 series one found on the Snapdragon 660._line_It\xe2\x80\x99s claimed that Qualcomm is going to officially announce this processor early next year.

S'Chander Mohan _line_S PATU, or Subathu, is a small village-town in the Shimla Hills. A poor cousin of Kasauli, its only claim to fame has been the Gorkha Training Centre there. _line_When we were in school, our vacation in the hot months were spent there. It was the summer home of my maternal grandparents, where Pitaji spent his time reading while Maaji tended to the house and the flowers._line_There was no electricity in those days, no flush system in bathrooms and certainly no form of entertainment. Our daily excitement was to run 20 minutes to the bus stand to get a copy of The Tribune and the dak for Pitaji. _line_Kingston Lodge was where we stayed through our summer break, year after year. My parents eventually also bought a beautiful English-style house there, which blossomed with zinnias, roses, geraniums and such large dahlias that they are difficult to forget even today. _line_But at that young age, all this was something we did not have an eye for and hence failed to appreciate its beauty. Occasionally, from a spot called do bumbe (two taps), we would, on a clear day, look longingly at the faraway twinkling lights of Shimla. But that city would have to wait. _line_Spatu had nothing to offer to us, city kids. There was a small shop near the bus stand which sold lemon soda. At other times, we would run to the parade ground to watch the impressive march, but there was no interaction with military families. _line_That is not to say there were no civilians around. Our granduncle, the venerable Prof GD Sondhi, and grandaunt Leela were one such family living in Spatu. We dreaded being invited to their house for a meal, the table was so cluttered one didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to handle the cutlery or the crockery._line_Then there were Mr and Mrs Gardner who lived in a beautiful bungalow at the edge of a hill and Dr Khan who we, as children, suspected had only one injection for all ailments!_line_Gradually electricity came, washrooms became modern and every night at 9, the family would gather to listen to the news on a transistor. Very occasionally, we would also catch Amin Sayani\xe2\x80\x99s golden voice on Binaca Geetmala. _line_And suddenly it all came to an end. The young ones flew away. The grandparents became too old to travel and gradually died. The houses got sold and we lost our connection with Spatu. _line_Or so we thought. But Spatu never really left us because it shaped our childhood. We never valued it then, but now my cousins and I realise just how significant our time spent there was. Our love for the hills, outdoors, and nature was unknowingly ingrained during our days there. _line_I have never visited the town since, but while travelling to Shimla and crossing Dharampur, the gaze automatically turns left to the winding road that leads to Spatu, hoping on a clear day to catch a glimpse of the roof of the first military barrack there._line_In Jalandhar, I have a harsingar tree outside my bedroom. They say it was brought to earth by Lord Krishna. I claim no knowledge of such heavenly things, but I recollect from years gone by how its flower carpet emits a heavenly sweet fragrance. And yes, it reminds me of Spatu._line_'

If at all it was required, a review could have been taken after six months when the outcome of GST regime would have been clearer," he added._line_ Expressing similar views, Audi India Head Rahil Ansari said: "The taxes on this industry are already very high and this increase in cess rate will be detrimental to the luxury car industry as we will be forced to hike our prices to levels higher than pre-GST period"._line_ He asked the GST Council to "carefully evaluate the negative impact on this and, if a decision is taken on a 10 per cent cess increase, postpone the implementation for another 6-12 months to evaluate the real impact of the GST on the automobile sector, in particular the luxury segment"._line_ Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka, however, said the passing of ordinance to increase limit of cess to 25 per cent on certain class of vehicles, was along the expected lines._line_ "What is critical to the industry is when, how much and on what criteria will the cess be increased.Industry has made a representation to the government and we await the final decision," he added._line_ Jaguar Land Rover India Ltd President and Managing Director Rohit Suri said reduced prices after GST implementation had helped in expanding the market, which had been declining because of high taxation._line_ Expansion in demand would have helped the industry invest more in local manufacturing and job creation across the value chain, he added._line_ "We earnestly hope that the government and the GST Council will give due consideration to this matter and desist from raising the cess and putting a dampener on the positive momentum in demand that the industry had started to witness since July 1," Suri said._line_ Grant Thornton India Partner Sridhar V said the ordinance sets right the anomalies which crept in while the rates were finalised for the passenger car segment._line_ However, the additional 10 per cent cess will have a dampening impact on the otherwise increased demand expectation for luxury cars and SUV, which in recent times have been picking up, he added. _line_'

S"Getty Images_line_Handstands might look like they belong to gymnasts and superfit athletes, but we have good news: Any reasonably fit, able-bodied person can do one. Of course, the benefits of nailing a handstand translate to your whole body: Stronger back, stronger shoulders, superstrong core. It's a total-body exercise that is, more or less, just standing there. The trick, of course, is practice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no magical length of time it takes to master a handstand,\xe2\x80\x9d says Parinaz Samimi, a certified yoga instructor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes down to commitment and making time for a daily practice.\xe2\x80\x9d So if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to look like an Olympian without the years of training, here\xe2\x80\x99s your game plan._line_Start With Core Strength and Mobility_line_Samimi points to two exercises that serve as foundations for the handstand: bear crawls and plank holds:_line_Bear Crawl: According to Samimi, bear crawls are a great beginner exercise because they help you develop comfort with loading your body weight onto your hands and shoulders. They also force your upper and lower body to work in conjunction since your core activates as you transfer your weight forward, moving your limbs contralaterally. Incorporate bear-crawling into your warm-up, trying different variations as your upper-body strength and coordination improve._line_Plank Holds: Planks help develop static core strength, simultaneously targeting the shoulders, glutes, and quads, all muscles you must be able to control while holding a handstand. Plus, they also help you develop proper handstand form while in a horizontal position. Focus on creating a \xe2\x80\x9chollow core\xe2\x80\x9d by tucking your tailbone under and drawing your belly button and ribs toward your spine. Incorporate three sets of 45- to 90-second planks as part of your warm-up routine._line_Progress to Wall-Assisted Inversions_line_Wall handstands are the perfect first step toward a full handstand because, in addition to developing the strength necessary for the isometric hold, they also help you develop comfort with being upside down._line_L-Stand Against the Wall: According to Samimi, the L-Stand helps teach you how to correctly stack your hips over your shoulders while supporting yourself correctly on both hands. \xe2\x80\x9cBeginners often allow their shoulders to collapse,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in a handstand, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep the shoulder blades engaged while pulling the lats down the back, as you would during a pull-up.\xe2\x80\x9d Start in a downward dog position with the wall behind you, then walk your feet up the wall until your body is in an \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9d shape, your hips bent at 90 degrees, and your knees straight. Check to make sure your hands, shoulders, and hips are all stacked, perpendicular to the floor. Treat this as you would a plank \xe2\x80\x94 aim to do three to five sets of 15- to 30-second holds as part of your warm-up or cool-down._line_Wall Walks: Will Torres, the founder of mobility-focused training center WILLSPACE, points to wall walks as an ideal transitional exercise, as they develop strength, flexibility, and stamina. Start in a high plank or push-up position, then begin walking your feet up the wall behind you while maintaining a rigid body. As you walk your feet up, begin walking your hands back toward the wall. The goal is to get your chest as close to the wall as possible, eventually holding the position for a full minute. Perform three rounds of three to five reps, three times a week._line_Head Taps: Head taps are a progression from the wall walk that work on the unilateral strength of each arm. Torres says once you can hold proper handstand alignment for the entire prescribed wall walk rep scheme, add the head tap by taking one hand off the floor to tap your head (or the shoulder on the same side). Place it back down, then alternate sides. Perform three rounds of 10 reps per hand, three times a week._line_Full Handstands_line_Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve developed sufficient core stability and stabilization through each arm, you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to move on to the real deal._line_Kick-Ups Near Wall: The goal of kick-ups isn\xe2\x80\x99t to use the wall for balance, but to have it there \xe2\x80\x9cjust in case,\xe2\x80\x9d like a pair of training wheels on a bike. Torres suggest you warm up with three rounds of wall walks and one to two rounds of head taps. Then, turn to face the wall and enter a downward dog position with your hands just in front of the wall. Kick one leg up, aiming to find your balancing point before your foot touches the wall, then come back down. Alternate legs for three rounds of 10 reps per leg, three times a week. As you get better and more comfortable, gradually move farther away from the wall._line_Handstands: After about a week of working on kick-ups, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to attempt the handstand in an open space. Warm up with several sets of each progression, then perform a kick-up with no assistance. Hold the handstand as long as you can, and repeat. Aim to beat your own best time with each consecutive handstand._line_"

His large-scale land- and cityscapes were based mostly in the canaled city of Venice._line_Famous artworks_line_\xe2\x80\x9cAn Architectural Capriccio of a City,\xe2\x80\x9d 1736_line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe Piazza San Marco, Venice,\xe2\x80\x9d 1736-37_line_\xe2\x80\x9cSanta Maria della Salute, Venice, As Seen from the Grand Canal,\xe2\x80\x9d 1739-40_line_\xe2\x80\x9cVenice,\xe2\x80\x9d 1741_line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe Courtyard of the Doge\xe2\x80\x99s Palace, Venice,\xe2\x80\x9d 1775_line_An Unknown Past_line_The son of an engraver Antonio Marieschi, Michele was born in the winter of 1710 in the Italian metropolis of Venice. After the death of his father in 1721, he was taught the basic tenets of art from his maternal grandfather, set designer Antonio Meneghini. There is little other documentation of his childhood and the facts of his early life have eluded biographers for generations. _line_According to Orlandi and Guarienti, who wrote the artists\xe2\x80\x99 manual \xe2\x80\x9cAbecedario Pittorico,\xe2\x80\x9d (published in 1753) Marieschi was educated in Germany and returned to Venice only at the age of 25 to establish himself as a great painter of vedute. However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it is equally likely that he started out in theatre. Gaspare Diziani, who painted sets at Francesco Tasso\xe2\x80\x99s studio, was a teacher to Marieschi. _line_Capriccio and Vedute_line_Between 1736 and 1741, Marieschi was a member of the Fraglia Dei Pittori (The Painters\xe2\x80\x99 Guild). Under the influence of Luca Carlevaris and Marco Ricci, he began working with capriccios, a kind of landscape art based on fantastical architectural images, a fictional fusing of different buildings in impossible combinations. The most well known of his pieces from this time are \xe2\x80\x9cCapriccio with Classical Ruins and Bridge\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCapriccio with Roman Arch and Encampment,\xe2\x80\x9d painted in Naples in the mid-1730s. _line_He was equally interested in vedute \xe2\x80\x94 highly detailed large-scale canvases more akin to prints than paintings, made famous by his contemporary Canaletto. But unlike his colleague, Marieschi depicted the romanticized ideal of Venice, exaggerating perspectives and animating his human figures in works such as \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Canal at Ca\xe2\x80\x99 Pesaro,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cS. Maria Della Salute,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPiazzetta Dei Leoni.\xe2\x80\x9d The well-known art collector Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg bought two works by Marieschi._line_In 1737, Marieschi married Angelo Fontana, the child of Venice\xe2\x80\x99s principal art dealer. Taking advantage of both his position and location, he supplied the Fontana gallery in San Luca with a number of cityscapes and invented sites marketing the foreigners congregating to Venice as part of the Grand Tour. _line_Marieschi left the guild in early 1741, preferring to operate independently. Unfortunately, he died very suddenly at the age of 33. His student Francesco Albotto took over his studio and went on to marry Angelo Fontana a few years later. _line_Timeline_line_1710 - Born in Venice_line_1731 - Prepares the setting for the Carnival Thursday celebrations_line_1735 - Attends the funeral of Mara Clementina_line_1736 - Becomes a member of the Guild of Painters in Venice; receives payment from Marshal Schulenberg for compositions of the Rialto and the Doge\xe2\x80\x99s palace_line_1741 - Publishes a series of 21 etchings_line_1744 - Dies in Venice_line_Museums /Collections:_line_National Gallery, London_line_Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg_line_Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, British Columbia_line_Gallerie dell\xe2\x80\x99Accademia, Venice_line_Gellerie di Palazzo Leoni Montanari, Vicenza, Italy_line_Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA_line_North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA_line_Philadelpha Museum of Art, Philadelphia_line_Oglethorpe University Museum, Atlanta_line_Statens Museum for Kunst at the National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen_line_Harvard University Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA_line_Irkutsk Regional Art Museum, Irkutsk, Russia_line_Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, St. Louis, Missouri, USA_line_Books / publications_line_\xe2\x80\x9cPainting in 18th Century Venice\xe2\x80\x9d by Michael Levey_line_\xe2\x80\x9cMichiel Marieschi\xe2\x80\x9d by Fabio Mauroner_line_\xe2\x80\x9cArt and Architecture Italy\xe2\x80\x9d by Rudolf Wittkower_line_\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificentiores Selectioresque Urbis Venetiarum Prospectus\xe2\x80\x9d by Michele Marieschi_line_'

S' NEW DELHI: From Houston all the way to Mumbai and from Nepal to the desert state of Rajasthan, rains have cut a swathe of destruction with flooded streets and thousands marooned as their cities and villages go under. _line_ With people across the globe dealing with the humanitarian and economic fallout of unusually heavy rains this year, are extreme weather events the new normal? _line_ Scientists, meteorologists and climate change experts blame rising global temperatures for the erratic weather patterns, leading to instances like heavy rains and floods. _line_ Heavy rainfall, cloudbursts, thunderstorms and heat waves are indeed becoming the new normal, said former India Meteorological Department (IMD) director general Laxman Singh Rathore. _line_ A worrying trend, added the consultant with the World Bank for South Asia on Climate Change, was that "periodicity and severity" had increased. _line_ "In case of rainfall, the average precipitation has more or less remained the same, the dry spells have increased but the amount of rainfall remains the same. This means there is heavy concentration of rainfall over a particular region while other areas go dry," explained Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. _line_ IMD recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1901. And, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report on climate change, observations since 1950 show changes in some extreme events, particularly daily temperature extremes and heat waves. _line_ The IPCC report also noted that it is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in the 21st century over many regions. _line_ The numbers are alarming. _line_ According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 41 million people have been affected due to torrential rains in India, Nepal and Bangladesh this year. _line_ Nearly 900 people have died in the three countries, a report on the UN news website said. _line_ An IMD report added that 1,600 people in India died due to extreme heatwave conditions which 475 lives were lost in floods and thunderstorms in 2016. _line_ Rathore said South Asian countries have been affected due to torrential rains and floods because of high population density. _line_ But how does global warming lead to heavy rainfall? _line_ Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist researching climate change with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, a premium institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, explained that the atmosphere and the oceans were getting warmer due to increasing carbon dioxide, a result of human activities. _line_ "A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. This results in two factors. The first is that warm moist air is lighter than cold dry air and hence makes the atmosphere unstable as it rises up," said Koll. _line_ The second factor, he added, is that since the atmosphere holds more moisture, it dumps it all together -- a heavy rainfall event. _line_ These factors leads to erratic weather, including extreme rainfall events across the globe. _line_ There are domestic factors, too, that aggravate losses in times of extreme weather. _line_ Former IMD DG Rathore pointed out that in case of cities, natural drainage systems have been "altered" at the cost of infrastructure development. _line_ One major reason for the 2005 Mumbai deluge, in which more than 500 people were killed with 944 mm of rain in a single day, was the damage done to natural drainage systems like the Mithi river. The river, which runs through the suburbs, has been revived to some extent now. _line_ Vineet Kumar, programme officer (Climate Change) with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said research on climate change and its effects was insufficient for exigency plans at the micro-level. _line_ "Due to this, there is a huge gap in planning a policy to deal with the problems occurring due to climate change. For instance, there are not enough studies on the adverse impact on crops due to this phenomenon to come up with a policy on how to deal with it," Kumar said. _line_ As states like Bihar count their dead -- an estimated 500 killed in the floods this year alone -- and Mumbai gets back on its feet after the heavy rains yesterday, the hope is that next year will be different. _line_'

S'At CES 2017 earlier this year, the folks at Misfit took the wraps off a new wearable in the form of the Vapor smartwatch. While smartwatch launches aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly new, this marked the first touchscreen smartwatch from the company.

No word on why the smartwatch has been delayed, but either way those who want it will have to remain patient for now._line_ Advertisement. Article continues below _line_Unfortunately its delay also means that Misfit will be ceding potential market share to its competitors, such as Apple who is expected to launch the Apple Watch Series 3 in September, and Samsung who is set to unveil new wearables at IFA 2017 tomorrow. However one of the things the Misfit Vapor has going for it is that it is priced at $199 which is cheaper than some of the options out there, so there\xe2\x80\x99s that._line_In terms of specs/features, the Vapor will feature a 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen display, 4GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 2100 chipset, and water-resistance up to 50 meters.

S' Premal Badiani on how she has weaved her personal experience into her collection for the upcoming New York Fashion Week _line_Early this year, she used fashion for intensifying efforts to make our planet green. This time round for the New York Fashion Week, Premal Badiani, an Indian-American haute couture designer, is extending support to breast cancer survivors. She is encouraging them to embrace womanhood with confidence and a touch of sensuality. Survivors will be walking the ramp on September 8._line_The U.S.-based designer has used her first hand experience to create the collection Valencia, which means brave._line_\xe2\x80\x9cHaving lost a dear one to breast cancer, this cause is extremely close to me. As fashion designers, sometimes we get to wear our hearts on our sleeves, making personal connection to the causes that are close to us. For me, this collection has been very liberating and fulfilling experience,\xe2\x80\x9d reveals the designer._line_Describing breast cancer as a dark subject, Premal says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are designing a collection to pay a tribute to women who have suffered so much, it becomes a very sensitive subject. I wanted to design a collection which makes these women feel confident and sensual. A collection that sees beyond the scars and depression. Designing a collection that tackles the psychological well being of the fighters rather than the physical scars was the most challenging part.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Colour patterns are interesting and insightful. \xe2\x80\x9cThis collection is a tribute to every fighter. I want to make women, who are permanently scarred, look good and desirable. It is about their emotional well being. Scars can be hidden, hair can be regrown but they are scarred emotionally. Therefore, the colour palette of hues of pink has been carefully chosen keeping in mind awareness on this disease. The designs have soft and fluid hand-crafted evening drapes with summer hues of dusky pinks, greys and greens on variety of silk weaves textured with mesh which gives sensuality to ensembles.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Noting that she has been pursuing the Make in India mantra in every collection, Premal says: \xe2\x80\x9cAll my collections and designs have an Indian touch; I am deeply rooted with my heritage. My production houses are set up in Mumbai and Faridabad. Fabric for all outfits to be shown on runway have been sourced from India. We have been recognised at New York Fashion Week for our exquisite Indian embroidery and craftsmanship. I am proud of showcasing deep links to my Indian roots in every design.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Explaining how she will be showcasing a mix of Indian embroidery and American culture, she says: \xe2\x80\x9cSharp contrasts between ancient traditions and uber modernity has always fascinated me. Born in England, growing up in India and settled in the U.S. has given me a huge cultural insight. It has been the key influencer behind my designing technique. So this collection will be a fine balance between exquisite craftmanship of Indian hand embroidery and European inspired pattern on structured American silhouettes. For the first time we have experimented by creating handcrafted 3D embroidery on top of European floral patterns.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Last time, she had used eco-friendly fabrics in her collection Root Cause. \xe2\x80\x9cInspiration was to raise awareness of the human impact on the environment and to promote social responsibility by adopting sustainable fashion as a lifestyle choice. We need to care about the planet not as a seasonal choice but all year round. Now we are using fabrics of soft pure satin and mesh; they would go well with evening wear.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The collection will be available in India later this year._line_'

He proudly displayed his dead customer\xe2\x80\x99s ashes on national TV after they died from eating his food._line_Customers routinely experience heart attacks and chest pains at his restaurant._line_It\xe2\x80\x99s an extreme example but it teaches us something important._line_Making a stand on any issue will attract some customers and repel others. Standing for this excludes that. If you\xe2\x80\x99re running an agency that\xe2\x80\x99s all about ethical marketing practices, you\xe2\x80\x99ll repel grey hat customers who want you to \xe2\x80\x9cpush the envelope.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Remember, positive emotions draw your target customers in, triggering a natural desire to learn more. Negative emotions cement customer memories, signaling danger and warning them to stay away._line_3. First impressions are permanent-ish_line_Professor Vivian Zayas, psychologist at Cornell University, wanted an answer to the question \xe2\x80\x93 are first impressions permanent?_line_So she ran an experiment._line_Zayas and her colleagues, Gul Gunaydin and Emre Selcuk had participants look at several photos of people. They asked them about their first impressions based on those pictures._line_They waited a month._line_Then they invited participants back to the laboratory to interact with people. What these participants didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize is that they were engaging with the very same people they had seen in photos a month earlier._line_Here\xe2\x80\x99s where things get interesting._line_Here\xe2\x80\x99s what Zayas and her team found. Not only did people draw the same exact conclusions about the people they met face to face, but they acted in ways to make their first impressions come true._line_Their participants deliberately tried to influence and confirm their first impressions!_line_It gets worse._line_ Recommended for You _line_Research by Nicholas Rule of the University of Toronto, found that not even facts can change first impressions._line_This can be dangerous if it causes us to extrapolate or generalize our first impressions. A customer who has a bad experience with a used car salesman may make a permanent assessment of their character._line_From a customer\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint, their first impression is your fault, (even when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t)._line_What this means for your reviews:_line_Comcast has had a long history of poor customer service, and horrible reviews._line_They\xe2\x80\x99ve changed their customer\xe2\x80\x99s names to \xe2\x80\x9cAsshole Brown\xe2\x80\x9d,_line_Whore Julia\xe2\x80\xa6_line_and Dummy._line_Comcast was listed as the worst company in America in 2014. They created such a bad first impression with customers that many are simply unwilling to do business with them._line_They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken dramatic steps to improve things._line_They tried with a lengthy PR campaign that failed. They tried to rebrand themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cXfinity.\xe2\x80\x9d But they just can\xe2\x80\x99t get customers to forget about their past mistakes. It haunts them, creating open hostility and conflict. Conditioning customers to expect the worst and leave more bad reviews._line_As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, first impressions are incredibly difficult to shake. Make the wrong moves, become known for the wrong things and that perception just may become permanent. A devastating outcome if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for positive customer reviews._line_What if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the first impressions customers have of you? That\xe2\x80\x99s an easy to fix problem._line_Just ask your customers._line_Anonymously of course. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been conditioned to be nice to each other. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing except when you want customers to be honest with you. Asking them about their experiences from time to time (besides the post-sale request for reviews) enables you to keep track of customer sentiment._line_4. First impressions are typically very accurate_line_When it comes to determining trustworthiness, our first impressions are incredibly accurate. Research from the University of California, Berkeley suggests it takes just 20 seconds to determine if a stranger is trustworthy or not._line_Aleksandr Kogan et al. found that participants in the study were able to look at a 20-second video clip and accurately determine whether someone was trustworthy, kind and/or compassionate._line_A research team, led by Jeremy Biesanz of the University of British Columbia, found that for the most part, people know when their first impressions are accurate._line_Their research showed that impressions can be accurate even with very short interactions._line_An accurate assessment of trustworthiness in a matter of seconds._line_What this means for your reviews:_line_As the web has matured, customers have become more and more sophisticated. They\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the power they have. What\xe2\x80\x99s worse, they believe their first impressions are always right._line_The downside? They\xe2\x80\x99re usually right._line_So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the best approach if you find yourself in this situation? Own your mistakes, then work to change them. Do it in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abuse, humiliate or alienate your customers._line_Wait a minute._line_Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I just say first impressions are permanent? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that mean\xe2\x80\xa6_line_A first impression can\xe2\x80\x99t be changed?_line_Actually no._line_You can change a first impression, if you know how. But it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to get things right the first time. The unfortunate part is that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t always possible._line_So what do you do?_line_If you find yourself in a terrible spot or an unfair situation what can you do to contain and change a negative first impression?_line_1. Surprise your customers. Apple is known for their strict limited warranties. Customers believe Apple to be unwilling to repair or replace products covered by warranty. A Reddit user by the name of n00bvin was distraught. He dropped his Macbook and was out $1,200 dollars. When he visited the Apple store, employees surprised him with a free replacement._line_2. Overcompensate. Chipotle has been hammered by food safety scandals. Tainted food, major outbreaks, E. Coli and Norovirus. So they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone above and beyond. They\xe2\x80\x99ve over-compensated. They\xe2\x80\x99ve closed stores, completely overhauled their storage and food prep procedures. Apologized to customers. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done their best to show that things are different now. And it\xe2\x80\x99s working. The lesson? Overcompensate to overcome a negative first impression._line_3. Build a close(r) relationship. Zappos is known for their amazing customer service. Customers arrive with that perception. So what does Zappos do? They continue to be excellent. They show customers they care and continue to reinforce the positive first impression customers have of them. The rest, as they say, is history._line_4. Continue to be excellent. If your customer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of you is based on a past negative experience there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot you can do. Challenge their opinion and you make their negative impression stronger. Try to convince them and you prove their point. Your only option with a customer who\xe2\x80\x99s projecting is simply this: Continue to be excellent. They\xe2\x80\x99ll come around in time._line_First impressions are hard, but not impossible to change. You can change a negative first impression, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to invest the time and effort._line_Want the easier route?_line_Build a positive first impression from the beginning, then, work to maintain it. Protect your reputation and your perception in customers eyes._line_Amazing five-star reviews follow naturally._line_First impressions help or hurt your business_line_Make a good first impression and you\xe2\x80\x99re able to attract a significant amount of goodwill from customers. This insulates your business from negative reviews, even when you make a mistake. Make a poor first impression and you face an uphill battle._line_Customers are fair\xe2\x80\xa6_line_If they know you genuinely care about them. Show them through your actions that you care, continue to be excellent and first impressions won\xe2\x80\x99t matter as much._line_With some upfront planning and conscientious effort, customers will see you for what you are._line_Amazing all the time._line_'

S'Find new & used cars_line_What is this?_line_It might not give many visual cues \xe2\x80\x93 the non-functional quad-tipped exhausts and new wheel design being the only non-verbal hints \xe2\x80\x93 that this Grand Cherokee is packing some serious extra heat. On first read you could easily mistake this as the regular 392-engined SRT Jeep. But the giveaway when you look a little closer is right there, writ large on each of the front doors. This is no normal Jeep GC. This one is supercharged._line_Which in the US FCA family today means it\xe2\x80\x99s fitted with the company\xe2\x80\x99s 707bhp 6.2-litre V8 monster engine, as first fitted in the Hellcat Charger and Challenger. And then most recently, with some trick upgrades and another 133bhp, in the Demon. Which in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s language means it\xe2\x80\x99s fast. Really, really fast._line_How fast?_line_Try a 180mph unlimited top speed allied to a 3.3-second 0-60mph time \xe2\x80\x93 we know, we did it several times, just to be sure. That makes it quicker to 60mph than most cars with exotic names. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as fast as the Tesla in Ludicrous mode. And, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as fast as the Nissan GT-R. But, this is a Jeep SUV weighing 2,433kg which can tow 3,266kg and can travel incognito right up until the point you simply disappear at the lights._line_But it can\xe2\x80\x99t handle, can it?_line_Not like a sports car, no. The extra 100lb+ weight of the big engine is right up there at the front, helping to induce understeer. So you\xe2\x80\x99d be forgiven for thinking that it pushes like a bulldozer through every corner. And it does if you just try to get it through the corner on steering alone. The trick, which SRT\xe2\x80\x99s engineers - all avid racers - will tell you is you have to steer with the throttle._line_A Jeep you steer on the throttle?_line_As unlikely as it may seem, they have designed and built in a level of lift-off oversteer in Track mode that gets the big rig rotated and into the corner more easily than you could imagine. Line it up, lift off until the nose is pointing at the corner exit, then pound the throttle, unleash all those horses and it rushes through the corner like a scalded bull elephant. Hilarious._line_What about that 0-60mph time. Easy to achieve?_line_Yes, very. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be simpler. Just press the launch control button, squash the brake pedal, then the throttle, sidestep the brake and BOOM! You are off the line in a haze of 1.4g acceleration, tyre squeal and supercharger roar. Then, if you followed those instructions, just 3.4 seconds or less \xe2\x80\x93 our best time was 3.3 seconds \xe2\x80\x93 you will sweep past 60mph and whatever car was stupid enough to challenge you to a race._line_How reliable is that going to be? Can\xe2\x80\x99t last long, surely?_line_The system was tested by doing over 150 consecutive launches on three different types of tyre \xe2\x80\x93 all season, sport compound and slicks. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t break then and it gave us zero sign that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as happy as we were to keep doing it until its petrol ran out._line_How does it manage that reliably?_line_The Trackhawk\xe2\x80\x99s real secret is that the Jeep guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t scrimp on beefing up the drivetrain when they installed the Hellcat motor up front. Every single component downstream of it, other than the bits which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be changed for packaging reasons, has been given super strength. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find metals strong enough in the automotive field, so they used aeronautical stuff instead. Reassuringly expensive aeronautical stuff._line_What\xe2\x80\x99s it like on the road?_line_Just like every other Grand Cherokee, just with a newly explosive Jekyll and Hyde character. It will cruise quietly, the engine sound melting into the breeze, but stab the throttle to pass a truck \xe2\x80\x93 or just because you feel like it \xe2\x80\x93 and it drops several gears before positively exploding into life with that trademark Hellcat bellow. It might be a little quieter here than in the other Hellcat equipped cars, but there is, we are told, an easily removed resonator which quickly will restore any lost voice\xe2\x80\xa6_line_They have designed and built in a level of lift-off oversteer in Track mode that gets the big rig rotated and into the corner more easily than you could imagine_line_Handling wise, the standard 392 SRT GC is sweeter and lighter on its toes. No question. The extra weight up front gives the Trackhawk more of a deliberate, slightly slower battleship feel than its lower-powered sibling. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not anything extreme. Plus you can always counteract any directional delay with a blast on the accelerator._line_Anything else I should know?_line_The only other remarkable thing is that it does all of this without any sacrifice in any other area of the car. It is still the practical workhorse you expect a Jeep Grand Cherokee to be, complete with five seats, a yawning rear load area and all the flexibility you want. Plus, as I mentioned above, it can tow over 7,200lb. So it\xe2\x80\x99s very fast, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still just as practical and rational as ever._line_So should I buy one?_line_The Trackhawk was designed and built to beat the best super SUVs in the world. The development benchmarks included the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and SVR Range Rover Sport. Fair to say it\xe2\x80\x99s crushed that brief. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just out accelerate them and walk past them on top end, it also manages to have a great sense of humour and theatre about the way it does everything. So, yes, you should if you can. The Hellcat engine turned the Charger and Challenger from contenders into winners. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s done the same for the Grand Cherokee. Starting at $85k we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a bargain. But it is. And a hilarious one at that._line_'

All day today and yesterday, we\'ve been receiving supplies," Osteen told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo, responding to criticism that he didn\'t open Lakewood Church to the needy soon enough. _line_As flooding ravaged parts of Houston and left thousands without shelter, Twitter users lambasted the televangelist, saying he should have opened Lakewood sooner. _line_But the church complex, which can hold more than 16,000 people, was "inaccessible due to severe flooding," its staff reported on social media Sunday afternoon. Photos provided by the church Monday to CNN show flooding inside a building and on a street._line_By Monday night, a few hundred people had arrived at Lakewood by bus, Osteen\'s brother-in-law, Don Iloff, told CNN\'s Erin Burnett. _line_Early Tuesday morning, Osteen told CNN his church would "continue to be a distribution center for those in need," adding: "We are prepared to shelter people once the cities and county shelters reach capacity." _line_And by late Tuesday morning, when the shelter at the city\'s convention center reported twice as many evacuees as its capacity, Osteen\'s facility was publicly welcoming displaced Houstonians, Osteen tweeted._line_Osteen said Wednesday he wasn\'t sure "how this notion got started that we\'re not a shelter and we\'re not taking people," calling it a "false narrative."_line_"There was a time, Chris, that the place was flooded," Osteen told Cuomo. "There was a safety issue the first day or two. ... We would never put people in here until we know that it\'s safe, and it was not safe those days, let me tell you."_line_The church "has always been open," Osteen said. A handful of staff and maintenance workers rode out of the worst of Harvey at the facility to keep tabs on flooding, Iloff said._line_'

In August 2005, Katrina wiped out some 500,000-600,000 vehicles but William Armstrong of CL King warns that Houston has about 5x more people than New Orleans did at the time._line_Hurricane Harvey could damage more vehicles than Hurricane Katrina, driving business to the salvage auctions operated by Copart and KAR Auction Services, CL King analyst William Armstrong wrote in a note._line_Katrina damaged 500,000-600,000 vehicles in August 2005, and the greater Houston MSA is five times as populous as pre-Katrina New Orleans._line_The cost of dealing with catastrophes can be higher than normal given vehicle extraction, towing and temporary storage and auction locations, though both companies have grown their physical presence in Texas over the last year, which should lower the need for temporary locations._line_It may be 2-3 months or longer until damaged vehicles are sold at auction._line_Of course, storms of this magnitude bring not only millions in salvage-related charge offs for the auto industry but a loss of critical "selling days" for one of the biggest markets in the country. As CNBC points out this morning, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli figures Hurricane Harvey could knock about 500,000 units off the August auto SAAR to be reported later this week._line_Given the widespread flooding that will swamp dealerships and kill potential sales, analysts are bringing down estimates for the August new vehicle sales in the U.S._line_Citi analyst Itay Michaeli has cut his estimate for the rate of monthly auto sales in August, which are reported on Friday. He estimates Harvey will affect some 125 counties in Texas and about 60 percent of the state\'s auto sales._line_Before Harvey, Michaeli estimated the August sales pace for the country was going to be in the mid-$16 million range. As the storm lingers over the area, Michaeli has dropped his estimate._line_"Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Harvey could push this down to the low-$16 million unit range," Michaeli wrote in a note to clients._line_In terms of the publicly traded used car dealers, Stephens analyst Rick Nelson notes that Group 1 Automotive has the heaviest exposure to Hurricane Harvey, with ~37% of revenues from Texas, followed by Sonic (~25%) and AutoNation (~21%). Meanwhile, Autonation CEO Marc Cannon appeared on CNBC this morning to discuss the devastation:_line_"This is bad; real bad," said Marc Cannon, an AutoNation executive vice president. "Right now, we are focused on making sure all of our employees are safe and taken care of. At the same time, we\'re focusing on getting all of our stores up and running."_line_AutoNation\'s 18 dealerships in the Houston area are shut down. Widespread flooding has not only swamped thousands of buildings in the Houston area, it\'s likely damaged hundreds, perhaps thousands of new cars and trucks parked on dealership lots._line_"We\'re holding calls with our staff every three hours," Cannon said. "We have reopened our stores in Corpus Christi and Austin, but some of the Houston stores may take some time."_line_Then, for the \'less reputable\' used car dealers, no good crisis can be allowed to go to waste. As carfax points out, if previous hurricanes are any example, roughly half of the cars flooded by Hurricane Harvey will eventually be sold with no flood label to unsuspecting consumers._line_Of course, when the auto OEMs report abysmal sales this Friday they will undoubtedly also tell you how Hurricane Harvey is great for long-term sales because of all the salvaged cars that have to be replaced._line_'

S'Corporate America is striving to be healthier. CEOs have implemented numerous programs, such as employee wellness programs, onsite gyms and walking meetings. Executives are trying to lead by example by taking vacations and leaving the office at a reasonable hour. More and more people are embracing a healthy lifestyle. Yet even the most stalwart health enthusiasts struggle to maintain that lifestyle when they are traveling. People usually return from business trips feeling drained and unproductive. This \xe2\x80\x9cThree Days of Wellness\xe2\x80\x9d series is meant to help you incorporate a wellness lifestyle into your travel plans\xe2\x80\x94whether for business or pleasure\xe2\x80\x94so you return to work feeling energized and more creative._line_San Francisco is a popular destination for business as well as leisure. This dynamic city has something for everyone\xe2\x80\x94historic attractions, superb restaurants, mild weather and beautiful views of the San Francisco Bay. The secret to incorporating wellness into your trip here is to embrace the beauty of your surroundings._line_The Bay City is one of the most expensive destinations for business travelers. So if you are able to choose your accommodations, consider treating yourself to a bit of luxury. Cavallo Point is located at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. You can choose either a historic or more modern, green hotel room. Both feature the finest amenities and modern day conveniences. The lodge has a variety of spa treatments, healing arts services and integrative medicine services._line_Photo courtesy of Cavallo Point Lodge in San Francisco._line_Day one: Enjoy the process of creating a five-course meal _line_After a day spent in business meetings or touring the sites, sign up for Cavallo Point\xe2\x80\x99s Chef Counter experience. You can enjoy an exquisite five-course meal that is prepared by world-class Chef Tony Adams. The experience will help you embrace one of the key tenets of a wellness lifestyle\xe2\x80\x94you have to enjoy the process more than you enjoy the product. Chef Adams doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just cook in front of you. He teaches you about the ingredients and explains how to prepare them. Seeing a culinary artist at work is the process. A delectable meal is the end product. The experience teaches you the process of how an artist creates his product, which you can use to nurture your own creativity._line_If you are a foodie or have more time to spend, you can also participate in one of Cavallo Point\xe2\x80\x99s cooking schools. The lodge has three different participation levels depending on how involved you want to be in the cooking process. You can help prepare some of the meal while socializing with friends and receiving chef assistance or you can prepare the whole meal yourself based on chef demos._line_Day two: Connect with nature_line_One of the most common mistakes that people make during business trips and vacations is trying to pack too much into a single day. Going nonstop without taking a moment to breathe is why you return feeling like you need a vacation from your vacation. Sometimes in business it\xe2\x80\x99s unavoidable. But you should ask yourself what is mandatory and does the schedule allow time for a break. If it does, head outside for some fresh air. Studies have shown that frequent breaks help increase productivity and may even inspire that \xe2\x80\x9caha\xe2\x80\x9d moment you need. One of the perks of being in San Francisco is you can choose mountain or beach views as your escape into nature\xe2\x80\x94both of which are a short 40-minute drive from downtown San Francisco, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge._line_San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Mount Tamalpais State Park. Photo credit: [+] [-] Shutterstock_line_Mount Tamalpais State Park boasts redwood forests, open grasslands and breathtaking bay views from the 2,571-foot peak of Mount Tamalpais. You can drive to the park\xe2\x80\x99s East Peak Trailhead and from there it\xe2\x80\x99s a short hike to enjoy views of the entire bay area. Muir Beach is a quiet cove where you can have a peaceful respite to recharge your mind and body. From the Muir Beach Overlook you may even be fortunate enough to spot whales during their winter migration. Taking a nature excursion may be just what your mind needs to boost your creativity at work. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t change your landscape, you don\xe2\x80\x99t change your thoughts. Just remember to turn off your mind, take a moment to breathe and simply enjoy the beauty that surrounds you._line_On your way back to downtown, you can grab a bite to eat at The Pelican Inn. They have a beautiful lawn garden seating area and the beets-and-watercress salad is delicious._line_Day three: Find a moment to reflect_line_Reflection is an important part of a wellness lifestyle. This process allows you to make sure that you are taking care of your mind and body. You can ask yourself how the business meetings went and whether you are feeling stressed. Determine if you are on the right track or if you need to reevaluate how a project is going. This process will enable you to adjust your mindset as needed. Your last day in San Francisco is the perfect day for reflection. And one of the perfect places to reflect is the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, also known as Green Dragon Temple. It is a Buddhist practice center that offers a number of programs, such as Buddhist philosophy classes, tea gatherings in a traditional Japanese teahouse and classes in organic farming and flower arranging. It is a beautiful setting to visit and reflect on your trip and future goals._line_Before leaving San Francisco, you may want to squeeze in a trip to Berkley and dine at the Chez Panisse Caf\xc3\xa9. The restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s founder, Alice Waters, has been on the forefront of farm-to-table dining for decades and the food showcases the region\xe2\x80\x99s local sustainable ingredients. Not to mention that the hour drive to Berkley provides another opportunity to reflect on your trip._line_Photo courtesy of Chez Panissein Berkley, California._line_The goal of the three days of wellness itinerary is to help you identify how to live a wellness lifestyle when you are on the road. Incorporating some or all of these excursions will help you turn off so that when you turn back on you are inspired to do your best work. How well you turn off is directly related to how intensely you turn on._line_'

S'I recently sat down with Joe Pulizzi, Founder and CEO of Content Marketing Institute. We discussed his new book Killing Marketing, which is essentially about making marketing a profit center. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me? Read on or watch my video conversation with Joe below._line_What is Killing Marketing About_line_Joe co-authored this book with Robert Rose, Chief Strategy Officer at Content Marketing Institute. The rumor is that Joe and Robert Rose are out to \xe2\x80\x9ckill marketing\xe2\x80\x9d as we know it. In their new book, they discuss the future of marketing as a profit center, which is why they chose a provocative title. Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it \xe2\x80\x94 most marketers don\xe2\x80\x99t think that way._line_The book is about how to build a loyal audience and a business model to launch new revenue lines never thought of before. Rather than traditional, interruptive marketing, you can learn the needs of your audience because they want to share that information with the brand. Build a strong relationship with that audience. Rather than just selling them our products, we can learn from them to discover new ways to serve them and generate revenue._line_This strategy requires a 12 to 18 month investment. Building a loyal audience doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight. Most marketers would be skeptical about this approach to marketing. But, now we have tangible examples of brands who focus on building an audience._line_This approach to marketing is not for all brands, but the most innovative brands will do it. Some brands succeeding at this approach to marketing include RedBull, Pepsi, Mondalay, Kraft, Marriott, and Arrow Electronics. Kraftrecipes.com gathers data from their audience to spot trends and guide their new product developments. They\xe2\x80\x99re treating marketing as an R&D department._line_It takes commitment and patience to build an audience. Arrow Electronics decided not to build an audience. So they\xe2\x80\x99ve acquired 51 media brands. Through their media properties, they reach 76% of their total addressable audience. This model is profitable for them. And, they gain more insight into their customers._line_Who Should Read Killing Marketing_line_The intended reader of Killing Marketing is the marketing leader, the CEO of a smaller company, and sales and marketing practitioners. This is the new marketing. Some have had trouble selling \xe2\x80\x9caudience building\xe2\x80\x9d as a strategy to internal stakeholders. Killing Marketing will help convince the skeptics._line_The book will be available September 19th, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re attending Content Marketing World, you can buy your copy there. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we start redefining marketing to focus on building an audience. The modern consumer needs a modern marketer. This book from two top marketing experts shows how businesses can transform their marketing strategies into a standalone profit center. Preorder your copy on Amazon._line_'

S'Contrary to popular belief, really chic women aren\'t superhuman \xe2\x80\x94 they\'re just well-prepared. If you don\'t see them running around with week-old coffee stains on their blouses or hobbling in painful heels, it\'s not because those things just don\'t happen to them. It\'s because they know how to deal. _line_In fact, they\'re dealing on a daily basis. Truth is, the fashionable friends you envy have some very helpful habits that make looking polished, confident, and cool a daily reality. It\'s not about a total wardrobe overhaul or dropping tons of cash on the season\'s biggest trends. Real style starts at home the moment you wake up. We\'ve done the research \xe2\x80\x94 all you have to do is read on for the takeaways you can start practicing right now. _line_Plan Their Outfit the Night Before : It\'s not magic \xe2\x80\x94 or rocket science. The pulled-together women you see out and about really did try to look that way. And it all starts by pulling out the outfit the night before to save you from running around in a panic the next morning. Give Themselves Plenty of Time to Get Ready : This goes hand in hand with readying your outfit at bedtime. Instead of waking up three snooze alarms later, take the morning to prep your outfit and fix your hair. Not only will it save you from running out of the house with a button unfastened or mismatched shoes, but it\'ll also give you a few extra minutes to add a belt or a special piece of jewelry to polish off the look. Select the Right Undergarments: Stylish women know the foundation of a great look is good underwear. Plan for the fabric and silhouette of your look with the right bra, panties, and shapewear to provide the support you need, whether it\'s to ensure you\'re not inadvertently giving your office a peep show when you forget your slip or preventing a nip slip on date night._line_Follow Other Stylish Women For Inspiration : Stylish women may craft a look all their own, but that doesn\'t come without studying fashion icons and other ladies with killer style. The easiest place to get inspired? Scrolling through your Instagram feed or Pinterest board on the regular to get outfit ideas and endless fodder for your daily look at the office \xe2\x80\x94 and beyond. Dress For the Weather : It sounds simple enough, but dressing sensibly goes a long way in the style department. Check the weather before you leave the house to avoid being that girl trudging through the snow in her flats or dodging puddles in your wide-leg flares. Dress For the Occasion : The well-dressed women in the room are always the ones who got the dress code memo. They look polished and appropriate \xe2\x80\x94 never the ones tugging at their miniskirt in a room full of more conservative looks. If you\'re ever on the fence about an out-there top or flashy skirt, remember to consider where you\'re going and who you\'ll see. There\'s a time and a place for that plunging neckline \xe2\x80\x94 but it may not be at your boss\'s dinner party._line_Only Wear Clothes that Fit and Flatter : Sure, even the most fashionable women among us probably have a pair of "skinny" jeans they\'re waiting to fit back into or a top that got taken to the cleaners and was never the same, but they don\'t wear them. Despite how much you love something in your wardrobe, if it doesn\'t fit, it\'s just time to let it go. Anchor Their Look With One Expensive-Looking Piece : Ever wonder how some women make even jeans and a t-shirt look impossibly chic? It has a lot to do with the fit, of course, but there\'s another subtle way these ladies are elevating their outfit. It might be a great leather belt, a special pair of earrings, or a luxe bag, but in every case, one expensive-looking accessory adds infinitely more polish. Pick the Perfect Accessory : Like Coco Chanel famously dictated, "when accessorizing, always take off the last thing you put on." There is a point at which it becomes just too much, and the chicest women know exactly what that point is. Ask yourself if you really need the scarf and the statement necklace? Often, the cut of your clothes \xe2\x80\x94 an exposed neckline or bare arms \xe2\x80\x94 is a great help in determining just what jewelry or accoutrements to pair with it._line_Never Lounge in Their "Good" Clothes : The reason why stylish women\'s clothes never look crumpled? They\'re not lounging in their blazers or silk dresses on the couch. Curl up in your favorite leggings or sweatpants, but please, don\'t do it in your poplin blouse. Fold and Hang Up Their Clothes : Your blouses and trousers aren\'t just going to magically unwrinkle after you\'ve tossed them on the floor. Get in the habit of hanging up your clothes right after you wear them to ensure they\'re ready the next time you want to wear them, too. Know When to Wear Heels and When to Wear Flats : No one looks stylish hobbling down the street in too-high heels. A fashionable woman is also a smart woman \xe2\x80\x94 she stocks her closet with shoes that are as comfortable as they are sophisticated and knows when to pull out the stilettos or rely on a pair of pointed, polished flats._line_Sort Clothes For Laundry and Dry Cleaning : Rather than tossing clothes and forgetting about them, make a habit of sorting your clothes daily. Keep an eye out for spots and stains you can treat immediately, plus pieces that need a trip to the dry cleaners or jeans that might be due for a wash. Sorting them daily means you won\'t be surprised by a hideous stain on your favorite top the next time you\'re looking to wear it. Always Keep a Fashion Emergency Kit Handy : We can prep and prepare all we want to, but sh*t happens. The difference between the most stylish women and the rest of us is just how prepared she is. Keep an emergency kit with a Tide pen, safety pins, Band-Aids, and double-stick tape handy, and you\'ll be ready when blisters, a busted zipper, or snagged hemline strikes. Stay True to Their Personal Style : Chic women never bow to the trends. They keep an arsenal of classic pieces that always flatter and work, despite the season or latest craze \xe2\x80\x94 and it\'s why they always have something to wear._line_'

S' Meerut: A cow vigilante group \xe2\x80\x94 Gau Raksha Seva Samiti \xe2\x80\x94 has threatened large scale protests if the Union home ministry does not take back its direction to close down 39 military farms spread across the country. These farms house 15,000 high-yield Friswall cows, a crossbreed of Holstein cow of Netherlands and Sahiwal of India. The breed was developed jointly by the defence ministry and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) after spending close to Rs 800 crore over a period of 30 years._line_  Last month, the defence ministry had ordered closure of these \xe2\x80\x9closs-making\xe2\x80\x9d military farms and gave ICAR three months to dispose of the cattle, which is close to 25,000 in number._line_  Gau Raksha Seva Samiti\xe2\x80\x99s UP president Abhishek Kaushik said, \xe2\x80\x9cThousands of high-yield cattle are on the verge of being thrown out on the streets. These are costly cows worth at least Rs1 lakh each. Common dairy farmers cannot purchase such expensive animals and hence these cattle will eventually land in slaughterhouses. Besides, thousands of workers employed at these farms will be left jobless. We appeal to the home ministry to take back its order or we will be forced to launch a countrywide agitation.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  Another cow vigilante and the state convenor of Bajrang Dal, Balraj Dungar, said, \xe2\x80\x9cCow is directly linked to Hindutva and the Hindu religion. We are against the idea of disposing of the holy animal. We appeal to the defence ministry to allocate separate land for the continuation of the project as there is massive cost involved in it.\xe2\x80\x9d _line_  Ravindra Sangwan, senior scientist, animal genetics breeding, Central Institute of Research on Cattle (CIRC), a Meerut-based organization under ICAR that had developed the crossbreed, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe order to dispose of the cattle has already been passed. In fact, the defense ministry, through DG, military farms, has advertised the sale of the cattle to central and state government agencies and milk cooperative societies. But no one has shown interest so far. The next step would be an open auction.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  B Prakash, director, ICAR and head, CIRC said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to provide more quality milk for the armed forces and the general public, a massive cross-breeding programme was initiated at Meerut in 1987 after an agreement between the defence ministry and ICAR. The land was provided by the defence ministry at military farms, while technical expertise was provided by ICAR. After intense research and an expenditure of close to Rs 800 crore, the Friswall breed was developed. It had 62.5% genetic strain of Holstein Friesian and 37.5% of Sahiwal.\xe2\x80\x9d _line_'

S' We\'ve cooked up a summer menu to celebrate the cherry in all its glory, from cocktails to barbecue sauce. _line_Recent studies link cherry consumption to relieving the symptoms of gout and arthritis and preventing heart disease. This is thanks to anthocyanins, a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pigment found in the fruit. Tart, unsweetened cherry juice is especially effective, as are cherry capsules and extracts. Whether you want to savor this summer fruit for its sweet flavor or its health benefits, we have seasonal recipes to give you a bit of both._line_Instead of the fluorescent cocktail-cherry garnish, fresh cherries take center stage in this refreshing lemon-and-vodka sipper. Macerating the cherries in sugar helps to soften their thick skins and release their juices, which become gorgeously syrupy in the pan._line_Fresh cherries take the place of tomtatoes in this triple-grain salad. Bulgur, quinoa, and brown rice make for a nutty, wonderfully textured base, though you can omit the bulgur and double the quinoa for a gluten-free version. Extra crunch comes from fresh snap peas and red onion._line_This fruity, boozy take on barbecue has all the characteristics of your favorite sauce\xe2\x80\x94deep caramel notes, a savory backbone, and a pleasant vinegar tang. You can sub sweet cherries for sour, adjusting the amount of honey and vinegar to taste. For a shortcut, start with 1 cup purchased unsweetened cherry juice._line_The meaty texture of fresh cherries holds up in a salsa that goes well with the charred sweet potatoes._line_We like the "naked" look o a couple of tartlets with just a few star cutouts, as sown. If you don\'t, this recipe makes enough dough for each tartlet to have its own pastry lid._line_Creamy and luscious with a touch of tart, this simple fro-yo was a clear staff favorite. A combination of half-and-half, plain whole-milk yogurt, and a little corn syrup gives the frozen yogurt its supersmooth texture._line_'

S' Highlights: _line_The Supreme Court judges unanimously held right of privacy to be part of personal liberty that we enjoy under Article 21 of the constitution._line_This ensures that an individual ought to be free to decide for himself/herself in critical matters without interference from others/state._line_Critical matters include woman\'s freedom to terminate pregnancy, refusal to prolonged medical treatment and food consumption to name a few._line_ The Supreme Court upon hearing several petitions, questioned the government\'s apparent effort to make the unique identification number Aadhaar a must for access to state-sponsored services, taxation and other aspects of regulatory governance. A nine-judge bench was set up headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar to decide whether right to privacy can be declared as a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution. _line_ \xe2\x80\x98An individual\xc2\x92s decision to refuse prolonged treatment, and hence terminate life is a freedom granted by the constitution under the right to privacy.\xe2\x80\x99 _line_ Article 21 of the Indian Constitution: _line_ This section of the constitution secures every Indian citizen of two fundamental rights: _line_Right to life_line_Right to personal liberty_line_ The interpretation of Article 21 has changed over the years to include various rights like the right to know, right to live with human dignity, right to reputation, right against rape, right to healthcare and many more. _line_The petition and the verdict: _line_ The Supreme Court verdict on the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) vs Union of India is a resounding victory for privacy. The ruling is the outcome of a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Indian biometric identity scheme Aadhaar. The nine-judge bench unanimously endorsed the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the right to life and personal liberty of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. _line_ Highlights of the verdict: _line_Right to privacy is a fundamental right: This means that an individual can take decisions on critical matters pertaining to oneself with no interference from others or the State._line_\'Critical matters\' include:_line_ A. Right to refuse prolonged treatment in case of terminally ill patients and hence the right to end life _line_ B. Right and freedom for women to decide on matters related to termination of pregnancy _line_ C. Right to consume food as per individual likes and preferences _line_However the right claimed is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions. The restrictions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis._line_ Justice J Chelameswar made it clear that no legal right, including right to privacy, could be absolute. "Every right has limitations. This aspect of the matter is conceded to at the bar. Therefore, even a fundamental right to privacy has limitations. The limitations are to be identified on a case to case basis depending upon the nature of the privacy interest claimed," he said. _line_The verdict and its implication on Euthanasia or "Mercy Killing" _line_ Euthanasia is termination of life of person who is terminally ill or in a permanent vegetative state. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution clearly provides for living with dignity. A person has a right to live a life with at least minimum dignity and proponents of euthanasia claim that if that standard is falling below that minimum level then a person should be given a right to end his life. _line_Aruna Shanbaug Case: A turning point in Indian legislation: _line_ Aruna was a nurse at KEM Hospital when she was sexually assaulted by a ward boy on the night of November 27, 1993. The attack left Aruna paralyzed and in a vegetative state (irreversible coma). Aruna\'s friend Pinki Virani moved to the Supreme Court with a plea to stop KEM Hospital from force feeding Aruna. In 2011, the Supreme Court sent out a medical team to inspect Aruna\'s condition and a landmark judgment was passed legalizing passive euthanasia in exceptional cases. As per the guidelines passive euthanasia was the withdrawal of food or treatment that would allow the patient to live. However, passive euthanasia is more painful and results in death through agony. _line_Countries that have legalized Euthanasia: _line_ The northern territory of Australia, Albania, Belgium and Netherlands were some of the few countries that legalized either euthanasia or assisted suicide very early on. Canada allows refusal of life sustaining measures but did not legalize euthanasia or assisted killing. _line_What are the implications of the current verdict? _line_ The verdict is not a binding law but it provides a strong argument which can be used when the matter of euthanasia, abortion or related issues are next taken up, either legislatively or in court. This calls for bringing in laws in the Constitution regarding right to end life and also amendments in current laws like the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. _line_ Reference: _line_For the Many and the Few: What a Fundamental Right to Privacy Means for India - (https:thewire.in/170988/right-to-privacy-supreme-court-2)_line_India\'s Abortion Laws Need to Change and in the Pro-Choice Direction - (https:thewire.in/134182/abortion-pregnancy-law-india/)_line_Source: Medindia    _line_'

S'Wang Yi _line_China on Wednesday said Beijing and New Delhi could open a new chapter in their ties, by finding a long-term solution to border friction as seen in Doklam, to help spur the collective rise of Asia._line_Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\xe2\x80\x99s visit to China, following the end of a tense standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in the Sikkim sector, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hoped the two countries \xe2\x80\x9cwill join hands and work together for the rejuvenation of, for the development of our region and contribute our share to the greater development.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_With reference to the Doklam crisis, Mr. Wang said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, with our engagement through a different mechanism, we need to work out a solution in the long run.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Analysts say that Mr. Wang\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a new preventive mechanism, dovetails with calls for establishing a new \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic dialogue\xe2\x80\x9d between the two countries, which is in tune with the current aspirations of the two rising powers, especially in the Asia Pacific and the Indian Ocean._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cThere is huge potential and space for greater cooperation between China and India. And such cooperation serves the interests of the two countries and people\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Wang, during his briefing on the upcoming summit of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) that begins in the Chinese coastal city of Xiamen on September 3._line_However, in response to a question, Mr. Wang counselled India \xe2\x80\x9cto draw lessons from the border incident.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope the Indian side will learn lessons from this incident and prevent similar incidents from happening again.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The Doklam standoff began on June 16, when Indian troops stalled China\xe2\x80\x99s road construction at the disputed tri-junction of China, Bhutan and India, which would have compromised the security of an arterial corridor linking the northeast with the rest of India. _line_Reiterating the fallout of close China-India ties on international stability, Mr. Wang said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope through the efforts from both sides we will maintain a healthy and stable momentum of growth. This is in the interest of not only Indian and Chinese people, but also meets the aspirations of the international community.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Separately, Mr. Wang rubbished the conjecture that the upcoming visit in September to India by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was meant to \xe2\x80\x9ccontain\xe2\x80\x9d China. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Prime Minister Abe needs to seek the opinion of China about the country he is going to visit. Ask Prime Minister Abe about this theory of containing China, and I do not think he is going to say this is his real intention. So I hope our friends in the press will not try to dig up stories that are reported from this perspective.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Mr. Wang pointed out that both India and Japan are China\xe2\x80\x99s neighbours. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we hope that whether it is the Prime Minister of India visiting other countries or the Prime Minister of Japan visiting India, those visits always contribute to international cooperation, in particular increase mutual understanding, solidarity and cooperation among Asian countries.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_'

S'When my son was a year old, a friend who was scrolling through my Facebook photos asked me jokingly (I hope) if my son even recognized me without a camera in front of my face. Every month from his birth to age 1, I had uploaded an entire album of pictures of him wearing a sticker on his shirt that said how many months old he was. There were also photos of him in nearly every new outfit, photos of every hilarious facial expression, and an entire album of pictures of him with vacuum cleaners. (Though in my defense, he really, really loved vacuums.)_line_It\xe2\x80\x99s now four years later, and the number of photos I take has only grown, especially with the addition of my now 2-year-old daughter. I take a lot of pictures of my kids: tiny, everyday moments and milestones that probably don\xe2\x80\x99t count as milestones to anyone but me. (My kids\xe2\x80\x99 first trip to an amusement park was documented with more photos than some weddings.)_line_I regularly order prints of the pictures I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken. They are in frames all over our walls, stuck to the refrigerator with magnets, shoved hastily in boxes, propped up on my dresser, and hanging crookedly on a bulletin board in my son\xe2\x80\x99s room. I periodically stick a few in an envelope and mail them to my kids\xe2\x80\x99 two surviving great-grandparents, some of the only family members who don\xe2\x80\x99t see my near-daily posts on Facebook._line_But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t always do a whole lot with the pictures. Most of them are still in the envelopes they were mailed to me in, put back after I rifled through the stack and removed a few favorites._line_ ( Courtesy of Bethany Neumeyer ) _line_Hopefully someday I\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to scrapbook them or at least put them in albums. For now, though, they mostly serve as an insurance policy against my computer crashing or my phone falling in the toilet._line_Articles I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen floating around social media tell me to put the camera down. Be in the moment. Stop seeing my kids through a camera lens and instead just see them._line_And I get it, I really do. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to be present. To not always be worried about getting the best angle or whether the lighting is right instead of joining in. To not get so focused on capturing memories that you forget to make them. So when my kids and I are playing together, I make a conscious effort to remember to put my phone out of reach and just savor the moment._line_ ( Courtesy of Bethany Neumeyer ) _line_But only after I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a picture or two\xe2\x80\xa6 or five. I don\xe2\x80\x99t always urge them to \xe2\x80\x9cSay cheese!\xe2\x80\x9d I ignore bad lighting and the giant messes that are usually in the background. I take selfies with them on my lap, regardless of my lack of makeup or how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since I last washed my hair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t structure our day around photo sessions or plan activities solely for the purpose of photographing them, and often the photos are a response to my kids asking me to \xe2\x80\x9ctake a picture of us!\xe2\x80\x9d_line_But, yes, I take a lot of pictures of my kids: too many, in some people\xe2\x80\x99s opinion._line_I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone in this. Lots of parents take \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many\xe2\x80\x9d pictures of their kids. My friend and I were watching our children playing together in my backyard when she opened the camera on her phone and looked at me sheepishly. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a total mamarazzi,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, snapping off a few pictures of our kids digging in the dirt before putting her phone back in her pocket._line_ ( Courtesy of Bethany Neumeyer ) _line_Like her, I and other parents who serve as our children\xe2\x80\x99s personal paparazzi often feel like taking so many pictures is something I should be embarrassed about, because the perception is that it\xe2\x80\x99s taking the place of \xe2\x80\x9cbeing in the moment\xe2\x80\x9d with our kids._line_But a study out of Yale University last year found that taking pictures actually adds to one\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with and enjoyment of an experience (as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with the experience, like asking my kids to stop playing so I can photograph them, for example.)_line_ ( Courtesy of Bethany Neumeyer ) _line_In other words, not only are my snapshots of my kids not taking away from my appreciation of the moment, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually helping me to appreciate it more. My kids seem to appreciate it, too. When my son builds a tower out of blocks or finishes a particularly difficult puzzle, he often asks me to photograph him next to it before he takes it apart so that \xe2\x80\x9cwe can remember it forever.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_But most importantly, I know without a doubt that I will never, ever regret having too many pictures of my children. There will not be a day when, sitting in my quiet house after my kids have grown and moved out on their own that I will suddenly think, \xe2\x80\x9cMan, if only I\xe2\x80\x99d taken fewer photos of them when they were little.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Already I look at pictures of them from just a few months ago and do a double take.

S'Sharapova should have the upper hand against Babos. (AFP Photo)_line_ NEW YORK: Fresh off a thrilling victory in front of a sold-out crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday, former world number one Maria Sharapova will look to prove that she has the stamina to back it up when she battles Timea Babos at the US Open on Wednesday. _line_ The 30-year-old Russian looked like her old dominant self in her first Grand Slam match since serving a 15-month doping ban, defeating world number two Simona Halep in three entertaining sets. _line_ The five-time Grand Slam champion fell to her knees after dispatching the Romanian in a match she said she had "no right to win", given her extended absence from the game and her nagging injuries. _line_ Wednesday\'s match will mark the first meeting between Sharapova and 59th-ranked Babos, who was dispatched by Halep in the third round of last year\'s US Open for her best-ever finish at a Grand Slam. _line_ Babos defeated Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in a marathon 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 first round match of her own behind her commanding serve and potent groundstrokes. _line_ Assuming her 6-foot 2-inch frame can recover from Monday\'s classic, the more powerful Sharapova should have the upper hand against the shorter 24-year-old from Hungary. _line_ Sharapova\'s will be the third match of the day in Arthur Ashe Stadium, where Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who has an ongoing lawsuit against the US Tennis Association over a locker room accident in 2015, opens proceedings with a first-round clash with Russian Evgeniya Rodina. _line_ Play on outdoor courts was disrupted by rain on Tuesday, forcing organisers to reshuffle the schedule but Wednesday is expected to be a sunny day at Flushing Meadows. _line_ Former champion and crowd favourite Venus Williams kicks off the later session against France\'s Oceane Dodin. The American won the tournament in 2000 and 2001. _line_ Another former champion, Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, starts his campaign on Arthur Ashe against Swiss Henri Laaksonen. _line_'

S'The PediKlear Difference._line_Cover up our heels... or wear nice footwear?_line_The only thing you need for silky smooth feet._line_PediKlear is a device about 6 inches long and 3 inches across, pick it up and you will notice it\xe2\x80\x99s light but well put together. Within this compact body is housed a powerful battery operated motor. One one end, the device takes 2 AA batteries, and on the other end, away from the handle, is affixed the special Mineral Surface Roller where all the magic happens. Using it is as simple as changing the TV channel, and if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clear up your heels like new, we\xe2\x80\x99ll refund your money and send you a handwritten note of apology._line_But let\xe2\x80\x99s just compare the PediKlear to a common method of tackling cracked heels: pedicures & moisturizers._line_Pedicures are useless if not done regularly. A pedicure is only as effective as the number of times you get it done. It is not a permanent solution. And if your heels are exposed to the pollution, dust and clutter of city life, then you\'re going to need a pedicure a week to keep your heels smooth, gorgeous and crack-free. Missed one session because you\xe2\x80\x99re busy with work, visiting family, or have other commitments? The unsightly cracks are going to come right back._line_With PediKlear, maintaining a routine is extremely easy. The battery operated PediKlear requires no setting up to get started. All you have to do is take off your shoes, press the switch on the PediKlear and apply it to your feet. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, feel free to do this early morning or late at night, or anytime you wish in the entire day. All it takes is two minutes, and you\xe2\x80\x99re done. If you\xe2\x80\x99re travelling, take the compact and lightweight PediKlear with you, and never miss a session._line_Pedicures don\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap. Getting even the most reasonably priced pedicure means a cost of at least Rs. 500/- every time you get one. With a recommended 2 pedicures a month for the average woman (once a week for the on-the-go city woman), maintaining soft, beautiful and crack-free feet comes at a cost of Rs. 12,000/- a year... At a minimum._line_With PediKlear, you buy it once, and you forget about costs. Use as many times as you like, the included rollers will give you 4 months usage each. And replacing them costs 1/10th the price of a pedicure._line_There\xe2\x80\x99s often travel involved. Getting to and from the salon takes work in itself. There\xe2\x80\x99s traffic, there\xe2\x80\x99s waiting and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that you might not always be free before the salon closes, or even opens on the morning. And if the salon close to your home doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do your pedicure the right way, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at an even longer travel time to find someone who does._line_With PediKlear, you don\xe2\x80\x99t ever have to leave your house or wherever you are. No taxis, no walking, no driving, no waiting in traffic, no waiting at the salon, no waiting while your feet soak in the water. Just pure performance, right from when you switch it on._line_PediKlear - a simple and elegant solution._line_Home pedicures take time. But what if you\xe2\x80\x99re considering doing all of your pedicures at home? Know that you have to have time on your hands to make it happen. First, the water has to be heated. Then you soak your feet until the cracks, rough and callused skin lose some of their hardness. Then, you pick up a pumice stone and get to work..._line_With PediKlear, all you have to do is switch the device on, use it on all the parts of your foot that have cracks, calluses, and hardness, and watch the device do its magic in under 2 minutes. Then switch off the device, dust off your feet and you\xe2\x80\x99re done. Before the water has even become warm._line_Home pedicures take effort. Putting water in a tub or bucket and soaking your feet is the easy part. What really gets tiring is the fact that you have to take a pumice stone, or scraper or any similar tool and rub away at the cracks - and this is not going to happen in just a few minutes. If you misjudge how long you have to soak your feet, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to scrub for a long time without seeing any results. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not to talk about how much the arms hurt from all scrubbing!_line_With PediKlear, there are no such aches and pains. It\xe2\x80\x99s high-watt motor ensures that with a gentle press to the affected areas of the feet, the cracked skin gets blasted off, leaving only smooth, soft and clean skin in its place. No scraping or rubbing required._line_Not all pedicures are safe. The problem with scrubbers shavers and scrapers is that they are pretty much a stone-age technology, and that means we cannot always control their effect. Scrub too hard, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave your heels feeling raw and painful, so much so that walking will become a problem. Scrapers and shavers have their own issues, make cuts too deep, and you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at extremely painful, sensitive and possibly infected skin. On the part of the body you need the most to even go and get a glass of water._line_With PediKlear, there is no question of such problems arising. PediKlear is the safest way to get the most beautiful feet, with its specially formulated Mineral Surface Roller that makes only external contact and removes cracks, calluses and hard skin in front of your own eyes. No side effects, guaranteed. PediKlear is also CE certified which means it is complaint for sale in the European market._line_Pedicures aren\xe2\x80\x99t portable. Getting a pedicure at your favorite salon or at home is one thing, but what if you\xe2\x80\x99re staying in a hotel? Or at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. Or away for a family function? Setting up a pedicure takes time, equipment and space - one or more of these things is often not available to us._line_With PediKlear, all you have to do is take the device and use it on your feet, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll always have soft, smooth and crack-free feet. There is no step 2. No matter which city, state or country you\xe2\x80\x99re in._line_Quality is not assured each time. With pedicures, guaranteeing the quality is not always possible. You may have a favorite salon, but if your favorite beautician isn\xe2\x80\x99t available on the day, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to explain just the way you like to get things done - and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. If you\xe2\x80\x99re away from your preferred salon (or away from home), then results will always be a mixed bag. You may get a great pedicure, or you may have spent a few hundred rupees with nothing much in return._line_With PediKlear, you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting each time - great looking, soft and crack-free feet in just a matter of minutes._line_What about moisturizers? Do they work? Of course. But..._line_You see that really rough skin and cracks around the feet? Even the most effective and expensive moisturizer isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get through that skin and have a lasting effect. For moisturizers to be effective, you must first get rid of the cracks! Not the other way round._line_Alright, That Sounds Pretty Great! How Does It Work?_line_It\xe2\x80\x99s simple. And genius._line_The hardened Mineral Surface Roller on the PediKlear directly attacks the most important problem keeping you from beautiful and soft feet - the cracks._line_Dimensions and components of PediKlear_line_When the rotating Mineral Surface Roller makes contact with the skin on your heels and feet, it\xe2\x80\x99s specially formulated surface offers 5x the resistance of an ordinary pumice stone, thereby giving much better effectiveness against even the deepest cracks, hardest skin and hardened calluses._line_No matter how deep or dark the cracks, the only way to recover smoothness and beautiful feet is to directly remove the dead, rough, hard, discolored skin. That\xe2\x80\x99s what PediKlear does, and thus, right before your eyes, your skin becomes soft and super smooth._line_In fact, we urge you to see for yourself the astonishing results offered by PediKlear._line_ Go out and buy the most expensive foot crack cream in the market, and pick a salon of your choice - where the treatment is as effective as the pampering. Give yourself a glorious pedicure treatment once or twice a week, and note the results this has on your heels, and how they look and feel after 2 weeks\xe2\x80\x99 treatment._line_Now compare with PediKlear: Just 3 days usage - a total of not more than 10 minutes - and the application of a basic moisturizing agent: coconut oil, vaseline, or any cream based lotion. All done within the comfort of your own home, at the time of your choosing, and with nothing else than your own hands, and of course, your PediKlear._line_The difference, as you will notice, is night and day. With PediKlear, every time you use the product, the dry and callused skin at the base of your heels will be vaporized, and smooth soft and supple skin will readily absorb any moisturizing agent you use - keeping heels feeling soft and looking great. Whereas with the pedicure, no matter how expensive your foot cream, the cracks themselves will begin to reappear just a few hours after your pedicure, especially if you leave your home and expose your feet to the outside elements. The only cure? Another long, time-taking and not-so-cheap \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d at the hands of a beautician._line_Gorgeous Footwear: A PediKlear Side-Effect!_line_PediKlear is 100% safe to use. In fact, it is leaps and bounds better than using scrapers, shavers or any chemicals that may have adverse affects on your heels - making the skin raw, painful, inflamed and even causing infection._line_That means PediKlear has no side-effects\xe2\x80\xa6 except one: Enabling you to wear your favorite footwear better than ever before!_line_Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it works. Suppose you use PediKlear for a year. You will have gorgeous and smooth-to-touch feet at all times - with just a few minutes of your time, and a few rupees for every time you use it._line_On the other hand, with the going rate of Rs. 500 per pedicure, and just 2 pedicures a month, your foot-care costs could run up to Rs. 12,000 a year or even higher! Save that money, and you have another reason to go shopping for your favorite thing - shoes!_line_Waterproofing! The PediKlear Difference_line_PediKlear - Waterproof and works on Wet Skin_line_One of the most convenient lifestyle features of PediKlear is the fact that it is waterproof. And this has two distinct meanings:_line_One: Use it in the bathroom, without any fear of getting the device wet._line_Two: Use it ON WET FEET, and the effectiveness remains excellent. That is to say, it works perfectly. So use it after showering, use it right after soaking your feet, use it after you have moisturized and\xe2\x80\xa6 use it, wipe your feet and use it again! The PediKlear will still deliver stunning results._line_\xe2\x80\x9cApproved And Recommended By Experts\xe2\x80\x9d_line_I came across PediKlear online and picked one up for my wife who was complaining about the rough skin and cracks on her feet.

S'This week is perfect to zoom your lens on Bappa, using these handy tips from avid photographers_line_Picture this: The air is tinged with hues of red, yellow and green as colours are splashed everywhere. Thousands of devotees fill the streets with chants of Ganpati Bappa Morya, dwarfed by giant idols that make their way to the city\'s beaches for immersion. If you\'re keen to frame this scene for posterity, join this Ganpati Visarjan photowalk._line_To be conducted by Prerna Kale and Hitesh Baldota, members of Facebook group MumbaiOgraphy, the walk begins in Dadar West and moves to Shivaji Park, where you can take candid shots under their guidance. "We chose to host the walk on the fifth day because the crowds are still manageable. This will be helpful for women photographers," says Baldota. Carry a DSLR or a point-and-shoot camera. While a 35mm or 50mm prime lens is ideal, you can also carry 18-55 or 55-200mm lens._line_On September 1_line_Time 5 pm onwards_line_Meeting pont Plaza Cinema, Dadar West._line_Call 9975198449_line_\'Find an angle no one else has\'_line_It\'s important to try and innovate when it comes to visarjan pictures, because it\'s likely that the frame you\'ve clicked is the same one that 50 others have. In 1991, when all the photojournalists I knew were waiting at Girgaum Chowpatty to take pictures of the idols being immersed, I got on a fisherman\'s boat and asked him to take me out to a spot in the sea from where I could capture the visarjan._line_The resultant shot stood out from the rest in the next day\'s paper.

The crowd has a tendency to get wild, and you don\'t want to fall victim to their euphoria-driven antics. I remember a girl once carried a camera worth around R7 lakh, belonging to the college where she was studying, thinking it would help her get better pictures. Instead, thanks to the crowd, the camera was destroyed. So, if you\'re looking to be close to all the action, it\'s better to go in with inexpensive equipment._line_Mukesh Parpiani, former photojournalist and head of photography at Piramal Gallery_line_\'Don\'t use a flash\'_line_If you\'re shooting the visarjan late in the evening, avoid using a flash while taking pictures. You will miss out on capturing the mood if you do. Instead, play around with the ISO and exposure settings on your camera, and make as much use of the light available to you._line_For instance, the halogen street lights at Girgaum Chowpatty, although not too bright, will go a long way in adding character to your images._line_Vishal Patil_line_\'Decide on a narrative\'_line_Even before you step into the visarjan, create a storyboard in your head \xe2\x80\x94 do you want to shoot a compilation of idols, or create a photo-story with the idols and devotees in the background? If it is the former, you can stand at a distance and take straight, clean shots of five or 10 idols. However, if you want to capture the movement, you need to get into the crowd and move around._line_\'Carry one set of lens\'_line_Due to the excessive crowds, photographers avoid carrying extra lens.

S'A newly defined "stress survival islet" asures survival of some listeria strains despite high hygiene standards in food production. Credit: Institute of Milk Hygiene/Vetmeduni Vienna_line_Despite the high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in the food industry, bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes can still be found in the food processing environment. In a study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, a team of researchers from Vetmeduni Vienna has now shown that certain Listeria strains \xe2\x80\x93 figuratively speaking \xe2\x80\x93 take refuge on an island. An "islet" of two genes located in one area of the genome increases the bacteria\'s survival under alkaline and oxidative stress conditions. The researchers were able to identify the two genes as a functional unit termed a "stress survival islet". Understanding this genetic "lifesaver" can help develop new strategies for food safety. _line_Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that colonizes and reproduces on diverse food products including cheese or meat. Without proper food hygiene, it represents a health risk. The hygiene standards in food production chains, therefore, are quite high. But Listeria is known for its ability to survive in environmental niches in which other microorganisms cannot._line_The key to the bacteria\'s survival is its adaptability and persistence in stress situations. Certain genetic mechanisms allow L. monocytogenes to react to and block the effects of cleaning solutions and disinfectants. Researchers from the Institute of Milk Hygiene were able to decipher this function for two of the food pathogen\'s genes. They showed that these genes form a functional unit that ensures the bacteria\'s survival despite the hygiene standards in the food production industry._line_Hypervariable regions of the genome help Listeria to survive stress_line_Hypervariable, i.e. easily changeable, regions of the genome contain genetic inserts that help Listeria survive. "These inserts include a unit of gene sequences, the stress survival islet 1 (SSI-1), a \'genomic island\' that helps the microorganisms to survive certain stress situations," explains first author Eva Harter. "Depending on the specific bacterial strain, this region accommodates one of three different gene sequences whose function, with the exception of SSI-1, had so far not been known."_line_The genes in the stress survival islet 1 confer the bacteria a high tolerance toward acidic, bile, salt and gastric stresses and were characterized years ago. This does not explain how the bacteria can survive the hygiene standards in the food processing industry, however, which involves different, namely alkaline and oxidative, stress situations for Listeria. The researchers therefore concentrated on two neighbouring gene sequences within the same hypervariable region and were able to identify these as the genomic islet that acts as a lifesaver for certain Listeria monocytogenes strains in these situations._line_New stress survival factors characterized for the foodborne pathogen L. monocytogenes_line_The expression of the two genes and of the proteins which they code is increased during alkaline and oxidative stress. They must therefore have a different function than the genes belonging to the SSI-1. "We were able to assign a function to the two genes. The first gene is a transcriptional regulator, which in certain situations regulates the frequency and activity of the second protein. The second is a protease, an enzyme that breaks down other proteins. Proteases help bacteria break down unfunctional proteins that are created during stress situations," says Harter._line_"If the regulator is not active, then there is no protease. Without the protease, Listeria monocytogenes has a harder time compensating oxidative stress. The two genes therefore make up a functional unit, specifically the stress survival islet SSI-2," says study director Kathrin Rychli. This islet is predominantly found in L. monocytogenes strains that are specialised for food and food processing environments._line_Specific to the food niche_line_"We were able to identify a specific genome type in which the SSI-2 sequence is always present," explains Rychli. "This sequence type, ST121, is found almost exclusively in food and the food processing environment and hardly ever in clinical isolates. In strains forming part of the ST121 group, SSI-2 is highly conserved i.e. completely identical." SSI-2 thus appears to be niche-specific. Most Listeria strains found in clinical isolates do not have SSI-2." Through the discovery of the new stress survival island, the researchers, with project funding provided by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), were able to describe an important survival strategy of foodborne Listeria. "Knowing the genetic mechanism, allows you to think about new strategies for food safety," says Rychli. _line_More information: Eva Harter et al.

S' Director of Education (University and Higher Education) Building in Imphal in March 2013 :: Pix - Deepak Oinam _line_Grant of Trained /Sr /Selection Grade scale: A team at Directorate led by a Senior Finance Officer has been working on war-footing mode for granting of Trained /Sr /Selection Grade scale to eligible teachers. There are bottlenecks as it involves pre-audits by Local Fund Department and subsequent concurrence of the Finance Department. Department is taking all necessary steps to institutionalize a more expeditious process to address this area of serious grievance in consultation with FD. _line_Academic Calendar: We were taken by surprise that Govt, schools are operating without an Academic Calendar. In the absence of a holistic academic calendar which is applicable to all the schools in the State, the timing and schedule of admission, vacation, and examination are at the whim of the individual school concerned leading to confusion and lack of co-ordination. _line_ To fix this issue, the Department has recently constituted a Committee represented by all stakeholders to develop a holistic Academic Calendar which will be applicable to all schools. The Academic Calendar will also prescribe a common time for serving of mid-day meals in all schools to facilitate inspection by the Department officials. _line_Inspection system: When we joined the Department, inspection system was in the cold storage. We decided that it had to be revived. In our monthly staff meetings with our ZEOs and Principals, the modalities of the Inspection system were discussed. An agreed upon Inspection template finally emerged and was circulated to all the ZEOs, DIs and Als and they have started visiting the schools to check not merely the attendance of students and teachers but also implementation of Mid-Day Meal Scheme, SSA & RMSA. Inspection reports have started to come in and they are being analyzed for follow-up action. _line_Convergence of Education(S) and SSA/ RMSA: It is now more convenient that the Director of Education(S) is also the State Project Director of SSA and RMSA. There has been a convergence of all the activities of the Directorate of Education(S) and these flagship programmes. The earlier problem of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing is gradually narrowing. _line_ (The SPD of SSA and RMSA will now take over the authorship of this article momentarily to place a brief report on SSA and RMSA in the following paras, after which we will pool our pens again for a final conclusion). _line_BUDGET FOR SSA AND ACHIEVEMENTS_line_ (Not reflected in the State Budgetary outlay for the Department) _line_ Some of the achievements are:_line_ a. 335 new primary schools were opened._line_ b. Further, 380 Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) were upgraded to primary schools and 76 are under process._line_ c. 11 KGVBs and 9 Residential Schools are being opened. Construction works of most have begun and are in various stages of progress. _line_ d. 258 primary schools were upgraded to upper primary schools. _line_ e. 1951 Primary Teachers & 574 Upper Teachers were recruited. _line_ f. There are plans to construct New Primary School, New Upper Primary School, Additional Classrooms and Ramps with Handrails. _line_ g. However due to court cases, construction works have been halted. Govt, has moved the Hon\'ble High Court and the Court\'s Order has been revoked less than a week back. All activities will now resume with renewed zeal. _line_BUDGET FOR RMSA AND ACHIEVEMENTS_line_ (Not reflected in the State Budgetary outlay for the Department) _line_ Budget Proposal for RMSA in respect of Manipur was placed before the PAB of MHRD on 12th June, 2013 for its consideration and the outcome is awaited. Some achievements are given below: _line_ a. 202 Additional Classrooms, 167 Integrated Science Labs, 165 Computer Rooms, 95 Library Rooms, 224 Art and Craft Rooms and 224 Toilet Blocks have been constructed. _line_ b. Construction of 296 Teachers Quarters are in progress in 76 Govt. Secondary Schools. _line_ c. 116 Junior High Schools were upgraded to High Schools. _line_ d. 492 Trained Graduate Teachers were recruited. _line_ e. Recruitment of another 338 trained Graduate teachers is in final stage. _line_Conclusion _line_ Coming back, we would like to wrap this article on a positive and motivational note. George Bernard Shaw once wrote, "You see things/and you say \'Why?\' But I dream things that never were; and I say \'Why not?" This is exactly the attitude we will like to cultivate in the Department to achieve our goals and realise its vision. _line_ Having said that, our final thoughts and perspective are in order, which is that:_line_ It all boils down to EXECUTION_line_ a) Whatever grandeur plans, vision and roadmap we may dream up, without execution, they will just remain what they are: dreams._line_ b) In order for the dreams to take wings and translate into reality, we need to prioritise the steps leading to our ultimate goal._line_ c) Clear steps for execution should be defined and we should be able to answer the following questions:_line_ Who will do it?_line_ When?_line_ How?_line_ Where will the fund (if required) come from?_line_ When to monitor and by whom? _line_ Allow us to let Walt Disney pitch in for us:_line_ "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them"._line_ We would like to add that we peddle not just bubble dreams and courage, we also do have a plan and are working on it._line_ We will update you in the next issue. Till then, happy reading! _line_'

S'A spacecraft has uncovered in lunar soil some traces of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ancient atmosphere that werekey to the development of complex life_line_A Japanese spacecraft orbiting the moon recently made a surprising find: oxygen that came from Earth. Scientists think this oxygen could provide a historical rec\xc2\xadord of our planet\xe2\x80\x99s ancient atmosphere._line_Few reliable clues exist as to the early history of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and rocky surface because geologic activity has erased detailed evidence over time. Also wiped out are snapshot details that could be gleaned from meteorites made of material that formed around the same time and from similar material as Earth._line_The discovery of terrestrial oxygen on the moon now suggests another way to get at the atmospheric history of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s first two billion years. The moon is constantly bombarded by a stream of highly charged particles emanating from the sun, called the solar wind. But for five days about every month our lunar neighbor is shielded by Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere\xe2\x80\x94a bubblelike region where the planet\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field dominates. During this time, a window opens for slower oxygen ions from Earth to arrive at the moon. Scientists believe that these ions, which the SELENE spacecraft (better known as Kaguya) detected, drifted over geologic time from the outer layers of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and became embedded in the moon\xe2\x80\x99s regolith, a loose top layer of soil and rock. A team led by planetary scientist Kentaro Terada of Osaka University in Japan reported the result earlier this year in Nature Astronomy. \xe2\x80\x9cOur new finding is a direct link that ions from Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere are transported to the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d where they could remain in the lunar soils for billions of years, Terada says._line_This result excites scientists interested in a transition coinciding with the beginnings of photosynthesis in simple microbes, the planet\xe2\x80\x99s primeval life-forms. Somewhere around 2.45 billion years ago Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere changed from oxygen-poor to oxygen-rich under still mysterious circumstances that scientists call the Great Oxidation Event. Could some of the atmospheric oxygen produced at that time linger on the moon today? If scientists can collect and analyze samples of the terrestrial oxygen embedded in lunar soil, it could provide insights into how Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere has evolved over the eons._line_In addition to trapped oxygen, the moon may harbor a trove of other evolutionary information about primordial Earth. \xe2\x80\x9cIn principle, the moon has this remarkable collection of detritus from its sister planet,\xe2\x80\x9d says astrobiologist Caleb Scharf of Columbia University, who was not involved in the new research. And that detritus might carry even more intriguing data. He adds: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not inconceivable that there are fossil organisms in Earth meteorites on the lunar surface.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_'

I had previously reviewed \xe2\x80\x9cPink Precious.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s the turn of the shade \xe2\x80\x9cSandstone.\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started with the review now!_line_Price:_line_ INR 675_line_ Product Description:_line_My Experience with Lotus Makeup Ecostay Butter Matte Lip Color Sandstone:_line_This lipstick comes in a silver cardboard packaging with purple accents to it. The box has matte finish to it and a lot of details are printed on the box. The actual lipstick is a shiny silver chubby bullet with some purple floral print on the cap. The twist mechanism works very well. The top part of the cap is made of plastic so you can see the shade inside. The packaging is beautiful and I love it._line_\xe2\x80\x9cBM 09 Sandstone\xe2\x80\x9d is the kind of shade that I never knew I would like, let alone love so much! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a n*de lipstick kind of girl. It was all about bright and bold shades for me, but this little baby changed the lipstick game for me. \xe2\x80\x9cSandstone\xe2\x80\x9d is such a beautiful rust orange n*de brown shade! It is the most gorgeous lip shade ever! I have been reaching this lipstick so often that I have kind of forgotten to use my brighter lipsticks!_line_This is the second n*de lipstick that I\xe2\x80\x99m obsessed with (the first one being \xe2\x80\x98N*de Shine\xe2\x80\x99 again by Lotus Herbals). These two are the best n*de lipsticks out there that would suit all skin tones. The texture is simply mind blowing! It literally glides on like butter on the lips! Plus, it is extremely pigmented. It claims to give full pigmentation with one stroke but I\xe2\x80\x99d say, it gives about 90% of the pigmentation. You only need two coats for 100% pigmented lips._line_The formula is moisturizing and feels very comfortable on the lips. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% matte, but a creamy matte finish. The lipstick initially gives a creamy finish, but as time passes by, it settles into a creamy matte finish. I just love how comfortable it is to wear! You don\xe2\x80\x99t need a lip balm underneath at all._line_The staying power is around 5 hours. It does fade from the inner part of your lips after a meal, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It does last through the talking and little meals pretty well though._line_Pros of Lotus Makeup Ecostay Butter Matte Lip Color Sandstone:_line_Love the packaging._line_Easy to apply._line_The shade is unique and gorgeous!_line_Very pigmented._line_Super creamy texture._line_Glides on like a dream!_line_Feels very comfortable on the lips._line_Good staying power._line_Cons of Lotus Makeup Ecostay Butter Matte Lip Color Sandstone:_line_IMBB Rating:_line_ 4.8/5_line_ Would I Recommend/Repurchase Lotus Makeup Ecostay Butter Matte Lip Color Sandstone?_line_ Yes! Definitely! This and \xe2\x80\x98Nude Shine\xe2\x80\x99 and two of my most favorite n*de lipsticks ever!_line_ Overall rating:   0  out of 5 based on  0  reviews.  _line_'

S' NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh\'s flood woes continued as the death toll rose to 103 on Wednesday while the situation improved further in Bihar with water receding from several areas and no report of any deaths. _line_ The flood situation in Assam and West Bengal too improved significantly and the number of deluge-hit people went down. _line_ Torrential rains and subsequent flooding claimed at least 10 lives in Mumbai and the neighbouring districts of Palghar and Thane since Tuesday. _line_ Nine people were washed away in separate incidents in the city, while two lost their lives due to drowning in adjoining districts of Palghar and Thane. Another man was killed when a wall came crashing down on him in Mumbai\'s Ghatkopar. _line_ The toll in flood-related incidents in Bihar remained unchanged at 514 and people have started returning to their homes as the waters are receding. _line_ Though 116 relief camps continued to operate, the number of people staying in them dwindled to 61,495 as compared to 1.38 lakh on Tuesday, a state Disaster Management Department report said. _line_ However in Uttar Pradesh, over 27 lakh people were affected by the deluge in the eastern parts of the state as raging waters of rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of land. _line_ Citing a report compiled till Tuesday, the relief commissioner\'s office here said around 60,000 people have taken shelter in relief camps in the affected districts. _line_ "The toll in the floods has reached 103 in the state, where 3,133 villages in 24 districts are inundated," it said. _line_ Army choppers, NDRF and PAC (flood) personnel continued relief and rescue operations round the clock in the severely affected areas of the flood-hit districts of the state. _line_ The flood situation in Assam continued to improve as the number of deluge-hit people in the state has gone down to around 79,000 in five districts against yesterday\'s figure of over one lakh. _line_ The third wave of the devastating flood has so far claimed 74 lives in the state. The total number of people losing their lives in this year\'s flood-related incidents stood at 158. _line_ Currently, 217 villages and nearly 10,500 hectares of crop areas are still inundated, the Assam Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said. _line_ Authorities are running 45 relief camps and distribution centres in four districts, where 14,117 people have taken shelter, it said. _line_ West Bengal, which is yet to fully recover from the floods triggered by torrential downpour, is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places of sub-Himalayan parts of the state till tomorrow. _line_ Meanwhile, the flood situation in the six districts of northern West Bengal was improving with no major rainfall reported from anywhere in the area. _line_ So far, floods have claimed 152 lives in the 11 districts of northern and southern parts of the state while over 10 lakh acre of agricultural land was inundated. _line_ "The total loss has been estimated at around Rs 14,000 crore," Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said. _line_'

S' (Natural News) It won\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise to most people that Omega-3 fatty acids like those found in fatty fish are good for your health, but a new study revealing just how these important acids fight inflammation shows they might be even more beneficial than believed. It turns out they work their magic by activating the self-cleaning process in certain types of immune cells._line_Omega-3 fatty acids have long been known to help reduce inflammatory reactions. While some inflammation can help fight against infections, inflammatory reactions that are too strong or that occur even when there are no viruses or bacteria can be very harmful._line_Immune cells found in your body\xe2\x80\x99s tissues and organs known as macrophages play a vital role in managing your body\xe2\x80\x99s inflammatory reactions. Autophagy occurs when unnecessary or dysfunctional proteins and other cell components essentially eat themselves so your body can get rid of them, and scientists are increasingly discovering that it is a crucial process when it comes to your health. It is constantly occurring in cells, and it is heightened when cells become injured or starve. Scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) set out to determine whether omega-3 fatty acids were able to dampen inflammation by elevating the autophagy process in macrophages._line_To test their theory, they studied macrophages that had been isolated from humans and mice. They discovered that while these acids did indeed dampen many of the inflammatory mechanisms in macrophages, there was one that they reduced in particular: The type 1 interferon response. Macrophages secrete something known as factor CXCL-10 as part of the type 1 interferon response in the presence of certain types of stimuli._line_They then took a look at blood samples taken from a clinical study of patients who had been given cardiac transplants. They knew that supplementing with omega-3 had improved these patients\xe2\x80\x99 clinical status, and they discovered that omega-3 fatty acids had decreased their CXCL-10 levels._line_Omega-3 can help conditions like cancer, MS, meningitis and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s_line_Essentially, this means that autophagy changes within macrophages as a response to omega-3 and reduces the secretion of inflammatory factors related to interferon response, especially CXCL-10. Therefore, they concluded that supplements of omega-3 fatty acids can help patients with conditions that are aggravated or caused by CXCL-10 and strong interferon responses, such as multiple sclerosis, meningitis, jaundice, Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease, and many types of cancer. The researchers emphasize, however, that more research needs to be carried out._line_Another recent study, this one out of Aberdeen University, found that a diet rich in omega-3 can boost a person\xe2\x80\x99s odds of surviving colorectal cancer and stop deadly tumors from spreading throughout the body. They discovered that people with the highest proportion of omega-3 metabolizing enzymes in relation to omega-6 had the best survival chances and the least tumor spread. Other studies have shown that it has a similar effect on prostate cancer._line_Omega-3s have been the subject of lots of research recently, with another study released a few weeks ago showing that these essential fatty acids can help treat the early stages of Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. Although omega-3 has long been linked to brain health, this particular study was good news for the many people caught in the midst of the Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s epidemic hitting the nation._line_How to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids_line_You can find omega-3s in fatty fish like salmon, trout, sardines, tuna, swordfish and mackerel. Chia seeds, spinach, flaxseed oil and walnuts are also good sources of omega-3. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough omega 3 from your diet, supplements can help make up the difference._line_'

S"Summary_line_Auto sales in the U.S. have dropped for the second year consecutively._line_GM underperformed the market. However, its performance was better than Ford's._line_Hurricane Harvey's damage is not significant enough to boost GM sales in coming months._line_Automotive sales in the U.S. are meager for the second year straight. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, total auto sales declined by 15% in July 2017 compared to the same month a year ago. Domestic auto sales fell by 13.2% and import auto sales declined by 20%. General Motors (NYSE: GM) is feeling the weakening demand for vehicles in the U.S. and I believe that GM is in trouble going forward._line_Why do I believe that GM is in trouble?_line_Let us take a look at the deliveries for July 2017. Since GM reports auto sales and light truck sales combined, we should delve into the total vehicle sales in the U.S. For July 2017, U.S. total vehicle sales dropped by 9%. Meanwhile, GM's vehicle sales fell by 15.4%. The drop was mainly due to lackluster demand for Buick and Cadillac._line_What is more is that there are no signs of trend reversal regarding demand for these brands. I can see two tailwinds for the domestic auto industry, but I believe they are not strong enough to reverse the trend. Let us delve further into each of Chevrolet's brands and models._line_General Motors deliveries for July 2017_line_Buick_line_On the positive aspect, deliveries for Buick Envision almost doubled from 1,421 to 2,812, for its best July ever. On the negative side is every other model. Deliveries for Buick Verano dropped by 93.4% from 2,068 to 136. Overall, deliveries for Buick dropped a whopping 30.5%. Buick is sailing in rough waters and the management needs to do something urgently._line_Cadillac_line_Sales of Cadillac dropped by 21.7% for July on a YOY basis. Sales of the Cadillac XT5 improved by 11%. However, sales of the ATS and CTS model dropped by 63% and 40%, respectively. One aspect that could improve sales in the interim is the fact that the euro is appreciating substantially against the dollar, making imports more expensive. Therefore, competition against Audi and Mercedes-Benz should decline._line_Chevrolet_line_GM\xe2\x80\x99s primary segment had mixed numbers. On the one hand, the Chevrolet Colorado saw a 21% increase in deliveries, far outpacing the U.S. light truck sales. Moreover, deliveries for Equinox rose 7.5% to 23,524 units._line_On the other hand, the demand for small cars such as the Spark and the Sonic dried up, and deliveries declined by 47.3% and 81.9%, respectively. Overall, Chevrolet reports a decline of 15.3% in deliveries,slightly underperforming the market. However, the shrinkage in deliveries is narrower when compared to Ford (NYSE:F)._line_GMC_line_The best performance came from GMC last month, largely aided by a 30% boost in Acadia deliveries and a stunning 188% increase in Savana deliveries. The GMC Terrain was the worst performer with deliveries declining by 39%. Overall, the segment reported a 7.3% decline in deliveries._line_Possible headwinds?_line_King dollar_line_One possible tailwind for the industry is that the dollar is weakening against other currencies. Over the last three months, the euro has appreciated by 13% with respect to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, GM may be a cheaper option for consumers as opposed to European cars. Investors need to keep an open eye on the management's comments regarding currency._line_Harvey_line_First, my prayers and thoughts to everybody in Houston. Long live Texas. Investors suggested in a previous article that Harvey caused severe damage and people will need new vehicles. Therefore, vehicle sales should increase in coming months. I agree with that fact to a certain extent. However, being a believer of the efficient market hypothesis in the semi-weak form, I believe that the small increase in auto sales due to Harvey is already priced in. I feel that the market does not consider that auto sales will increase significantly as the GM's share price has remained relatively unchanged._line_My two cents_line_The automobile sales in the U.S. are under pressure and there are no catalysts in sight that will reverse the trend. Furthermore, GM continues to underperform U.S. sales. Therefore, until GM outperforms the market, the safest option is to avoid investing in General Motors._line_Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours._line_I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article._line_"

S' MUMBAI: Mumbai University is set to miss one more deadline to complete the assessment work, as was promised in the Bombay High Court. Close to 85,000 answersheets of exams conducted by the Mumbai University are yet to be assessed, even as the deadline for postgraduate admissions concludes on Thursday. August 31 was the last date to fill the admission forms for the three-year law programme, as well as the last date to submit marksheets to confirm MBA/MMS, M Tech, MCA and other professional admissions. _line_ While the university has managed to announce the TYB Com results, the exam which is taken by the highest number of candidates, results of many students are held back. The university held back the results of close to 10,000 TYB Com students, and many have been marked absent in their exams. Similarly, students from TYBA, engineering and law have been marked absent in one or more papers or they received a message stating that their results will be declared later. The helpdesk at the university, which was primarily set up to help students seeking admissions in foreign universities, is now getting inquiries from students who were marked absent or whose results were to be declared later, said the official. He added that such results will be declared within 10 days. On Wednesday more results were announced, but students were unable to access the website. Several TYB Com students are yet to access their results due to the glitch, even as their results were declared on Sunday night. _line_  The deadline for centralised law admissions in state has been extended for almost a month to accommodate students from the university, on the direction of the state government. "We have already extended it several times. It may be difficult for us to extend it further. We will take a decision on Thursday. Students who are yet to get their results probably can join the process from the second round," said state\'s CET cell commissioner, Chandrashekhar Oak. Other post-graduate admissions, though are already done on the basis of the entrance test scores, require marksheets to confirm it. "The deadline of courses such as MBA/MMS was decided by a Supreme Court order and I am bound by it," added Oak. _line_ A festive weekend followed by torrential rains in the city derailed the assessment process to some extent as only about 5,000 papers were getting assessed over the last seven days. On Tuesday, 6,822 papers were assessed by 146 teachers, and on Wednesday, 5,265 papers were assessed by 112 teachers. Many of the teachers who contributed in the assessment work on these two days are likely to be from other universities, said an official, as Mumbai was submerged under water. _line_ In a press conference on Wednesday, the ABVP demanded resignation of the vice-chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh and also sought a judiciary inquiry into the contract signed between the university and MeritTrac. They also wanted the government to appoint permanent officers in the university, as most important posts are currently holding additional charge. _line_'

S'Credit: CC0 Public Domain_line_Researchers from the Department of Energy\'s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have for the first time shown that neural networks - a form of artificial intelligence - can accurately analyze the complex distortions in spacetime known as gravitational lenses 10 million times faster than traditional methods. _line_"Analyses that typically take weeks to months to complete, that require the input of experts and that are computationally demanding, can be done by neural nets within a fraction of a second, in a fully automated way and, in principle, on a cell phone\'s computer chip," said postdoctoral fellow Laurence Perreault Levasseur, a co-author of a study published today in Nature._line_Lightning Fast Complex Analysis_line_The team at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC), a joint institute of SLAC and Stanford, used neural networks to analyze images of strong gravitational lensing, where the image of a faraway galaxy is multiplied and distorted into rings and arcs by the gravity of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, that\'s closer to us. The distortions provide important clues about how mass is distributed in space and how that distribution changes over time - properties linked to invisible dark matter that makes up 85 percent of all matter in the universe and to dark energy that\'s accelerating the expansion of the universe._line_Until now this type of analysis has been a tedious process that involves comparing actual images of lenses with a large number of computer simulations of mathematical lensing models. This can take weeks to months for a single lens._line_But with the neural networks, the researchers were able to do the same analysis in a few seconds, which they demonstrated using real images from NASA\'s Hubble Space Telescope and simulated ones._line_To train the neural networks in what to look for, the researchers showed them about half a million simulated images of gravitational lenses for about a day. Once trained, the networks were able to analyze new lenses almost instantaneously with a precision that was comparable to traditional analysis methods. In a separate paper, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the team reports how these networks can also determine the uncertainties of their analyses._line_Prepared for Data Floods of the Future_line_"The neural networks we tested - three publicly available neural nets and one that we developed ourselves - were able to determine the properties of each lens, including how its mass was distributed and how much it magnified the image of the background galaxy," said the study\'s lead author Yashar Hezaveh, a NASA Hubble postdoctoral fellow at KIPAC._line_This goes far beyond recent applications of neural networks in astrophysics, which were limited to solving classification problems, such as determining whether an image shows a gravitational lens or not._line_The ability to sift through large amounts of data and perform complex analyses very quickly and in a fully automated fashion could transform astrophysics in a way that is much needed for future sky surveys that will look deeper into the universe - and produce more data - than ever before._line_The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), for example, whose 3.2-gigapixel camera is currently under construction at SLAC, will provide unparalleled views of the universe and is expected to increase the number of known strong gravitational lenses from a few hundred today to tens of thousands._line_"We won\'t have enough people to analyze all these data in a timely manner with the traditional methods," Perreault Levasseur said. "Neural networks will help us identify interesting objects and analyze them quickly. This will give us more time to ask the right questions about the universe."_line_A Revolutionary Approach_line_Neural networks are inspired by the architecture of the human brain, in which a dense network of neurons quickly processes and analyzes information._line_In the artificial version, the "neurons" are single computational units that are associated with the pixels of the image being analyzed. The neurons are organized into layers, up to hundreds of layers deep. Each layer searches for features in the image. Once the first layer has found a certain feature, it transmits the information to the next layer, which then searches for another feature within that feature, and so on._line_"The amazing thing is that neural networks learn by themselves what features to look for," said KIPAC staff scientist Phil Marshall, a co-author of the paper. "This is comparable to the way small children learn to recognize objects. You don\'t tell them exactly what a dog is; you just show them pictures of dogs."_line_But in this case, Hezaveh said, "It\'s as if they not only picked photos of dogs from a pile of photos, but also returned information about the dogs\' weight, height and age."_line_Although the KIPAC scientists ran their tests on the Sherlock high-performance computing cluster at the Stanford Research Computing Center, they could have done their computations on a laptop or even on a cell phone, they said. In fact, one of the neural networks they tested was designed to work on iPhones._line_"Neural nets have been applied to astrophysical problems in the past with mixed outcomes," said KIPAC faculty member Roger Blandford, who was not a co-author on the paper. "But new algorithms combined with modern graphics processing units, or GPUs, can produce extremely fast and reliable results, as the gravitational lens problem tackled in this paper dramatically demonstrates. There is considerable optimism that this will become the approach of choice for many more data processing and analysis problems in astrophysics and other fields." _line_More information: Yashar D.

S'No one makes tattoos look quite as good as Zo\xc3\xab Kravitz. If you just got inked, know this: skincare looks a little different when you\xe2\x80\x99re caring for tattoos. The inked area is sensitive for a week or two afterward, and will need extra protection for up to several months if you want them to stay sharp and vibrant. Tattoos are an investment and they last a lifetime \xe2\x80\x94 so treating them right, from day one, is a wise move. Take heed of these skincare pointers for new and old tattoos._line_Hours After Getting Inked_line_The artist will cover the area in saran wrap and tape and tell you to leave it for three to four hours. Leave it on. The area is technically a wound, and the plastic will act as a barrier for bacteria and other antibodies. When you do remove it, wash the area with a mild soap and warm water._line_It may not be glamorous, but Dial Gold Antibacterial Hand Soap is often recommended by peeps with tattoos as it\xe2\x80\x99s mild and fragrance-free. It\xe2\x80\x99ll help keep the area clear of infection and wash off any sweat and scabbing residue. Skip the loofah \xe2\x80\x94 just wash with your hand, rinse well, and then pat dry._line_An optional post-wash option in the first few days is to apply a light layer of ointment like Aquaphor or A+D Original Ointment. These form a protective barrier over the skin and help seal out irritating wetness. A+D Ointment also contains vitamins A and D, which helps heal chafed skin. If you do use an ointment, use it for only a few days before switching to a regular unscented lotion._line_Up to two weeks afterward_line_Continue to wash your tattoo daily to make sure it stays clean, and follow up with a scent-free lotion. Try Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion. This non-greasy, alcohol-free moisturizer is a go-to for new tattoos. Use it twice or more daily. If your tattoo is near a joint, or a place where your skin stretches regularly when you move, err on the side of moisturizing more._line_Two weeks to one month after_line_Continue to moisturize the area after the shower as you would normally after bathing. Over the years, skin tends to lose its natural moisture, so keeping it well-hydrated from the get-go will help keep colours bright. In addition, avoid: submerging the area in water for at least 10 days (keep bathing limited to quicker showers); wearing dirty clothes (sweaty fabrics rubbing on it regularly can hinder healing and even cause infection); and picking scabs. Scabbing is normal and a sign that your tattoo is healing properly._line_One biggie: Avoid tanning beds or too much sun exposure during the first month, as this can cause some inks to fade. If you must expose your tattoo to the sun, apply a sunscreen for sensitive skin that has at least an SPF 15, and reapply every two hours that you\xe2\x80\x99re in the sun. Try Neutrogena\xe2\x80\x99s Pure & Free Baby Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50._line_This hypoallergenic lotion is made for super-sensitive skin, and is infused with anti-irritants and even some antioxidants. Its active ingredients (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) are some of the most gentle you\xe2\x80\x99ll find in the realm of sunscreens._line_Long-term care_line_Inevitably, your tattoo will lighten after it\xe2\x80\x99s fully healed. This just means the layers of skin are growing back over the ink and accepting it. But to keep the glowing pigments close to the surface for as long as possible, use a gentle exfoliant with alpha hydroxy acids, such as Uriage Eau Thermal Gentle Exfoliating Gel._line_This 2-in-1 body scrub and cleanser caters to sensitive skin with a hypoallergenic, soap-free base and and hibiscus flower AHAs. It\xe2\x80\x99s also got exfoliating micro-scrubbers to help gently remove dead cells and stimulate cellular growth so skin stays bright over time._line_'

S'Representative Image_line_ NEW DELHI: The Income Tax Department has slapped a Rs 32,320 crore demand in tax, interest and penalty on Hong Kong-based Hutchison for alleged capital gains it made on the $11 billion sale of its mobile business in India to UK\'s Vodafone Group in 2007. _line_ In a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, billionaire Li Ka-shing\'s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd said its unit, Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd (HTIL) has been served with a tax demand of about Rs 7,900 crore, Rs 16,430 crore of interest and another Rs 7,900 crore in penalty. _line_ The CK Hutchison unit continues to dispute the validity of those taxes, it said. _line_ This is the first time a tax demand on the Hong Kong firm is being raised. So far, the Indian government had been pursuing the tax from Vodafone. _line_ Vodafone was initially slapped with Rs 7,990 crore tax demand for not withholding tax from payments it made to Hutchison. The outstanding after including interest and penalty runs over Rs 20,000 crore. _line_ It challenged the levy and the Supreme Court in January 2012 ruled that the company was not liable to pay any tax over the acquisition of assets in India from Hutchison. _line_ Thereafter, the government in May 2012 amended the tax laws with retrospective effect and claimed taxes. Vodafone has disputed such levy and the matter is before an international arbitration panel. _line_ Besides Vodafone, the retrospective legislation was used to levy a principal tax liability of Rs 10,247 crore on another British company, Cairn Energy Plc. That matter too is before an international arbitration panel. _line_ HTIL, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd, received from the tax department a draft assessment order dated November 24, 2016 alleging gains made on sale of its entire 67 per cent in the India business to Vodafone. _line_ "HTIL received on February 13, 2017 from Income Tax an assessment order dated January 25, 2017 in respect of tax of approximately Rs 7,900 crore on capital gains" in connection with the 2007 deal plus aggregate interest of approximately Rs 16,430 crore," the filing said. _line_ Further, "HTIL received on August 9, 2017 from Income Tax authorities a penalty order dated July 3, 2017 for a penalty of approximately Rs 7,900 crore", it added. _line_ The taxes cannot be validly imposed on HTIL, the filing said, adding that the order issued by the income tax is on the "basis of retrospective legislation seeking to overturn the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in January 2012, which ruled that the acquisition (by Vodafone) was not taxable in India, are in violation of the principles of international law". _line_ "Accordingly the company continues to believe that the orders would not have any effect on the company\'s financial condition or the results of its operations for any period," it said without saying what course of action would it take. _line_ Vodafone had in 2007 acquired 67 per cent stake in the mobile-phone business owned by Hutchison Whampoa, now part of CK Hutchison. _line_ The draft assessment order alleged gains of about Rs 37,400 crore in the 2007 sale to Vodafone International Holdings BV. _line_ The deal happened when HTIL was a listed company. Subsequent to that, HTIL was privatised and ceased business operations. Neither HTIL nor its subsidiaries have any presence in India. _line_'

For this exhibition, Giovanna Calvenzi has gathered the photographs of three fundamental journeys for the artist, then 25 years old. Indicative of the name, the diaries take the viewers through the different travels of the artist when he is still a student and visits Iran in 1970, then Morocco in 1971 and has not yet made a choice between architecture and photography, two fields that fascinate him. The different works reflect his budding interest in urban landscape, but mainly his knowledge of committed photography and of Bill Brandt\xe2\x80\x99s lesson._line_Gabriele Basilico (August 12, 1944 \xe2\x80\x93 February 13, 2013) was an Italian photographer and is best known as an artist who defined himself as "a measurer of space.\xe2\x80\x9d Born in Milan, he originally studied to become an architect before pursuing a career in photography. Most of his initial works focused around traditional landscape photography. However, during the later years of his career, he shifted his focus to architectural photography due to the influence of his previous studies in architecture. He achieved international fame in 1982 with his photographic report on the industrial areas of Milan, "Ritratti di Fabbriche, Sugarco."_line_The exhibition will be on view from November 7 through December 23, 2017 Gallery Anne Barrault, 51 rue des Archives F - 75003 Paris. _line_For details, visit: http://www.galerieannebarrault.com/ _line_Click on the slideshow for a sneak peek at the exhibition._line_'

S'Shannon Basner/Paw-Prints, Howls and Purrs_line_An earlier version of this article was published on the Britannica blog Advocacy for Animals._line_There have been more than 30 reality TV shows set in Alaska. Many of these spotlight\xe2\x80\x94intentionally or accidentally\xe2\x80\x94the wildlife in the state and the way humans interact with it. There are grizzly bears, black bears, moose, ptarmigan, lynxes, wolves, whales, and a host of other critters._line_None of these shows have focused on one animal that\xe2\x80\x99s just as ubiquitous in Alaska as it is in the rest of the country\xe2\x80\x94the feral cat. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that there may be as many as 50 million feral cats in the United States. A feral cat is an undomesticated outdoor cat or a stray or abandoned cat that has reverted to a wild state. Truly feral cats will never be amenable to living with humans. Feral cats can be born or made. Animals reproduce indiscriminately if left unchecked. But often the problem starts with people failing to spay or neuter their pets and allowing them to roam or abandoning them. Feral cats form groups called colonies, and each colony adopts a territory. It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that they\xe2\x80\x99re found even in Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s rugged clime._line_What is surprising is that the state that has both an unofficial cat mayor and a tradition of working to live in harmony with its wildlife\xe2\x80\x94a necessity given the overlap of humans into animals\xe2\x80\x99 habitats\xe2\x80\x94also has a feral cat problem and a reluctance to embrace a solution. _line_The most effective way to keep the number of feral cats in check is a widespread program called trap-neuter-return (TNR). Cats are trapped, neutered, vaccinated, ear-tipped (ear-tipping removes the tip of one of a cat\xe2\x80\x99s ears while the animal is under anesthesia as a future marker to indicate that the cat is altered and belongs to a colony), and returned to their territories, where they lead healthier lives and no longer reproduce. Friendly cats are re-homed, and kittens are removed from colonies while they are young enough to socialize. Over time, the population of the colony naturally decreases as the cats maintain their territorial boundaries, which leads to fewer cats per capita. This is supported by data from the Humane Society, which adds that \xe2\x80\x9cprograms that attempt to use lethal control to eliminate cat populations are inhumane, ineffective, and wasteful of scarce resources.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_But TNR is illegal in Alaska, thanks to an antiquated rule in the Alaska Administrative Code: \xe2\x80\x9cThe following species\xe2\x80\xa6may not be released into the wild.\xe2\x80\x9d Dogs and cats are the first animals on the list. This rule antedates TNR programs and was not designed to outlaw them, but it has effectively tied the hands of rescue organizations in the state that are willing to take on this responsibility to benefit both cats and communities._line_Leading the charge to change this rule is the Anchorage-based animal rescue group Mojo\xe2\x80\x99s Hope. After concerned citizen Marjorie Carter met with the Anchorage Animal Control Advisory Board and learned that a TNR program could not be implemented because of the rule, she connected with Mojo\xe2\x80\x99s Hope, and the rescue group agreed to spearhead the mission. Carter and Shannon Basner, one of the cofounders of Mojo\xe2\x80\x99s Hope, met with Alaska state officials to explore avenues for moving forward, which include a regulatory or statutory change or amending the rule to grant each municipality the power to dictate its own policies on TNR. A regulatory change would be processed through the Department of Fish and Game. A statutory change would go through the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office. Basner and Michael Haukedalen, Director of the Alaska chapter of the Humane Society, met with Alaska Senator Bill Wielechowski to discuss options. Another choice includes amending the current rule to change the definition of \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude returning feral cats to the same locations where they were captured._line_Basner pointed out that a statewide TNR program would be funded by grants and donations and would save municipalities money, with shelters having to handle and euthanize fewer cats. \xe2\x80\x9cThe state absolutely does not have to pay anything for the program, unless they want to provide a grant. It\xe2\x80\x99s their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d There are hundreds of TNR programs in place around the country. Without TNR programs, feral cats end up in shelters but are not adoptable, so they are euthanized. \xe2\x80\x9cThe shelter is just following the rules,\xe2\x80\x9d said Basner, adding that Anchorage Animal Care and Control \xe2\x80\x9cdoes an outstanding job of housing animals, as they are the only open admission shelter.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_There are some rescues working for ferals in Alaska that have found ways around the current rule. Loving Companions Animal Rescue in the North Pole and St. Frances Animal Rescue in Wrangell trap, spay and neuter, and vaccinate feral cats. What they don\xe2\x80\x99t do, however, is return them. Both organizations manage colonies on their own land. This is a good solution for a few ferals, but, in order to bring the population of feral cats down statewide, TNR needs to be practicable in communities where the cats live. A finite amount of animals can be saved through relocation, whereas spaying one breeding pair in a colony can stop the production of a staggering estimated 100 to 5,000 offspring. When feral cats are needlessly trapped and killed, it creates what Alley Cat Allies terms a \xe2\x80\x9cvacuum effect,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9csurvivors continue to breed, and new cats move in to the now-available territory.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_As much as she\xe2\x80\x99d like to start helping feral cats now through TNR, Basner steadfastly maintains Mojo\xe2\x80\x99s Hope\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to changing the rule: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be the face of change, we can\xe2\x80\x99t take the risk now.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Feral cats in Alaska face other challenges besides their caretakers running afoul of the law. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have eagles, owls, bears, cars, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the weather,\xe2\x80\x9d Basner said. To help feral cats survive in such extreme temperatures, the group will provide insulated doghouses to caretakers. Because winter is so harsh, the group advocates putting only feral animals back outdoors and working with shelters and other rescue groups to find homes and fosters for social and adoptable animals. This, coupled with an effective TNR program, would humanely reduce the population of feral cats in the state over time._line_'

S'The storm had transformed roads into rivers in America\'s fourth-largest city, driving more than 8,000 people into emergency shelters._line_ HOUSTON: After pouring record rains on Texas, Tropical Storm Harvey made a second landfall today to strike Louisiana, a state that still bears deep scars from 2005\'s Hurricane Katrina. _line_ The second hit comes five days after the monster storm slammed onshore as a Category Four hurricane, pummelling the US Gulf coast with torrential rains that turned neighbourhoods into lakes in America\'s fourth largest city, Houston. _line_Harvey made its second landfall just west of the town of Cameron, the National Hurricane Center said, with "flooding rains" drenching parts of southeastern Texas and neighbouring southwestern Louisiana. _line_ Louisiana residents braced for Harvey\'s ferocious maximum sustained winds nearing 45 miles (72 kilometres) per hour, with forecasters predicting another five to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimetres) of rain could pour on the region. _line_ They expect Harvey will gradually weaken to a tropical depression by tonight, meaning maximum sustained winds should slow. _line_ But low-lying New Orleans was still girding for the storm, just a day after the 12-year anniversary of Katrina, which ravaged the vulnerable city famous for its jazz music and cuisine. _line_ The New Orleans branch of the National Weather Service said a heavy rain threat remained over southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi through tomorrow, when relatively drier weather is finally slated to arrive. _line_ One night prior to the second landfall, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu tweeted to "remind #NOLA that we are not yet in the clear," urging residents to "remain vigilant and cautious." _line_ In Texas emergency crews were still struggling to reach hundreds of stranded people in a massive round-the-clock rescue operation - but the National Weather Service tweeted that weather conditions there were to at last improve. _line_ The storm had transformed roads into rivers in America\'s fourth-largest city, driving more than 8,000 people into emergency shelters. _line_ Houstonians woke up yesterday from a nighttime curfew declared by Mayor Sylvester Turner aimed at aiding search efforts and thwarting potential looting in the flood-ravaged city. _line_ At least one bridge had crumbled, one levee had breached and dams were at risk in the Lone Star State. _line_ The full scale of the catastrophe\'s impact - including the number of deaths and the extent of destruction - remained difficult for authorities to gauge, as rescue efforts were ongoing and much of the city remained flood-stricken. _line_ US media reports indicated the death toll could have risen to 30, and authorities feared confirming more once the worst had past and search teams could again travel roads. _line_ A Houston police officer was confirmed the latest victim of the storm after the body of Steve Perez, who went missing after reporting for duty in the early hours of Sunday, was recovered by divers two days later. _line_ Harvey was previously known to have left at least three people dead, with six more fatalities potentially tied to the storm. _line_ Everywhere, the figures from the storm are staggering. The National Weather Service said over six million Texans have been impacted by 30 inches or more of rain since Friday. _line_ Residents living around a chemical plant in the county that includes Houston were evacuated as a precaution, over fears that some of the chemicals at the facility - which produces organic peroxides - might react or cause an explosion. _line_ Andrea Aviles, 16, fled her home along with her family yesterday. She and some 30 extended family members were now crammed into a hotel in the small town of Winnie. _line_ "I\'ve never seen it like this," she said of the flooding. "All our yard is full of water." _line_ Hugging the road\'s central median in their Suburban vehicle - water reaching halfway up the tires - they passed ditches full of abandoned cars. _line_ "It was sad," she said. "It\'s overwhelming." _line_  President Donald Trump toured the Harvey disaster zone in Texas yesterday as he sought to project an image of leadership in America\'s first major natural disaster since he took office. _line_'

S'Social activist Anna Hazare on 30 August wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi declaring another round of agitation over the government\'s apathy in appointing a Lokpal and Lokayukta even after three years in power._line_In his letter to the Prime Minister, Hazare said he would continue campaign in the state capital till the Lokayukta is not appointed and the Swaminathan Commission Report is not implemented._line_"I have written many letters to you regarding the appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta but I have not received any reply for you nor have I seen any action from your side. Due to the increasing rate of corruption, people trusted your words, but even today no work gets done without paying money. Inflation has also not come down," he said in his letter._line_"For the past three years, I have reminded you to react on the issue of Lokpal and Lokayukta, but everytime I have to experience dismay. There have been various editions of Mann Ki Baat not even in one, you discussed the issue of Lokpal and Lokayukta," he added._line_Expressing his dismay, he further said that the promise of bringing back black money has also not been addressed by the Prime Minister._line_"You don\'t speak of implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta laws passed for curbing corruption. May be you have forgotten the things which you promised," he added._line_Hazare said that steps should be taken to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce._line_"Only giving assurance to the people that you will give a corruption-free India is not enough, but acting upon it will make some changes. By appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta, 50 to 60 per cent of corruption will reduce in the country.

I have urged to the government several times looking into the matter of the MSP, but yet again I didn\'t receive any response in reply to my concerns. It has now become evident that you have no sentiments for the farmers of this country. It would have been better had you paid attention to farmers the way you are concerned about industrialists. It is very unfortunate," he added._line_At the end, he said that due to such a stance of the Prime Minister, he is mulling another agitation. _line_-ANI_line_'

S'View of Hurricane #Harvey from onboard ISS. Photo: Twitter_line_ Fifty inches of rain. Nine trillion gallons of water. The Gulf Coast of Texas, and especially the Houston metropolitan area, has been inundated by rain produced by Hurricane Harvey. And as of this writing, the rain continues along a broad swath of the Gulf Coast, with a flood threat extending all the way east through New Orleans to the Florida Panhandle._line_ Even for one of the wettest and most flood-prone parts of the United States, the rainfall totals and flooding are breaking records. So, what has made Harvey such a prodigious rain producer?_line_ A \xe2\x80\x98train\xe2\x80\x99 of rainstorms _line_ The amount of rain that falls at a given location can be boiled down to a surprisingly simple equation: The total precipitation equals the average rainfall rate, multiplied by the rainfall duration. In other words, the most rain falls where it rains the hardest for the longest._line_ Tropical cyclones in general are very efficient rain producers, because they draw large quantities of water vapor into the atmosphere from a warm ocean. That moist air rises and the water vapor condenses, and a large fraction of that water falls as rain. Tropical cyclones can also last a long time; if their motion slows, then a particular region can experience that heavy rainfall for multiple days._line_ Even compared to other tropical cyclones, the rain from Harvey has been very hard, and gone for a very long time. On Saturday evening (August 26) into Sunday morning (August 27), an intense band of storms developed to the east of Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s center, and lined itself up right over Houston. This is a process known as \xe2\x80\x9cecho training,\xe2\x80\x9d in which it appears that the individual thunderstorm cells are like train cars that repeatedly pass over the same spot and bring with them heavy precipitation._line_ This precipitation band was producing up to six inches of rain per hour \xe2\x80\x93 an extremely high rate \xe2\x80\x93 and it remained over the Houston metro area for several hours, with a couple more that followed immediately after. One location just southeast of downtown Houston recorded 13.84 inches in just three hours. These rains from Saturday night into Sunday morning initiated the massive flooding in the Houston metro area._line_Image from NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s GOES-16 satellite at 9:42 p.m. CDT on August 26, 2017. Infrared image shows the temperature of cloud tops, with red and black colors indicating very intense thunderstorms. Colorado State University/Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere_line_Animation from the Houston, Texas National Weather Service radar on Saturday evening, August 26, 2017. The left panel shows radar reflectivity, which is related to rainfall intensity. The right panel shows radial velocity (green colors toward the radar, red colors away). The green polygons show flash flood warnings issued by the NWS, including a rare \xe2\x80\x98flash flood emergency\xe2\x80\x99 for Houston._line_ Relentless rainfall_line_ Then, after this initial intense burst, there has been no respite. Usually, when a tropical cyclone turns poleward from the tropics toward the United States, it will interact with one or more midlatitude weather systems that will send the storm on its way after a day or two. But this August, the jet stream has been positioned well to the north of Texas, so none of these disturbances has approached, and Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s center of circulation has barely moved since it made landfall. As a result, across the Texas (and now Louisiana) coast, there have been periods with intense rainfall (in more of the rainbands described above), along with lighter, but still substantial, accumulations._line_Hourly rainfall amounts (in inches) between 8 p.m. CDT Saturday, August 26 to 8 p.m. CDT Monday, August 28, at Harris County Gauge C106_310 Berry Bayou @ Nevada Avenue. This station is located just southeast of downtown Houston. By the morning of Wednesday, August 29, this station had received over 44 inches of rainfall over the previous week. Harris County Flood Warning System_line_ This combination of unusually high rain rates and long duration has resulted in a very large area with 30 to 45 inches of rain in a few days._line_ Those of us who study extreme rainfall and flooding, and those who live in and around Houston, know this area is vulnerable to both very heavy rainfall and destructive and deadly floods. The previous standard-bearer for extreme rainfall in the region was Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001, which produced just over 40" of rain around Houston. But the excessive accumulations were fairly localized. Major floods again occurred on Memorial Day in 2015, and on April 18-19, 2016._line_ In the April 2016 event, an intense line of overnight storms produced up to 15" of rain in a few hours, similar to the \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d rainbands in Harvey. But with Harvey, the area covered by the heavy rainfall has been vastly larger, and the rain has persisted for days. For comparison, in just one day (ending Sunday morning, August 27, 2017) the area covered by rainfall from Harvey exceeding 16" is several times larger than the entire April 2016 flood event, and at least two more days of similar accumulations have followed._line_ Tornado risks_line_ To make matters even worse, there were also numerous tornadoes reported as the rainbands came on shore. It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly common to have tornadoes occur in association with landfalling hurricanes, but what struck me in this case was that tornado warnings were being issued in the same places that had just received massive amounts of rain._line_ My research group has studied the challenges associated with multi-hazard situations, and specifically when the threats of tornadoes and flash flooding occur in the same place at the same time, as the protective responses to those hazards can be at odds with each other. For people to be under both a tornado and a flash-flood warning at the same time is surprisingly common \xe2\x80\x93 these overlapping warnings occur around 400 times per year on average._line_ But this situation was taken to a new extreme during Harvey, when tornado warnings were being issued at the same time that emergency officials were sending messages for people to go to their roofs for safety (rather than risk getting caught in the attic). The heartbreaking (but also heroic) video footage of water rescues speaks to the immense human impact of this multifaceted storm._line_ Spot-on forecast_line_ One final remarkable aspect of Hurricane Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s rainfall is how accurate numerical weather prediction models \xe2\x80\x93 and the human forecasters who use them to make official forecasts \xe2\x80\x93 were at highlighting the incredible precipitation accumulations._line_ Medium-range forecast models at least a week in advance were showing Harvey stalling out along the Texas coast and producing extreme rainfall. As the event neared, essentially every numerical model was showing accumulations over 25 inches. Often, when meteorologists see models making predictions of events that would be unprecedented, we are rather skeptical of that guidance, because there are no points of reference to compare to. But in this case, the models were in close agreement about the potential for a truly major event, and forecasters saw the gravity of the situation._line_ The NOAA Weather Prediction Center, which makes official rainfall forecasts (and rarely includes extreme amounts), on Friday afternoon (August 25) predicted a broad swath of over 20 inches, with isolated areas up to 40". Never before had the Weather Prediction Center issued a \xe2\x80\x9chigh risk\xe2\x80\x9d of excessive rainfall three days in advance, as usually the uncertainties with forecasting precipitation don\xe2\x80\x99t allow enough confidence to do so. In fact, their protocol didn\xe2\x80\x99t even allow for such an alert so far in advance! But for Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s rainfall, they did this on consecutive days, and with high accuracy, because of the expected extremity of the event. (The primary errors in the rainfall forecasts in advance of the storm is that they placed the maxima a bit southwest of Houston, instead of centered over Houston.)_line_Forecast graphic from the NOAA Weather Prediction Center. Tweeted at 5:47 p.m. CDT Friday, August 25, 2017._line_ One of the fascinating aspects of studying extreme rainfall and flash floods is the wide variety of storm systems that can produce heavy rain, and trying to figure out how the ingredients came together in each of those diverse situations to inform and improve future forecasting._line_ For Hurricane Harvey, researchers and forecasters will be analyzing the ingredients that led to this record-setting flood for many years to come._line_'

S' Amagi Media Is Currently Harnessing The Power Of $3.5 Bn Television Advertising Space While Exploring OTT Platforms _line_\xe2\x80\x9cSelling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d This statement made by Peter Thiel in his book Zero to One aptly describes the ongoing fag behind the glamorous advertisement screens of the businesses. From print to television, and from digital to personalisation, we have come a long way in luring customers via marketing tactics of varied kinds. While the marketers today seem to be having a run towards digital adtech, there is one venture, still capitalising on the traditional TV advertising mode, at the same time harnessing the power of new age tech such as geo targeting, machine learning and deep learning, which is The Amagi Media Labs._line_For the millennials, Amagi Media Labs is the pioneer of geo targeting based TV advertising in the country. The Bengaluru-based media technology company has also been touted by media as India\xe2\x80\x99s largest TV ad network._line_Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at few stats of the company:_line_Working with 23 geo-targeting channels from the stable of Zee group, Viacom 18, Sun group, TV 18, Times, NDTV and Discovery_line_A network of 4000+ small and big brands who have used its geo-targeted solutions till date._line_Enabling large TV networks like AMC Networks, FLIK TV, B4U, VIACOM 18, D-sports, Turner, Scribbs network, Zee, NDTV and around 100+ channels to launch, operate, and monetise channels anywhere in the world._line_Deployments in over 40+ countries._line_$45.2 Mn raised in funding and backed by investors such as Emerald Media, Mayfield Fund, Nadathur Holdings, Ojas Venture Partners, and PremjiInvest._line_A team of 260 employees, R&D centre in Bengaluru and Sales offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Kolkata, etc along with global offices in London, New York and Hong Kong._line_Since the launch in 2008, the founding trio \xe2\x80\x93 Baskar Subramanian, K A Srinivasan and Srividhya Srinivasan, classmates in college and colleagues at Texas Instruments \xe2\x80\x93 are being known for the numerous awards and accolades for the innovations they have brought to the industry. For the trio, this is their second venture together, the first being a wireless audio technology company, Impulsesoft, acquired by Sify Technologies in 2006._line_Post Amagi Media\xe2\x80\x99s launch, there have been a few companies which launched the similar products in India. This included Rediff\xe2\x80\x99s Vubites and Star India\xe2\x80\x99s Adsharp. While Vubites has already stopped operations, Amagi Media claims its technology to be way superior from Adsharp, which is powered by Cisco Technologies._line_We also came across another venture, Gaian Solutions based out of India, Singapore and the US, offering almost the similar product stack as of Amagi Media. However, we found that the company is majorly involved in government projects and has a plethora of other solutions linked to building the impactful content experiences in sectors such as banks, hospitals, hotels, education and more._line_However, Amagi Media is one player that is solely leveraging geo targeting technologies in TV advertising to increase a brand\xe2\x80\x99s reach to its targeted audience. This reflects in the company financials too._line_As shared by Baskar, the company is growing at an aggregated growth rate of 250% year on year. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are already in a bracket of $15.63 Mn (INR 100 Cr) revenue and we further aim to grow about , 2x this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he added._line_A Glimpse Into The Amagi Media Empire: The Vision, Product Stack, And More_line_Baskar believes, that India is very \xe2\x80\x9cregional\xe2\x80\x99 in its competition even when it comes to large advertisers. Today, every brand in every market faces competition from local brands. Even the leading global brands like Unilever, Glaxos and P&G need to win regional turf wars and not just one big national war. Every product has heterogeneity in terms of market demand._line_Also, for a majority of the brands, a significant percentage of revenue comes from the Tier II and Tier III cities. These include cities where internet penetration is quite low and online marketing will not get the desired results. Again, TV is only medium to reach the masses here._line_It is this very need of enabling the brands to closely target their potential consumer base, the Amagi Media\xe2\x80\x99s vision stands on._line_Amagi Media, through its offerings enables large TV networks and channels to launch, operate, and monetise channels anywhere in the world. This is backed by Amagi\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-broadcast technology, geo targeting system, and patents as well as series of products such as Amagi Mix, STORM, ThunderSTORM and more, thereby working closely with even SME\xe2\x80\x99s and OTT players._line_The company also recently partnered with BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council ) in October 2016, to monitor geo targeting based TV advertising and help advertisers evaluate their national geo targeting based ad-campaigns on BARC India\xe2\x80\x99s software. The team is also working on exploring machine learning and deep learning capabilities, and will soon be announcing some major additions in its product stack in next few months._line_Sowing The Seeds Of Amagi Media Labs: The Hassles Of Concept Ideation_line_Richard Branson once said, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has a monopoly on good ideas, and you can never tell exactly when you will come up with them.\xe2\x80\x9d The similar thing happened with the Amagi Media founders._line_After wrapping up their first venture, the trio was searching for another idea to experiment and was looking at multitudes of plans in different business models, different markets and growing trends._line_As Baskar reminisced, \xe2\x80\x9cThis was an incidence of 2007. One Monday morning, around 11 AM, we were sitting in a park in Bengaluru and were discussing what innovation could we do in television or media. Suddenly, a young boy approached us and asked to show our hands to him and claimed to tell our future. It struck to us that this young boy clearly knows, two people sitting in a park on a Monday morning are jobless, and it\xe2\x80\x99s his chance to earn. So he knows it clearly how to target his customers exactly. And we struck gold then and there only.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_This was the time when TV advertising was considered as the domain only for brands with big budget for media advertising. For any advertiser to showcase its ad on television, a national tv advertising spot had to be bought. As per data available, in 2007, for a 10 sec national spot, an advertiser needs to pay around INR 3,50,000, which is quite expensive to afford by the small brands or brands with only regional presence. Even today, a 30 seconds national advertising spot on an average cost INR 1 Mn for most Indian shows._line_To this Baskar added,_line_\xe2\x80\x9cWe realise, that similar to the astrologer boy, the TV advertisers also require a targeted advertising. It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely irrelevant to market your product nationally if you are selling only in New Delhi. From an outsider perspective, we saw media as an exciting opportunity. Clearly, being from a technology background we would wanted to look at how technology can be leveraged to disrupt the media ecosystem, and create more value for the whole ecosystem.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Dousing The Idea Seeds With Experience: The Tech Twists Added To Traditional TV Advertising _line_The idea Amagi Media Labs rooted for, was simple. It buys commercial time on TV channels such as ZEE, IBN 7, etc. and sells the ad spots to advertisers on the regional/ hyperlocal basis. In this manner, one ad spot, which traditionally gets occupied by one national ad, then become available for multiple advertisers parallelly, reducing the cost for advertisers and increasing per spot price for the TV channel._line_For instance, at present, Amagi Media\xe2\x80\x99s pan India market is divided into 20 divisions. These markets can be a specific city-like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, a state like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh or a region like North East, Punjab/Harayana/Chandigarh among others. Hence, a single ad spot can be sold to 20 different advertisers for each channel._line_This implies that, during a daily soap advertisement break, a person sitting in Mumbai can might be possibly watching a different commercial, and a person in the same time zone in Delhi, can be watching another commercial._line_Also, if a national ad spot costs suppose, INR 100, then using Amagi Media\xe2\x80\x99s technology, the same spot can be sold 20 times for different pricing in different regions. For example, INR 20 in Delhi, INR 30 in Punjab and so on. Thus, on average, a TV channel gets more than what it can get by selling it only to a national spot._line_As Baskar added, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say there is a 30 second ad spot. Traditionally on it the same ad was going nationally, but now for every region a different ad is broadcasted for the same 30 sec spot. So this means that both of you are watching same content but during the ad break, you are seeing different adds. Thus, while a TV channel is earning more for the same ad spot, an advertiser is paying only for its targeted users and not the entire nation. This created a win-win situation for both the TV channels as well as advertisers.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_So, What\xe2\x80\x99s The Tech Behind This?_line_Typically, TV channels go off the satellites and then comes down to different multiple cable tv boxes or DTH servers. At these locations are kept the smart boxes, which has the capability to store data as well as identify the spot where the location specific ad has to replace the national one._line_The trigger for the geo targeting based TV advertising comes from a unique watermark inserted on the video/audio signal. The watermark is a kind of invisible and inaudible identifier like a product barcode, which on being scanned by the smartbox, gives the cue to run a local/regional ad and bypass the national ad to where it\xe2\x80\x99s required._line_As mentioned on Amagi Media\xe2\x80\x99s web page, \xe2\x80\x9cAmagi\xe2\x80\x99s solution can be customised to support the duration and frequency of all ad-replacement needs. Amagi\xe2\x80\x99s solution is based on a patented content trigger (The Amagi Watermark) and STORM, an enhanced satellite receiver that descramblers and decodes the channel in addition to inserting local ad seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Let\xe2\x80\x99s Consider Some Use Cases._line_Amagi Media has worked with a number of brands to date and help them reach their target audiences. The first use case Baskar shared was of Santoor \xe2\x80\x93 whose main TG is South market. Apart from regional channels, to increase their share of voice to the share of market, they use Amagi channels also effectively, like Zee TV or Zee Cinema._line_Another example would be Horlicks whose main markets are east and South or Dove, which is an urban tier 1 brand. Through Amagi\xe2\x80\x99s geo-targeted solution, they can advertise on mainstream channels at city/state specific levels._line_\xe2\x80\x9cFurther Amagi Media has been assisting a lot of SMEs with Amagi mix to come on TV as well since it is now possible to advertise on national TVs at a fraction of national cost due to geo-targeting. With Amagi\xe2\x80\x99s new e-portal Amagi Mix, we are making quality media planning, buying and data analytics accessible to SMEs across the nation which was not there earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d added Baskar._line_Selling Out The Concept Of Geo targeting In TV Advertising: The Initial Struggle To Establish Amagi Media Brand_line_Well, as the experienced ones say, building geo targeting technology is one thing, however, doing business is an altogether different experience. Amagi Media founders had no exceptions here. The first few challenges in front of the co-founders were to prepare a business plan, search for an office space, and then most importantly convince marketers and advertisers of the benefit their geo targeting technology can bring on board._line_So, they sat down at coffee shops and in around a month time, finally came up with a good business plan. The trio then ended up at Nadathur S Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL) of Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru and started with Amagi Media Labs._line_As Baskar said, \xe2\x80\x9cAt that time TV and advertising_line_\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time TV and advertising was already a huge INR 15000 Cr market, that we were trying to disrupt, that too with a technology and a business model that people have not heard of. So, we keep on conjuring answers to questions such as why would people will hear us, why would advertisers will adopt this technology, how should we go and pitch, etc. We were complete outsiders to the industry. So the challenges were high enough for us.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Thus, in order to make their pitch strong, they spent time with advertisers and various channels both in India and abroad to identify their key issues._line_\xe2\x80\x9cBy 2009, we got an understanding that the existing TV advertising business is a very complex set of the ecosystem, and we were just three people in a room trying to tap out an idea which proves very very far fetched. However, fast forward to today, we are India\xe2\x80\x99s largest geo targeted advertising centre. It was 2010 when we started the business, and in the last 10 years we have created a new market and evolved it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added._line_Baskar further believes that globally, the decision-making process is much faster than in India. There has been seen resistance to change in the Indian market, to adopt new technology in the domain of TV advertising._line_\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something more cultural and we are hoping this will change with time. At present, the major challenge is posed by our existing infrastructure and that has to evolve with time. Also, the readiness index to experiment and adapt to new technologies is very low in India, which ultimately makes the entire structure, the biggest challenge to survive in,\xe2\x80\x9d he added._line_In Conclusion_line_Since the human started trading, advertisements in different form have been used to gain attention and establish a clear positioning in the end consumer\xe2\x80\x99s mind. However different the venture is, be it online or offline; startup or an established brand, reaching the target audiences is the most tedious task every business is brainstorming on._line_While India is leapfrogging to be a digital nation by 2020, it is expected that digital ad spending In India will be on rise. However, the current stats present an entirely different picture here._line_A June 2017 report by Magna projected that even in the next five years, Television will still be the largest media in 2021 with a market share of 39%. Thus, leaving behind offline media at 9.7% and digital at 25.5% growth. While living in a digital era, the word \xe2\x80\x98still\xe2\x80\x99 naturally drives one to the immense potential this sector has to offer. And, on this growth are capitalising adtech firms like Amagi Media._line_The report further adds that \xe2\x80\x9cTelevision advertising is expected to grow at over 10.3%, with Free to Air (FTA) channels gaining significance, localised content and high-definition (HD) experience boosting regional channels\xe2\x80\x99 viewership.\xe2\x80\x9d Another report by Exchange4media suggested that among the various traditional media advertising, spends on television stand at maximum 41% with INR 22,872 cr._line_This is another opportunity for the advertising firms engaged in building the primary infrastructure for geo targeting ads to regional audiences. With products like Amagi Mix, Amagi Cloud and Amagi Measure, Amagi Media is currently leading the pack. The analysts further believe that in near future geo targeting can be evolved to an extent that a broadcaster can insert regional daily shows and movies, just like advertisements, during the national playout of the content._line_However, one cannot deny the fact that digital advertising is pacing up rapidly with TV advertising and other solutions. Digital adtech has been touted to register a 28% growth rate, and digital ad spends have been predicted to reach INR 10, 227 Cr mark in next five years by Magna. Within digital, mobile is driving spends with a growth rate of 65.7%._line_Amagi Media has started exploring options such as Thunderstorm, connecting it with the OTT platforms. But with each and every market getting crowded with more and more players, the entry barriers are quite low even for the companies working with patent technologies. So, how possibly Amagi Media be able to maintain its growth intact, will get unfold with time. For now, Amagi Media is on its way to become the mogul of Indian TV advertising industry, harnessing the power of geo targeting._line_'

S'RTR has the best-sounding engine here._line_FZ\xe2\x80\x99s motor has highest capacity, but relaxed tune._line_NS\xe2\x80\x99 engine is punchy, but not refined._line_RTR\xe2\x80\x99s all-LCD panel is very informative._line_No gear indicator on FZ\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster._line_Analogue tacho on Pulsar looks smashing._line_LED headlight of the FZ is a boon._line_Apache has sharpest handling and best ride quality._line_Pulsar\xe2\x80\x99s brakes offer best bite and feel._line_There was a time, not long ago, in the Indian two-wheeler space, where a 150cc, four-stroke motorcycle was considered the pinnacle of performance. Those of us who\xe2\x80\x99ve spent our formative riding years on such machines craved for more... more power, sharper brakes, better handling. Oh, how things have changed! Today, 150cc bikes represent both commuter and the entry-level of sport bikes available to enthusiasts in India. But while these sporty 150s are quite capable and fairly fun, things don\xe2\x80\x99t really get exciting till you really get into the 200-plus cc space, pushing 20-odd horsepower. It\xe2\x80\x99s a category that barely existed a few years ago and now we\xe2\x80\x99re close to getting spoiled for choice._line_So we have three contenders vying for attention in this space, the oldest one of which is the latest generation of the bike that kicked off performance motorcycling in the country \xe2\x80\x93 the Pulsar. Its NS200 guise borrows its powerplant from none other than the KTM 200 Duke, packaged into an extremely capable setup. The second one is the Apache RTR 200, which comes from a long line of TVS\xe2\x80\x99 motorcycles which have had their origins on the race track. The newest entrant in this space is also a bit of an outlier. The Yamaha FZ\xe2\x80\x99s engine has quite a bit more cubic capacity than the other two, but stacks up quite closely in terms of performance. These three represent the best bikes you can buy today in India, with a budget of a little over a lakh of rupees. But choosing one amongst these three isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very straightforward affair._line_Eye candy_line_Park them all together and it almost feels like the brief given to the designers at each of the manufacturers must\xe2\x80\x99ve been nearly the same \xe2\x80\x93 create a sculpted, muscular motorcycle that feels like a proper scaled down version of a litre-class naked. I think Bajaj has really nailed this look perfectly. Barring new paint scheme and body stickers, the design of the NS200 remains unchanged from when it was launched over five years ago. And it barely seems to have aged in this period. Seen in profile, its chunky perimeter frame dominates the view. Thanks to its bulbous fuel tank with large extensions and the neatly tucked away underbelly exhaust, all the bike\xe2\x80\x99s mass seems to be well-centralised, and is neatly offset by a sharp tail with an absolutely uncluttered number plate holder. Nestled behind the top of the bikini fairing is a large instrument cluster that has an analogue tachometer alongside an LCD information panel. This instrumentation is very easy to read, but misses out on some vital info such as the gear indicator. Switchgear looks good, at least visually, although the indicator switch has absolutely no feel and it was malfunctioning in our test bike after a thorough soak in the rain._line_The RTR 200 retains a little of the TVS Apache design lineage, but takes the overall aesthetics in a much more aggressive direction. The lines are a lot sharper now and the RTR 200 has a mean, hunkered down look which can be credited to its swooping tank extensions and high tail. Even the headlamp and fairing sit lower than they ever did in any Apache before. The faux air intakes in the tail panel are a wonderful addition and continue the beefy design theme even to the back of the bike. However, the massive double-barrel exhaust slung to the right of the bike, which looks like a gun taken straight from some futuristic first person shooter videogame, is a love-it-or-hate-it affair. But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to dislike about the all-digital instrument panel which is the most informative one in this lot here._line_The FZ25 looks quite familiar as it does carry over a general aesthetic style from the FZ16/FZ FI family, even though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share a single panel with the smaller bike. It does look quite brawny and its proportions are somewhat exaggerated, thanks to hefty tank shrouds with faux air intakes and a relatively smaller headlight assembly. The stubby exhaust can looks nice but keeps the visual focus on the mid-section of the bike; around the engine and fuel tank that is. While it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a very good-looking motorcycle, it looks a bit busy with a little too many sculpted elements. And just like the RTR 200, it too gets completely digital LCD instruments. What is really commendable on the FZ25, however, is the overall fit-and-finish and quality of the panels, which lend the bike a solid feel. It goes without saying that all three of these are rather handsome machines, and picking one based on the way it looks is going to be a highly subjective matter._line_In the hot seat_line_Naked bikes need to feel big and macho when you swing a leg over them, and in this department, the Pulsar and FZ really deliver. All three bikes have large, tall fuel tanks and split seats, however the seat to handlebars distance gives these two a slightly leaned forward riding posture. With more rear set foot pegs, the Pulsar definitely feels like it has the sportiest riding position of the three, while the FZ clearly seems to favour a more relaxed posture. The FZ also has the lowest saddle height of the trio (795mm), but at 800mm and 805mm, the seats of the RTR 200 and NS200 respectively aren\xe2\x80\x99t significantly taller. Unlike the RTR and Pulsar, which get clip-ons, the FZ gets a proper single-piece handlebar. The RTR has the most unique riding position of the lot. The bars are a lot closer to the rider, but are low enough for a mild leaned posture in order to get more weight over the front end for some spirited riding. The pegs too, while high enough to give plenty of cornering clearance, are a bit forward set. All of this makes for a more compact rider\xe2\x80\x99s triangle, and even though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hamper the riding experience in any way, it does give the impression that you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on a small bike. As compact as the ergonomics are, even my colleague Rishaad who\xe2\x80\x99s well over six feet in height had absolutely no problems fitting on the RTR 200. However, if you want a big-bike feel from the saddle, then the Pulsar NS200 is your best bet._line_Power play_line_The FZ25\xe2\x80\x99s motor is a real surprise, considering that it has a 25 percent higher cubic capacity than the other two, but is in the same league when it comes to power. It makes just 20.9hp from a 249cc, single-cylinder air-and-oil-cooled unit, which is down to its two-valve setup and a relaxed state of tune. So what it lacks in power figures, it makes up for in terms of refinement. It\xe2\x80\x99s a smooth experience that\xe2\x80\x99s typical Yamaha fare and immediately reminds you of the way the original FZ16\xe2\x80\x99s engine felt, with only minor vibrations coming in at the foot pegs once you\xe2\x80\x99re revving above 7,000rpm. Its 20.0Nm of torque is the highest here and it shows in the way of just how rapidly the FZ gets off the line, and in initial acceleration, it outpaces the NS200 and the RTR 200. Unfortunately, we had to test the bikes in a torrential downpour, so high-speed acceleration runs weren\xe2\x80\x99t really possible. But the FZ25 did clock the quickest 0-60kph time here of just 3.97sec. To top it off, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough torque available in the low range which makes for great ridability at low speeds in higher gears \xe2\x80\x93 a big help during the urban crawl. And this is the only engine amongst these three that\xe2\x80\x99s fuel injected, which gives it quick and precise throttle response at the merest twist of your right wrist. But even though this FZ is powered by a quarter-litre motor, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect too much top-end performance. In our tests, maintaining speeds of 100-110kph was no issue at all. However, it does feel like it quickly loses steam beyond that. Having a sixth cog in its five-speed gearbox would\xe2\x80\x99ve really helped it maintain higher speeds without feeling stressed._line_The only properly liquid cooled motor here is that from the NS200 \xe2\x80\x93 a 199.5cc single-cylinder unit. Combined with a four-valve head with three spark plugs helps it make the most power \xe2\x80\x93 23.5hp to be precise \xe2\x80\x93 and that gives it a fairly strong pull at the top end. But with only 18.3Nm of torque on tap, you really need to build up the revs for this Pulsar to start hauling quickly. Thankfully, throttle response is snappy and the short-stroke motor loves to rev. In the same rainy conditions, the Pulsar NS200 managed 0-60kph in 4.55sec. To be honest, while the NS should be a bit slower to 60kph than the other two, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be this slow. We believe there was something off about our test bike, and ideally would like to put another Pulsar through its paces for a more accurate representation. That said, it does offer the strongest top-end performance of this trio. And then, thanks to the inclusion of a six-speed transmission, the motor can stay comparatively relaxed at higher speeds. The gearbox is slick for the most part, but during our testing, did miss a couple of shifts during hard acceleration runs. The real downside, though, are the NVH levels. When compared to both the FZ25 and the RTR 200, the Pulsar feels distinctly unrefined and there is some amount of vibration felt at pretty much any point in the rev range._line_Although we weren\xe2\x80\x99t really expecting it, the Apache RTR 200\xe2\x80\x99s engine was surprisingly the most fun of the lot. The air-cooled 197.75cc single-cylinder mill benefits from oil-cooling and its origins from racing development show in the way it loves to rev. Right from the bottom end, this four-valve motor is just rearing to go and is extremely responsive. It makes 20.5hp of peak power and 18.1Nm of peak torque, which is, at least on paper, the weakest of the bunch. But with better bottom-end grunt, the RTR 200 gets on the line quicker than the NS200. It was able to get to 60kph in nearly the same time as the FZ25, completing the run in 3.97sec. Just like the FZ though, the RTR gets only a five-speed gearbox. The ratios are well arranged for brisk acceleration, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly feel the need for another gear once you\xe2\x80\x99re past 110kph. One aspect of the RTR which really stood out, and one we really enjoyed, was the exhaust note. It\xe2\x80\x99s got a deep, bassy roar that\xe2\x80\x99ll have you opening the throttle at every opportunity just to get a chance to listen to the decibels rise._line_Three to tango_line_All three bikes are equipped with beefy, telescopic forks up front and with preload-adjustable monoshocks at the back. But where their setup differs dramatically is the choice of frame. The FZ has a conventional diamond-type frame whereas the RTR runs with a split double cradle which uses the engine as a stressed member. The Pulsar however has the most top-drawer frame of the lot \xe2\x80\x93 a proper big-bike inspired twin-spar perimeter chassis, which contributes massively to the solid stability the bike shows around bends. The FZ is very capable in this department too, and its handling too feels reminiscent of the original FZ16. Neither the FZ nor the Pulsar has razor-sharp turn-ins, but the Yamaha definitely feels slightly lazier than the NS200 when you pitch it into a corner._line_The Apache is a whole different ball game in this department. With the shortest wheelbase of the lot, it is super responsive to steering inputs and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not used to how quickly it turns, it can even feel a bit twitchy. On the first few corners I took on the RTR, I ended up steering in too much, had to straighten the bike and turn-in again to be on the right line. However, spend a little time figuring out how the RTR 200 handles, and the speed at which you can negotiate a series of bends feels almost magical. And while the MRF tyres on the FZ25 and the NS200 are very capable, the optional Pirelli rubber that the RTR comes with gets two thumbs up from our side._line_The suspension setup of the NS200 certainly feels like it favours handling rather than a cushy ride quality. It feels quite firm over sharp bumps but it\xe2\x80\x99s far from bone jarring. The FZ runs on the stiffer side too, and it certainly feels more adept at managing longer undulations rather than jagged, broken roads. Ride quality is another area where the RTR 200 really shines. While it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not a soft ride, it manages to feel supple at pretty much all but the sharpest bumps. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite an impressive feat of this Apache\xe2\x80\x99s suspension to offer this blend of sharp, controlled handling while maintaining such a degree of composure over bad roads._line_Choosing time_line_The Pulsar NS200 is a tried and tested formula that has worked for many riders for quite a few years now. It has the most \xe2\x80\x98big-bike feel\xe2\x80\x99 of the three from the saddle and that itself may be enough reason for many buyers to go the Bajaj way. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like performance and handling is a compromise in any way either. At Rs 96,749 (ex-showroom, Delhi) it\xe2\x80\x99s well-priced too. However, with the Pulsar, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to live with a \xe2\x80\x98vibrating\xe2\x80\x99 riding experience that has been endemic to the brand. The FZ25 on the other hand is a very refined bike and quick to boot. To be honest though, it\xe2\x80\x99s best enjoyed when riding less frantically. As a city bike or even a relaxed long distance machine, it makes a lot of sense. However, it does have a higher asking price of Rs 1,19,335 (ex-showroom, Delhi), though given Yamaha\xe2\x80\x99s bullet-proof reliability, it might work out the same as the others in the long run. As for the Apache RTR 200, it feels a little small from the saddle and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same bottom-end grunt as the FZ or the top end pull of the NS200. But it is without a doubt the most engaging to ride bike amongst these three. And it handles urban commuting duties well too. At Rs 92,915 (ex-showroom Delhi), it\xe2\x80\x99s significantly lighter on the pocket if you go for one equipped with TVS tyres. But we wholeheartedly recommend coughing up the extra Rs 5,000 for the Pirelli rubber. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth it!_line_To be very honest, even after spending so much time in the saddle, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to narrow down to one clear winner of the three. But the whole time on the shoot, and even after, every time we had to get on the bikes, we found ourselves inadvertently reaching for the keys of the Apache RTR 200.

S" In a competitive market to have many seller is always a good thing for buyers. Same is the case for private schools, either elite ones or low fee paying ones. I have been seeing a rapid increase in number of private schools in Manipur, though more than 90% of them are low fee paying schools. I would say there is lot more space for lot more schools across the country to fit in, including Manipur. Here I would talk more about Manipur's scenario. _line_ Private schools market is the only market in Manipur, my assumption, which is providing jobs to thousands of heads. Around 8 lakh unemployed which are mostly youths out of 27.22 lakh population in Manipur is quite an alarming figure. Therefore, proliferation of private schools is always welcomed business not only especially in Manipur but also across the country. _line_ The density of schools is quite less as compared to the total children population and based on what should be the teacher pupil ratio for a quality learning environment. The standard ratio in India is 1:30 as recommended by SSA norm, while 1:35 as by RtE Act (but 1:40 in especial category schools like JNVs). But, the jaw-dropping ratio in private schools is 1:50-60 on an average not only in Manipur but across the country. _line_ There is higher probability of more attentive teaching learning process when pupil per teacher is small. In the western countries it is less than 30 pupils per teacher. So, in the competitive market of educational services, this proliferation will create a better teacher pupil ratio when distributed. The distribution of children will happen only when each one of the competitor has higher degree of competition. The competition is obviously the quality of education being sold in the market. _line_ Quality of education for a school is the quality of education that provides to each and every child in a classroom. Private schools are finely works with market inertia. This inertia attracts bright students and momentum increases further and Mathew effect starts to play, brighter students become even brighter while slower become even slower. _line_ Thus, becomes an undemocratic learning environment, which is even a big topic and big issue in Indian schools education. This should not be the case for an ideal quality of school education. Each and every child has unique learning capacity and style which should be acknowledged by the instructor rather than imposing the same to all just as we see in jail. On Facebook, I have seen schools being compared as jail, which is very true. A school should incorporate these 'philosophies of learning' in order to be a unique. _line_ Generations grown up even since I am born, I see only one change in schools education in Manipur is that the change only in the number of schools. There is no change in the curriculum, there is no change in the teaching-learning infrastructure, and there is no change in pedagogy. All these are because there is no change in the people's understanding of what they have learnt in the last two decades. The same traditional pedagogy is prevailing. It is, no doubt, outdated now after 21st century instructional methods have already flew in. _line_ An app is developed everyday but we cannot design learning for kids for a better learning (a punch line from Educational Initiatives). There is no improvement in the conceptual formation in any subject, either in Mathematics, Language, Science or whatever. Elementary concepts are completely underestimated. No one is doing research on innovative or better concepts on how a division happens, how to better teach fractions, what are the different methods of reading, how to build a massive creativity, how to better teach Science, the higher order thinking and so on. You will not find much of these things in conventional B.Ed curriculum. The curriculum is outdated. _line_ The current generation that I see at Kindergarten level is extremely intelligent as compared to children of a decade back. The private schools are at all not fit to provide the quality of education that suit to their intelligence. [Indian ranking in PISA is top from the bottom while Singapore children are on top from the top. How is that happen?] _line_ Pushing children to score high somehow in board exams or to make maximum children in appear in top ranks in locally organized Mathematics or Science competitions (having understood about these sorts of assessments) will not serve the purpose of providing quality education. It is a deep understanding and innovation in concept building that a unique school should do in order to outshine in the market of educational services. _line_ Popular franchise schools (though, I call them money making schools) may fly in Manipur and may disrupt the local market of private schools for a short period, but what not to worry in the long run is that the State do not have the qualified teachers to sustain the legend of these school. In order to happen this, the whole mass would need to grow to that level of learning for some generations so to supply the required cohort of capable teachers. _line_ Compared with other State, as I witnessed, the teaching and learning quality in Govt. schools of Sarva Shiksha Abhiya in State like Rajasthan (a State I have best understanding about school education) is far better than private schools in Manipur, when Rajasthan school education is considered as one of the least performing State in the country. Leave alone for quality teaching-learning process in Govt. schools of Manipur when the private schools are much below. It is a need of the hour for the private schools to have qualified educators to run this business. The owners should not hesitate to invest on hiring such professionals. _line_ Every parent wants their children be enrolled in quality schools, as I defined above though debatable. All born same but turn out different just because of differential opportunities provided to each one. Every children has unique potential, should be provided same quality of education to all. This can happen only when each competitor honestly competes on providing quality education in the state. The future is bright for with just a tipping-point change. _line_ My view in this piece is not an endorsement for private school system, my view on comparison between private and public school education is titled School voucher for economically disadvantaged children: A policy alternative in Manipur. _line_"

S'Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a tech masochist with a passion for frustration and struggles, but somehow I always find myself volunteering for these sorts of experiments \xe2\x80\x93 the kind you never really expect to work out as advertized. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried replacing a PC with a Chromebook, an Android tablet and even an iPad. So when Samsung said the Galaxy Note 8, and the S8 before it, can be combined with DeX to \xe2\x80\x9cleave your computer behind\xe2\x80\x9d, I just had to find out if it\xe2\x80\x99s true._line_Thus I found myself packing my powerful gaming laptop away and putting the Samsung DeX through its paces. I spent a week doing all my computer work with it. Every single bit; from emails to photo editing. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to tell you whether I am happy to go back to a regular computer or not._line_What is Samsung DeX?_line_Let\xe2\x80\x99s start by getting you caught up with Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s new toy. The DeX Station is an optional $149.99 accessory that can harness the power of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 to offer a desktop-optimized version of Android. It comes with a couple of USB ports, a LAN port, USB Type-C for charging and an HDMI connection. Slide the top lid back and you will be presented with a USB Type-C male connector for docking your smartphone._line_Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve hooked the device to a monitor, keyboard and mouse, it becomes an Android PC. Of sorts. But don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake the experience for an over-sized Android one. The UI offers multi-window support, a PC-like dock, optimized shortcuts and access to every app/file/function within your smartphone. Pretty neat idea, but is it worth it? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out._line_Design & function_line_The DeX Station is simple and clean. Its minimal circular shape and slide-back lid make it a nice base for showcasing your smartphone, especially considering all cables and ports are hidden away in the back. Take some time setting it up and it will blend into any environment perfectly. This is great, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look at your phone at all when docked; the screen turns off and becomes inoperable._line_The downside? This thing is a station, as in stationary. Essentially, it turns your phone into a desktop computer, a device you would \xe2\x80\x9cleave behind\xe2\x80\x9d anyways. Sure, it might be a good alternative for those who currently carry around full PCs from place to place \xe2\x80\x93 but who does that?_line_And those who use laptops as a daily driver will actually lose portability rather than gain it, as the DeX dock needs to be hooked up to an outlet, monitor, keyboard and mouse to work. How often do you find those lying around in cafes? DeX is really only one small piece of a much larger equipment puzzle, pretty much torpedoing the benefit of its being small and portable. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s only really useful in one place with all its peripherals at hand, why not just use your regular PC?_line_That point aside, when you are setting DeX up, make sure you get your keyboard and mouse set up before anything else, especially if you will be using Bluetooth for any of your peripherals. Because you will have a hard time connecting these to your Galaxy S8 once the phone is docked, as the screen goes dead._line_Now, the story would be completely different if there was a laptop dock, but that is a whole other topic we can\xe2\x80\x99t get into here. As it currently stands, the DeX station will do just that\xe2\x80\xa6 stand. It is not for the mobile warrior. Hence, the only way I see this working is if the user can survive with only using a phone, but could still benefit from a PC-like experience when in reach of a monitor and PC peripherals (like at home). But we can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that is going to be the case for many users. Most folks with no real need for a full PC are hardly going to be buying into a smartphone-based PC replacement solution, which begs the question: who is DeX really targeted at?_line_Software_line_Assuming you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the leap of faith DeX requires, the execution isn\xe2\x80\x99t half bad. From processing to files and apps, the whole experience is powered by our Samsung Galaxy S8 or Note 8. This smartphone is the brain and guts, which means you would essentially be running Android 7.0 Nougat, at least until the better peripheral support of Android Oreo arrives. Now, this is not like using an over-sized tablet (that is no way to live, trust me). Instead, Samsung has optimized the UI to look and operate more like a PC would. Seems like no easy feat, right?_line_General UI_line_The main desktop looks much like Windows\xe2\x80\x99, automatically making most users feel at home. There are 3 main buttons in the bottom-left corner: All Apps, Recent Apps and Home. Next to them are a series of customizable pinned applications. Settings and notifications can be found in the lower-right corner of the screen._line_I mean, throw a search area in there and you pretty much have a Windows taskbar, right? The desktop area doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be empty either. You can throw commonly used apps in there (much like pinned programs)._line_App selection and optimization_line_If you are to replace a full PC operating system with a mobile one, I would say Android is your best bet. It can be customized to your will. But most importantly, the nearly three million Android applications available from the Google Play Store are at your full disposal._line_Now, how well do all these millions of apps function when you have to work with a mouse, no touch screen and a large computer monitor? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very different story to the small screen experience in your pocket, and the truth is it depends. Samsung did partner with some developers to get some applications optimized for DeX, but they are not many. The good news is that the majority of apps you\xe2\x80\x99d want to use with DeX are DeX-optimized though._line_The good news? Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint are in there! Those are definitely among the most popular apps and they work amazingly with DeX. You do need an Office 365 subscription to use them, though. I am also a fan of the Skype app, which was made to look much like the desktop version._line_It was also great being able to use Photo Editor MG, but I did prefer the regular Adobe Photoshop Lightroom app from the Google Play Store. It already works very well with tablets, which translates well to desktop mode in this case. This is not always the case, though, which takes us to the next topic \xe2\x80\x93 app discrepancies._line_Discrepancies and inconsistencies_line_Because most applications are optimized for mobile consumption and touch controls, things can get pretty awkward when trying to use them with DeX._line_Dragging and using gestures is very common in Android, but this becomes a very non-intuitive experience when using a large monitor and a mouse. Samsung made an effort to make this fact known; you will often get a notification saying \xe2\x80\x9csome functions in apps are not supported by Samsung DeX\xe2\x80\x9d. Then there are apps like Amazon Shopping, which straight up won\xe2\x80\x99t open._line_Because all apps are made differently, there are plenty of inconsistencies. I hate the fact that in some messaging apps you can press enter to send, while this is impossible with others (e.g. Facebook Messenger). Having to use your mouse every time you send a message is annoying as hell. It may seem like a small thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of small thing that\xe2\x80\x99s very noticeable in a desktop-like environment._line_There is also the size factor. Some apps could be turned to landscape mode, while others were restrained to portrait. Then you have to deal with the fact that most can\xe2\x80\x99t really be resized or expanded to full-screen mode. I found that it was much more convenient to use Chrome for all these services, which is what you would most likely do in a PC, anyways._line_Messing with browser windows and tabs worked great though. I was able to open multiple windows and organize them around my desktop in true multi-tasking manner. But though this was the best route, I can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly say it was a smooth ride either._line_The Android Chrome app automatically chooses mobile sites, and there is no way to default to desktop versions. Basically, every time you open a tab you will have to go into the settings and hit \xe2\x80\x9cRequest desktop site\xe2\x80\x9d. From then on, that tab will stick with full websites, but you will have to request a desktop site again for any new tabs. It\xe2\x80\x99s an inconvenience, but until there is an option to always request desktop sites you will pretty much have to deal with it._line_I also came across a few glitches. When using WordPress, for example, the whole page would resize when hovering over certain links. Sometimes I would have trouble scrolling (especially within Facebook). There were little things here and there. Not enough to exactly break the deal, but enough to become an annoyance. Again, for a non-PC user, these might be acceptable in a DeX-only world, but if you already have a PC or laptop laying around, you\xe2\x80\x99d be much more likely to just use that._line_Gaming and multimedia_line_Following the launch of the Galaxy Note 8, Samsung has introduced a few new features to the DeX experience. There\xe2\x80\x99s now a full screen option for a bunch more games and a selection of other applications. To activate it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be using Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s Game Launcher software, but once you\xe2\x80\x99re in you\xe2\x80\x99ll find games like Vainglory optimized for a traditional keyboard and mouse setup._line_Other multimedia tasks have received some upgrades too. On the app side, Lightroom photo editing software now works in fullscreen. Meeting and video conferencing customers using Zoom, Meeting, or BlueJeans can display an extra display to callers, which can be edited in real time._line_Regular phone functions_line_For all intents and purposes, your phone has officially become your computer with DeX. This leaves people wondering what is going to happen with regular phone functions? You have access to all your apps and services, so this means you get the same notifications and can react to them just as you would when using the actual smartphone._line_The one thing that is annoying is answering calls. The screen goes dead when docked, meaning you have to fumble between the phone and the desktop set-up to choose which answering method you prefer. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible to use physical speakers to make the call, or answer and then take the phone out of the dock. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for the Galaxy S8 to switch from DeX to phone mode; the conversation can start right away, even as the phone is switching. Alternatively, one can set up a headset for calls._line_Can you replace a PC with Samsung DeX?_line_So, can this little hub really take over your laptop or desktop PC tower? It certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t for everyone, but some people could get away with it. I will say one thing \xe2\x80\x93 I have tried to replace my PC with multiple mobile devices in the past and so far Samsung DeX has gotten the closest to accomplishing this._line_But that is not to say the experience is flawless. Remember: this is powered by a mobile device with software designed for smaller screens and touch displays. Regardless of how much Samsung tries to make the experience seamless, some things will get lost in the translation between mobile and stationary ecosystems. Things might change with Oreo to some degree, but that\xe2\x80\x99s still a ways off for Samsung._line_Using Android apps with DeX proved to be very inconsistent most of the time, and reliability is an important factor, but I believe Samsung did its best in this department._line_It\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to keep applications working smoothly when they are all made by different developers and for varying purposes. These are smartphone/tablet apps, after all. The few DeX-optimized apps available worked perfectly, though._line_My biggest gripe was definitely the lack of portability. You can\xe2\x80\x99t realistically use DeX on-the-go. For starters, it needs to be plugged to a wall socket. Then, you have to factor in the fact that it works with a monitor, keyboard and mouse._line_None of that makes me believe you can really \xe2\x80\x9cleave your computer behind\xe2\x80\x9d. The DeX station is, by design, the thing one would leave behind, not the thing that replaces it. Unless you plan on bringing your whole desktop set-up around. So until Starbucks starts providing DeX areas along with their overpriced coffee, DeX really only has a home or office-based scope._line_I could realistically only leave my real PC behind if I settled on using my phone for everything. While I do see some users taking advantage of this, most folks require more power from their desktops. People who use their mobile devices for literally everything could definitely benefit from large-screen desktop browsing and Word editing though. DeX could be great for this, and the fact that all your apps, services and files are in one device makes the transition as convenient as can be. But DeX replaces only a small fraction of what a PC offers._line_In short, Samsung DeX is not a PC replacement, it\xe2\x80\x99s a smartphone enhancement. So you better still plan on taking that laptop with you if you require some serious computing power._line_'

S'Cummins has beat Tesla to the punch in debuting an all-electric semi._line_Popular for its diesel engines, Cummins unveiled its next generation of energy-diverse products and technology solutions, headlined by the AEOS semi-truck. The fully-electric class 7 demonstration Urban Hauler Tractor, as the company calls it, runs on an electric motor and a 140-kWh battery pack. It is capable of hauling up to 44,000 pounds of cargo, but even with the 140-kWh battery pack, it has a 100-mile range. The company is looking at solar panels to extend the range of its semi-truck, and there\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility of adding extra packs to extend the distance to 300 miles._line_Still, this is a concept which means Cummins has time to further develop and match or beat whatever Tesla has in the works. Tesla hasn\xe2\x80\x99t revealed very many details on its semi-truck, but there have been reports the automaker is getting ready to test its self-driving features on roadways. Tesla is anticipating a 200- to 300-mile range with its offering._line_Meet AEOS. @Cummins first fully electric, zero emission truck. #cummins #innovation #trucking pic.twitter.com/P4FtiU1RnY_line_\xe2\x80\x94 Cummins Inc.

S'If Angelique De Leon looks familiar to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s because this 27-year-old beauty regularly competed in Binibining Pilipinas. Prior to joining the pageant world, however, Angelique wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as conscious about her unhealthy lifestyle. But she worked hard to overcome those poor habits to train to be a beauty queen._line_When did you officially commit to living better?_line_I was living a \xe2\x80\x9cyo-yo\xe2\x80\x9d lifestyle for three years before finally committing to a more sustainable one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried every possible way to try and lose weight fast. I was miserable. Like most girls, I wanted to be skinny, not necessarily healthy. I succumbed to unrealistic standards of beauty. And I risked my life for it. One night, I was home alone and I felt uncomfortable. I had a fever and I could barely walk or move. I was dehydrated and my joints felt brittle. I was 21 then, and was going through my first real heartbreak, but I wondered why I was doing this to myself. So my then-boyfriend could love and accept me?_line_My second wake-up call was during my first stint at Binibining Pilipinas in 2014. I was considered one of the \xe2\x80\x9cthick\xe2\x80\x9d girls during the screening process (even after I lost 30 pounds prior to that). My body type is far from the typical Filipina body; I\xe2\x80\x99m not petite and I have broad shoulders and wide hips. I was really insecure. Then I realized that I stood out because of how different my body was from the other girls\xe2\x80\x99. Fans started noticing my natural curves. There was no turning back; I accepted the responsibility of teaching other people to discover their inner sexiness._line_What was your diet like before? How did your eating habits change? _line_I ate and drank everything you put in front of me (and more). I used to eat nine cups of rice in one sitting and I\xe2\x80\x99d still be game for dessert afterwards. I drank soda, iced tea, and powdered juices. Everything changed when my nutritionist, Leigh Guda, and workout trainer, Reynaldo Domalsin of Maximus Den, came into the picture. They trained me for Binibining Pilipinas. They taught me that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about weight loss; it\xe2\x80\x99s about body-fat loss. You can weigh the same and still look different because of fat and muscle._line_Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about eating alternatives. I work for more than 12 hours a day; my schedule is very demanding. I mindfully choose what I put in my body. I have a different diet for when I\xe2\x80\x99m competing and for when I\xe2\x80\x99m at my day job._line_What kind of workouts did you do to lose weight?_line_I was scared to use the weights at the gym at first because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to look masculine, but my trainer made me realize that that\xe2\x80\x99s a common misconception among women. And there was no such thing as \xe2\x80\x9cleg day,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshoulder day,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccore day.\xe2\x80\x9d We did a lot of full-body workouts or super sets. My entire body was sore after every workout, and I loved it. I specifically asked them to create a routine for me that\xe2\x80\x99ll challenge me so badly that it would make me cry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry though. My fats did. When I first started training, I had 21 percent body fat. Two months later, it was down to 15 percent._line_Did you feel self-conscious while exercising?  _line_At first, I did. I was specifically self-conscious about my legs. I have big legs because of my genes. I did a lot of squats and butt exercises. You will only be self-conscious if you see your body as a weak entity. So what if I have stretch marks? Those are my battle scars from my weight loss. So what if I have cellulite? Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? You can do what you want to minimize them, as long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself at risk._line_How long did it take you to lose all the weight?_line_My starting weight was 180 pounds. I lost 30 pounds in three weeks, but it was due to depression. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat, and I locked myself inside my room. I gained 10 pounds after that when I decided to live my life without my ex-boyfriend. I worked on myself more. I slowly lost another 30 pounds in two years, not knowing that my weight loss would eventually lead me to the pageant world. When I joined, I weighed 130 pounds. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about being skinny; it\xe2\x80\x99s about being healthy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about losing weight; it\xe2\x80\x99s about gaining knowledge._line_'

S' Ganesha, the most loved of all gods, became the centre of a mass art exhibition, says A Paljor_line_ A part of what you see on the canvas was something I had decided upon earlier but when I started working on my canvas, I started borrowing ideas from different elements, from my surroundings and nature itself. I added patchwork and made it more abstract,\xe2\x80\x9d said artist Deepak Saini, who was a participant of the 45-minute live street art session that took place at Select Citywalk over the weekend._line_ The idea behind his artwork was to emphasise the concept of light, which Lord Ganesha is known for. \xe2\x80\x9cI used a combination of red, yellow and white to highlight the bright part while black and purple stood out in contrast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saini, who has done graffiti and used huge walls as his canvas in the past. Not surprisingly, working on a 4X4 canvas in the given time was not too tough a task._line_ Saini was one of the participants at the event where 10 artists were invited by Delhi Street Art to reinterpret Lord Ganesha on canvas in 45 minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cDelhi Street Art is primarily focussed on creating unique and innovative art works on public spaces \xe2\x80\x93 garbage cans, walls, flyovers, bridges, train stations, prisons, markets, army vehicles and others. Each of these efforts provides the artists with a new canvas to express themselves and interact with a completely new audience \xe2\x80\x93 many of whom have had limited opportunities to see artists live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yogesh Saini, founder of Delhi Street Art._line_ Another artist, Nisha, who is currently pursuing her bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in fine arts from Lalit Kala Maha Vidhyalaya (College of Art, Delhi) was at home for the 45-minute challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally, it was a fun activity more than a challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said._line_ Elaborating on her artwork, she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to paint the essence of Ganesh Chaturthi and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I decided to paint the face of Lord Ganesha.\xe2\x80\x9d She painted her Ganesha patch on a smooth background. _line_ Artist Rahul Chauhan pasted peacock feathers to reinterpret the elephant god. He conceptualised Ganesha as the epitome of godliness. \xe2\x80\x9cPeacock feathers are always placed on top. Likewise Ganesha is always looked up to by his followers. Hence I twinned the metaphors,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Chauhan who felt creativity was all about being immersive and the time constraint really did not matter._line_ Chauhan is looking forward to pursuing his Masters in London. But his inclination towards art started manifesting itself in his school years. \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoyed working on figurative paintings and anatomy. Though people always asked me to concentrate on my academics, I looked forward to various competitions which gave me a real boost,\xe2\x80\x9d said the budding artist._line_ Raj Kanojia, another participant, depicted Ganesha surrounded by additional elephants. \xe2\x80\x9cI compared Ganesha\xe2\x80\x99s face to a real elephant rather than following the trend of a porcelain perfect face with a unifying tone. Also, the additional elephants express the grandeur of his personality.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ Unlike other paintings, Kanojia\xe2\x80\x99s canvas is more an amalgamation of applied art and visual communication as he uses his background of a graphic designer. For the past four years he has been attached to Delhi Street Art._line_ Saini is an engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a degree in business from the US. I followed it up with consultancy work and then worked with some internet companies in California. But I was always interested in arts and in doing something more creative. The opportunity presented itself when I came back here. I wanted to do something different and instead of pursuing another profession or career, I started pursuing my passion.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ Delhi Street Art started nearly four years ago with him painting dustbins in Lodhi garden. The whole idea came when Saini returned to India after living overseas for few years and rued the absence of colour, creativity and public art in our urbanscapes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe decided to take a positive initiative, bringing in more colour, art and dignity in public spaces, be it dustbins or walls,\xe2\x80\x9d he added._line_ They have also done other innovations too. \xe2\x80\x9cFew years ago, we used army trucks and jeeps as a canvas for Kargil Day and last year we were at the train station in Narela. The idea is to let people engage more in public spaces and develop an idea of art, which is still mainly confined to galleries,\xe2\x80\x9d said the founder of Delhi Street Art._line_'

S'Scientists have developed an app that allows people to easily screen for pancreatic cancer and other diseases by just clicking a selfie. One of the earliest symptoms of pancreatic cancer, as well as other diseases, is jaundice, a yellow discolouration of the skin and eyes caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the blood, researchers said._line_The ability to detect signs of jaundice when bilirubin levels are minimally elevated - but before they are visible to the naked eye - could enable an entirely new screening programme for individuals at risk, they said. The BiliScreen app, developed by researchers at the University of Washington in the US, uses a smartphone camera, computer vision algorithms and machine learning tools to detect increased bilirubin levels in a person\'s sclera, or the white part of the eye._line_The team developed a computer vision system to automatically and effectively isolate the white parts of the eye, which is a valuable tool for medical diagnostics. The app then calculates the colour information from the sclera-based on the wavelengths of light that are being reflected and absorbed and correlates it with bilirubin levels using machine learning algorithms. To account for different lighting conditions, the team tested BiliScreen with two different accessories: paper glasses printed with coloured squares to help calibrate colour and a three dimensional (3D) printed box that blocks out ambient lighting._line_"Pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease with no effective screening right now," said Jim Taylor, professor at University of Washington. "Our goal is to have more people who are unfortunate enough to get pancreatic cancer to be fortunate enough to catch it in time to have surgery that gives them a better chance of survival," Taylor added. In an initial clinical study of 70 people, the BiliScreen app-used in conjunction with a 3D printed box that controls the eye\'s exposure to light-correctly identified cases of concern 89.7 per cent of the time, compared to the blood test currently used. _line_'

S'Luke Skywalker dons a darker robe instead of his usual light neutral ones in a new magazine cover promoting Star Wars: Episode VIII \xe2\x80\x93 The Last Jedi. Star Wars fans have now had their beloved franchise back in the business of making films since 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Star Wars: Episode VII \xe2\x80\x93 The Force Awakens, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see Mark Hamill back full-time in his iconic role in the storied space opera saga. Save for a final shot that showed him silently gazing at newbie Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she hands him his father\xe2\x80\x99s original lightsaber, Luke was offscreen and referenced by others only for the duration of The Force Awakens\xe2\x80\x98 runtime._line_This, of course, will change with The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s film will focus heavily on Luke, his life\xe2\x80\x99s journey and discoveries since we last saw him in Episode VI \xe2\x80\x93 Return of the Jedi, revealing more about exactly what drove him to live in self-imposed exile on the Planet Ach-To. Fans were baffled when Luke declared that the Jedi must end in the first trailer for The Last Jedi, further perpetuating theories about Luke having gone to the dark side. This new magazine cover doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily dispel that theory, either._line_Hamill as Luke is featured on the cover of the Hungarian magazine Mozim\xc3\xa1nia, which has now made its way online thanks to Twitter (see below). In the image, the Jedi Master sports an all-black ensemble consisting of a robe and a cape, while he himself is bathed in red light. The aesthetic brings to mind Dark Force users like Luke\xe2\x80\x99s own father Darth Vader and Luke\xe2\x80\x99s nephew/former padawan, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). It is definitely weird seeing Luke dressed in something other than the Jedi\xe2\x80\x99s signature neutral-tone robes._line_New image of Luke Skywalker in a Hungarian magazine @MakingStarWars @PrensaImperial @StarWarsNewsNet pic.twitter.com/LH43Plx3ir_line_\xe2\x80\x94 Leonardo J. Bonilla (@therealkzq) August 30, 2017 _line_It is important to note that this is not the first time Luke has donned black garb. He wore a black matching set in Episode VI \xe2\x80\x93 Return of the Jedi, only to formally reject the Dark Side of the Force by the end of the film. Whether something similar happens in The Last Jedi remains to be seen, of course. Hamill, himself, has admitted that he had a hard time coming to terms with the character trajectory that Johnson has given Luke \xe2\x80\x93 but in the end, he conceded to the story, which makes us believe that he is going through some things entirely new to the Star Wars mythos._line_At this point, Luke walking away from everything that he has gone through only to eventually fall to the Dark Side seems anticlimactic. It undermines all his earlier sacrifices to make sure that he stays on the rightful path for a Jedi. If anything, all the talk regarding the balance in the force in conjunction with the concept of the gray Jedi, seems to be more feasible at this point._line_On top of the long-awaited return of Luke to the thick of things, Star Wars: Episode VIII \xe2\x80\x93 The Last Jedi is also hotly anticipated because it will feature Carrie Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s last go-round as Leia Skywalker/Organa, following her tragic death late last year. Here is to hoping that the film gives fans the Skywalker twins reunion that they are clamoring for._line_Source: Twitter_line_ Key Release Dates _line_Star Wars 8/Star Wars: The Last Jedi release date: Dec 15, 2017_line_Untitled Han Solo Star Wars Anthology Film release date: May 25, 2018_line_Star Wars 9 / Star Wars: Episode IX release date: May 24, 2019_line_'

S'The GDP data for the lat quarter will be declared on August 31_line_ BENGALURU: India\'s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) likely accelerated to 6.6 per cent in the quarter just ended, but analysts polled by Reuters are sounding increasingly worried that confusion over a new goods and services tax will dampen activity in coming months. _line_ The forecast, from a survey of over 40 economists taken over the past week, compares with growth of 6.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, the slowest pace in two years. The range of forecasts was wide from 5.7 per cent to 7.2 per cent. _line_ It would leave Asia\'s third-largest economy behind China, which last reported growth of 6.9 per cent, but still among the world\'s top performing economies. _line_ Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s government surprised the country last November by scrapping high-value banknotes, wiping out about 86 per cent of cash in circulation, which crimped consumer demand in a predominantly cash-reliant economy. _line_ While the economy has clearly bounced back from the cash shock, forecasters in the latest Reuters poll said the pickup may be short-lived. The 6.6 per cent growth forecast is down from 6.9 per cent expected in a survey taken in July. _line_ Uncertainty over how smoothly the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be implemented remains large and tough to forecast. It was launched on July 1 to harmonise various value-added tax regimes across states in India to one national standard. _line_ It has primarily hit micro, small, and medium-sized businesses that were showing some signs of stabilisation before demonetisation and the launch of the GST, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Larson and Toubro Finance Holdings. _line_ "This, combined with the ongoing stresses in large corporates, will certainly drag down gross domestic product growth," said Nitsure. _line_ "Most of the policy moves or structural reforms introduced recently are more suited for normal or boom times rather than to the current phase of slowdown. Hence, they are accentuating the intensity of the downturn." _line_ Confusion among businesses over how to price their goods and services is partly responsible for a contraction in both India\'s manufacturing and service sector activity in July. Industrial production also fell. _line_ Factory activity is forecast to have remained in a rut in August, though may show some signs of recovery. The August Purchasing Managers\' Index (PMI) is forecast at 49.3 versus 47.9 in the previous month. Any number below 50 suggests contraction. _line_ The forecasts were also in a wide range from 47.8 to 51.9. _line_ The Reserve Bank of India earlier this month became the first major central bank in Asia to cut interest rates this year, using room provided by slumping inflation. But it kept the market guessing on whether there\'s more space for trimming. _line_'

S"Campigli began working for the magazine Letteratura. He met the Futurist painters Carlo Carra and Umberto Boccioni and began meeting with their circle in Milan. The Futurist magazine Lacerba published an article of his in 1914 under the then pseudonym Massimo Campigli. He was also hired as secretary to Renato Simone at the Corriere della Sera the same year._line_However, with the beginning of the First World War in Europe, Campigli was drafted into the army. He was taken prisoner in 1916 and imprisoned in Sigmundsherberg near Vienna. He escaped and managed to reach Moscow by way of Hungary, the Moldavian Republic, and the Ukraine in June 1917. He was just in time for the October Revolution, and at its outbreak, fled to Murmansk and from there to London._line_The End of the War and Move to Paris_line_Campigli returned to Milan at the end of the war, applied for and received Italian citizenship, and was acknowledged for military valor. His old workplace, the Corriere della Sera, sent him as foreign correspondent to Paris in 1919. _line_He had begun drawing during the war years, but his interest in art began to deepen after his move to Paris. He befriended the Italian artists Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Filippo de Pisis, and Alberto Savinio. He discovered ancient Egyptian art at the Louvre, and was deeply influenced by it. _line_Campigli exhibited his painting \xe2\x80\x9cThe Knife Grinder\xe2\x80\x9d at the Salon d\xe2\x80\x99Automne in 1921. Leonce Rosenberg, a well-known Parisian art dealer, acquired some of his paintings the following year. He had his first solo show in Rome at the Bragaglia Gallery a couple of years later. This period of Campigli\xe2\x80\x99s life was one of personal growth as an artist, and the forming of his personal style. _line_The Mature Years_line_The mid-1920s saw Campigli exhibiting widely across Europe. He was now earning enough to live off his art. He married the Romanian painter Magdalena Radulesco in December 1926. He gave up his job at the Corriere della Sera the following year to focus on painting._line_Campigli debuted at the Venice Biennial in 1928. He made a trip to Rome at the same time, resulting in a visit to the museum of the Villa Giulia that housed Etruscan art. He was profoundly moved by what he saw. The consequence was a dramatic change in his sensibility and style. _line_Along with his wife Magdalena, he journeyed to Romania, where he began painting women going about their daily lives and work in the fields. The paintings were exhibited at the Jeanne Bucher Gallery in Paris, and were a success. This led to further exhibitions elsewhere, including one-man shows in New York, Paris, and Milan, cementing his international reputation._line_A return to Milan in 1933 saw Campigli begin work on Mario Sironi\xe2\x80\x99s Mural Art Manifesto. He created many murals over the next decade, including \xe2\x80\x9cI Costruttori\xe2\x80\x9d for the League of Nations in Geneva. _line_His marriage with Magdalena Radulesco fell apart, and he married Giuditta Scalini, a sculptor, in 1939. She helped him create a fresco at the Palazzo Liviano during five months they spent in Padua. Meanwhile, the Second World War had begun in Europe, and the couple fled to the poet Diego Valeri\xe2\x80\x99s house in Venice. The war years were spent between Venice and Milan. They had a son, Nicholas, in the beginning of 1943._line_The Later Years_line_As an artist, the war years saw him developing his skills as a printmaker. He made 30 lithographs in 1942 that were printed by Piero Fornasetti. He collaborated with Fornasetti for the next six years on a number of projects. He continued, however, to make lithographs, collaborating with various publishing houses. _line_The family moved to Paris in 1949, and he exhibited at the Galerie de France. The next decade saw his work move towards something close to an Abstract style. The couple had moved to St. Tropez, and his wife Giuditta died in 1966 after a prolonged illness. A retrospective of his work was organized at the premises of the Palazzo Reale in Milan._line_Campigli passed away from a cardiac arrest in 1971._line_TIMELINE_line_1895 - Born in Berlin_line_1909 - Moves to Milan_line_1916-18 - Prisoner of War, deported to Hungary_line_1919 - Moves to Paris_line_1923 - First solo exhibition_line_1926 - Joins the \xe2\x80\x98Paris Italians\xe2\x80\x99 artist group_line_1933 - Moves to Milan_line_1951 - Moves to Rome_line_1963 - Moves to Saint-Tropez_line_1971 - Dies in Saint-Tropez_line_MAJOR EXHIBITIONS_line_1923 - Bragaglia Gallery, Rome _line_1928 - Venice Biennale, Venice_line_1929 - Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris_line_1931 - Milione Gallery, Milan_line_1948 - Venice Biennale, Venice_line_1967 - Palazzo Reale, Milan_line_2011 - Ateneum Art Museum, Helsinki_line_2013 - Imago Art Gallery, London_line_2015 - MAXXI National Museum of 21st Century Arts, Rome_line_MUSEUMS / COLLECTIONS_line_Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago_line_Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas_line_Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco _line_Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg_line_Museum of Modern Art, New York_line_National Gallery of Art, Washington DC_line_Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice_line_Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, Bilbao_line_Block Museum of Art, Illinois_line_Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland_line_Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art, London_line_Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin_line_Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Trento_line_National Gallery, Ljubljana) _line_Palazzo Montecitorio, Rome_line_Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia_line_State Museums of Florence, Florence_line_"

S'New Delhi, 11 March 2016. In a complete volte-face on her earlier stand on marital rape, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has said it cannot be "suitably applied in the Indian context" due to factors such as poverty, illiteracy and religious beliefs._line_Either the minister did not do her homework and failed to consider these factors back in June last year, when she called marital rape "unacceptable", or she has just decided to retract her stand for reasons best known to her._line_Earlier, Gandhi\'s view was that marital rape is condemnable, and stemmed from a man\'s need to assert power over a woman. In fact, she did not mince words during an interview with journalists in June last year when she said: "My opinion is that violence against women shouldn\'t be limited to violence by strangers. Very often a marital rape is not always about a man\'s need for sex; it is only about his need for power and subjugation. In such case, it should be treated with seriousness."_line_Replying to another question, Gandhi said the scheme for universalisation of women helpline has been approved for implementation through states/UTs from April 1 last year to provide 24-hour emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence both in public and private sphere, including in family, community and workplace._line_"All the states/UTs have been requested to submit the proposals in order to release funds. Funds have been sanctioned/released to 33 states/UTs for setting up Women Helpline," she said._line_The ministry has also conceptualised an idea of women welfare committee in all districts of the country, however, no such proposal has been formulated so far._line_'

S'Room to spare_line_Houston is home to over two million people, some 30,000 of which will be left homeless in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. It\xe2\x80\x99s also home to multiple major research institutions, many of which took heavy hits from the storm. Houston scientists study everything from cardiovascular disease to the movements of the planets, and after checking in on family and friends, some also checked in on their labs\xe2\x80\x94where water-damaged equipment, floods, and power outages mean losing ground on critical experiments, or losing them entirely._line_Following conversations with colleagues on Twitter, Tim Mosca, a neuroscientist at Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania, wanted to help researchers impacted by Harvey. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lab and I put up a message, just something very general: If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been displaced by Harvey let us know how we can help.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Things took off from there, Mosca says, with labs across the country mirroring the offer. March for Science Houston, an organization dedicated to science communication and public outreach, started compiling a document of labs with space and resources soon after. As of Wednesday, over 150 facilities have answered the call. On Twitter, offers continue to pour in._line_On the gulf coast in Port Aransas, the University of Texas Marine Science Institute was devastated by the storm. Brett Baker, a microbiologist at the institute, says that he\xe2\x80\x99s been overwhelmed by the number of people reaching out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting all these emails and messages offering places to live and lab space,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to put a positive spin on things. I told my students to take advantage of this, and go to a lab with people you want to learn from and collaborate with.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Baker\xe2\x80\x99s students are planning to join groups across the country, from Berkeley to Harvard. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been to see his lab yet, but he thinks at least one major piece of equipment\xe2\x80\x94a $25,000 computer\xe2\x80\x94appears to be safe. Baker is optimistic that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to recover a good portion of his lab\xe2\x80\x99s data. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do a lot of computational work,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been offered server spaces on all of these supercomputers around the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Baker plans to transfer his data to servers at Ohio State University._line_BethAnn McLaughlin, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt University, was one of the first to offer up her lab\xe2\x80\x94and space in her home\xe2\x80\x94to stranded researchers. She was in Nashville in 2010 when rain sent floodwaters through the city. Her lab was on the eighth floor, safe from the rising water, but loss of power to key equipment, like freezers, ruined experiments._line_\xe2\x80\x9cWe probably lost several months of work,\xe2\x80\x9d McLaughlin says. With that in mind, she threw her doors wide open. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone can come to my lab, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just squash them in like little sardines, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be great."_line_The National Institutes of Health, which funds scientific research, have mechanisms in place to help researchers dealing with disasters like Harvey, though they\xe2\x80\x99ll take longer to go into effect. On Monday, the NIH announced that it would be considering late applications and reports. McLaughlin said that the deadlines of applications for R01 grants, which help researchers set up their labs, will probably be pushed back. The NIH also has programs that provide additional money to existing grants to meet unanticipated needs, and those policies were used to help researchers who needed extra funding during recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Mosca says he anticipates the same programs will be available now._line_Despite the mechanisms in place to support scientists, and the outpouring of help from across the country, scientific research will take a beating in the weeks, months and years to come. The loss of data, lack of progress on experiments, and gaps between publications will hit newer researchers particularly hard, McLaughlin says. \xe2\x80\x9cSpending a year getting your personal and professional life back on track in a competitive environment is devastating,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\'t surprise me to see some scientists, particularly postdocs, leave science.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine recognized the risks these disasters pose to science last year, when they started work on a study on the impact of natural disasters on research. The results were published at the beginning of August, and highlighted the potential damage to scientific knowledge and economic progress. \xe2\x80\x9cThe academic biomedical research community should begin discussing how to prepare for the worst, as the worst clearly can happen,\xe2\x80\x9d says the report summary._line_But regardless of what happens in the next weeks and months, scientists in Texas are grateful for the support from the research community. \xe2\x80\x9cWith all the other crap we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with, it helps to know people have my back,\xe2\x80\x9d Baker says._line_'

Photo: Ruben Banerjee/Mint_line_Bengaluru: As rains bring respite to the parched city of Bengaluru, dengue fever has been on the rise. _line_From 2 January to 20 August, there were 4,807 reported cases of dengue in the city, which faces problems such as uncleared garbage and uncovered water storage and more recently, intermittent rains. _line_The state has so far reported a total of 6,374 cases, taking the total to over 11,181 cases (including Bengaluru) since January, according to Dr. B.G. Prakash Kumar, deputy director at the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). _line_According to the state health department, the epidemic occurs usually from April to November and during the pre- and post-monsoon periods. _line_The main cause of Dengue, according to the health department, is due to large scale breeding of Aedes Egypti mosquitoes in domestic and peri-domestic situations in water storage containers like cement water tanks, barrels, tyres, and such other containers which are usually not emptied for a long time in addition to discarded materials like coconut shells, tyres, plastic materials which collect rain water. _line_However, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)\xe2\x80\x94the city\xe2\x80\x99s civic body\xe2\x80\x94says that the percentage of dengue cases in Bengaluru in ratio with the population continues to be on the lower side. _line_Dr. M.N. Lokesh, chief health officer (public health) at the civic body, says that the higher numbers just shows higher reporting and better surveillance and not necessarily a rise in cases. _line_But there is no actual way to compare as the BBMP have started collating data from public and private hospitals only from this year. The only statistics available from last year, according to Lokesh, are the ones submitted to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and only those reported from government run establishments._line_The disease has claimed the lives of at least five people this year, data shows. _line_Adding to the troubles is the rise of other such communicable diseases like chikungunya, which like dengue, has been on the rise. _line_The state has reported around 1,400 cases of chikungunya from January till 28 August, data shows. Dr. Kumar says that the department has been actively pursuing efforts of source reduction and awareness programmes across the state._line_But private citizens paint another picture. _line_Meenakshi Bharat, an environmentalist and medical practitioner, says that the BBMP does not have the capability or the ability to deal with the problem. \xe2\x80\x9cDumping of garbage is a big problem as rain water accumulates there. The mosquitoes will find the water and breed within two days,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. _line_Bengaluru produces over 4,000 metric tonnes of garbage with most of it lying on roads. Dengue cases have been on the rise for at least a decade now and the civic authorities are still not able to reduce breeding grounds._line_'

S'Space abstraction. Credit: MIPT\'s Press Office_line_A team of scientists from Russia and Canada has analyzed the effect of space conditions on the protein composition in blood samples of 18 Russian cosmonauts. The results indicate many significant changes in the human body are caused by space flight. These changes are intended to help the body adapt and take place in all major types of human cells, tissues and organs. The results of the research have been published in the prestigious scientific journal Scientific Reports. Skoltech and MIPT Professor Evgeny Nikolaev led the study and is a corresponding author. _line_The effects of spaceflight on the human body have been studied actively since the mid-20th century. It is widely known that space conditions influence metabolism, thermoregulation, heart biorhythms, muscle tone, the respiratory system and other physiological aspects of the human body. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these physiological changes remain unknown._line_The scientists focused on proteins, key players in the adaptive processes in an organism. To gain a deeper understanding of the changes in human physiology during space travel, the research team quantified concentrations of 125 proteins in the blood plasma of 18 Russian cosmonauts who had been on long-duration missions to the International Space Station. The blood was drawn 30 days prior to their flights, and again immediately after their return to Earth, and a final sample seven days after that. This timing was chosen to identify trends in protein concentration changes and see how fast the protein concentrations returned to their normal levels prior to the flight._line_Protein concentrations were measured using a mass spectrometer. This technology makes it possible to identify a particular molecule and perform a quantitative analysis of a mixture of substances. The scientists found proteins whose concentrations remained unchanged, as well as those whose concentrations did change, but recovered rapidly to their pre-flight levels, and those whose levels recovered very slowly after the cosmonaut\'s return to Earth._line_"For the research, we took a set of proteins\xe2\x80\x94non-infectious disease biomarkers. The results showed that in weightlessness, the immune system acts like it does when the body is infected, because the human body doesn\'t know what to do and tries to turn on all possible defense systems. For this study, we began by using quantitative proteomics to study the cosmonauts\' blood indicators, so we detected not only the presence of a protein but its amount, as well. We plan to use a targeted approach in the future to detect more specific proteins responsible for the human response to space conditions. To do this, the cosmonauts will have to take blood tests while in orbit," said Professor Nikolaev._line_The factors that affect the human body during spaceflight are different from those that influence human evolution on Earth. It is not known if the human body has mechanisms responsible for rapidly adapting to such major changes. The results of the study indicate that such mechanisms probably do not exist, because during space flight, these adaptations take place in all the major types of human cells, tissues, and organs. This indicates that the human body does not know what to do and is trying to do everything in its power. _line_More information: Irina M. Larina et al.

In the forthcoming weeks, I will highlight more edupreneur voices in a short series._line_Top Five Edupreneur Voices_line_Angela Maiers, Founder, Choose2Matter_line_1. Angela Maiers_line_Angela Maiers has been creating and leading change in education and enterprise for 31 years, teaching every level of school from grade school to graduate school, and consulting with organizations and companies around the world. As a young teacher, she had an epiphany that people need to know they matter. They need to be noticed, valued, and honored. She states, \xe2\x80\x9cSignificance is even more important than success.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_In 2012, she founded Choose2Matter, a movement that challenges all \xe2\x80\x93 to not only to believe and know they matter, but also to make \xe2\x80\x9cmattering\xe2\x80\x9d a way of life. She now spends her time helping students, teachers, parents, and leaders embrace and embody this message in their own lives and in the lives of those they lead and serve._line_Today,  Choose2Matter reaches over 1 million students in 65,000 classrooms in more than 50 countries. Countries that feature her work include Canada, Australia, UK, Africa, and the United States. She\xe2\x80\x99s also authored several books and instructional guides, including her latest set of lessons: \xe2\x80\x9cGenius Matters.\xe2\x80\x9d Her organization has attracted sponsors and goodwill partners, including SMART Technologies, IBM, The Girls Scouts of America, and the USO, who help make it possible to sustain not only the message of mattering but facilitate the epic shifts in culture and community that the work requires._line_Why you should follow Maiers_line_Maiers does the work that many thought-leaders discuss. Choose2Matter inspires individuals to act, to do, and to be brave. Maiers is the ambassador to their stories, recording and sharing what she sees. Her ability to invite, connect and empower others and to unleash their contributions is the reason she gets up every morning._line_Choose2Matter was born out of a single profound belief that you are a genius and the world needs (not wants or desires) your contribution. Maiers states, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not an ideology; this is biology. Mattering is an essential need.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Although the message was originally intended for teachers and students, her movement has grown. Her message is discussed among military leaders, business executives, and even, in recent months, members of Parliament._line_What makes this accomplishment even more profound than the sheer numbers of students involved is that they are doing the work within the confines of the school day in what she calls: Genius Hour. Google\xe2\x80\x99s 20% time inspired Genius Hour, where young people are given one hour a week to come together to leverage their collective genius to change our world._line_Maiers states, \xe2\x80\x9cEntrepreneurship is driven by the innate need to create, build, grow and impact. When we connect the two, education and entrepreneurship, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about taking control of your journey to spend your life using your strengths and genius to make an impact.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_She continues, \xe2\x80\x9cMattering and entrepreneurship both represent freedom, courage, possibilities and allow a person to tap into their gifts. To nurture and lead entrepreneurs, we have to approach it as an inside out task. We present Choose2Matter as a path to purpose and teach young entrepreneurs to conquer their world \xe2\x80\x93 before they conquer the world.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Maiers\xe2\x80\x99 advice for potential edupreneurs: Share your story_line_Share your entrepreneurial story; let people see how you came up with an idea, and how you shifted to another, and failed, and iterated until you finally found what you were meant to do all along. It\xe2\x80\x99s the process, not the product that matters most to the learner. Be brave. You were born to make an impact. Do it._line_Where to follow Angela Maiers_line_On Twitter @angelamaiers, angelamaiers.com and Choose2Matter.org_line_ 2. Vicki A. Davis_line_Vicki A. Davis, Teacher and Edupreneur_line_Vicki A.

My blog post resulted in a phone call with Google.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Why you should follow Davis_line_Davis is on top of the \xe2\x80\x9cleading bleeding edge\xe2\x80\x9d of technology.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that most business people truly understand the classroom. Just because you were a student in a classroom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you truly understand classrooms.\xe2\x80\x9d She continues, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were one student who learned one way. And your way of learning is not every child\xe2\x80\x99s way of learning. So be careful to think your experience is that of everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Davis also believes that edupreneurs who believe they can \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d classroom problems with their app and commission research studies must understand they face one big flaw: No research study can control the excitement of a teacher. Davis states, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a teacher gets excited, the classroom gets excited. And when others notice, study and pay attention to teachers, they get excited.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Where to follow Davis_line_ 3.

McLeod claims, \xe2\x80\x9cThe world outside of schools is changing much faster than the world inside of schools. This innovation gap will be the defining story of P-12 schools over the next few decades.

We now have numerous examples of classroom educators, principals, media specialists, technology integrationists, and other educators who have initiated innovations within their local classrooms, building, or school systems. By sharing their work publicly, they have found a multitude of ways to share and scale that work through blogs, Twitter, and other social media channels._line_Some of those innovations have even resulted in published books, commercial products, or full-blown companies. These educators are models for the rest of us. If the desire and sweat equity are both there, amazing things are possible._line_ Find your network. The people who care about and are interested in furthering your initiative are out there. Social media makes it fairly easy to find them. Once you are a trusted voice and a valued contributor to relevant communities, then you can start leveraging those connections and shared idea spaces to move forward. There are no quick and easy paths to success, but people are willing to help you if you\xe2\x80\x99re authentic, and if you create more value than you consume._line_Where to follow McLeod_line_ 4. Will Richardson_line_Will Richardson, Change School_line_Will Richardson spent 21 years as a high school English teacher in a public school, and he was also a technology administrator for three years._line_Today, you will find Richardson at Change School. At Change School, they want to build the capacity of every educational leader around the world to imagine, design and implement a process for profound, relevant, sustainable change in their schools and communities. They seek to do that through a powerful combination of coaching and community both driven by personal inquiry and passion. Richardson states, \xe2\x80\x9cDiscussions around change become more effective when participants share a common language around learning, an understanding of the new technological and global contexts which impact the work of schools, and a community of support and care that reduces the sense of isolation that many leaders currently feel.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Why you should follow Richardson_line_Through his work, Richardson is getting thousands of educators to consider the constructionist aspects of Web technologies in their classrooms. Getting people to think about why there is an obvious gap between what they believe around learning and what they do in schools._line_Richardson states, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fairly successful at connecting common sense thinking about learning to the new, globally connected, technology-rich learning environment we now find ourselves in, and communicating that in thoughtful, compelling ways to educators and parents.\xe2\x80\x9d He continues, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom a Change School perspective, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve created a unique opportunity for educational leaders to challenge themselves and level up regarding their own leadership and their understanding of the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s been an amazing learning experience for all of us.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_And, they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing the school change conversation to a higher level, infusing it with an urgency that is built both on common sense and a deep understanding of how the Web and other technologies are fundamentally challenging traditional systems, structures, practices, and mindsets about school. Their work focuses on moving existing, traditional schools to a different place, not on building new schools that are different._line_Richardson claims, \xe2\x80\x9cThe agency that modern learners now have to learn what they want, when they want, with whom they want, and wherever they choose is the single most significant and disruptive development in the history of education.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s advice for potential edupreneurs: Think differently_line_Educators need to think differently about education and schooling, but the key is to focus on increasing student agency over learning rather than an emphasis on improving teaching. Too much of what I see on various vendor floors or online aims at making current practice \xe2\x80\x9cbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly about finding easy ways to increase a narrowly defined goal of \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d in a very traditional sense._line_We need to break with tradition, tell more modern stories, and build the capacity of everyone engaged in the work to reimagine the role and value of schools and classrooms.

S'Fifty years ago, The Fugitive stopped running._line_The end of the pursuit also gave TV its first lesson in figuring out how to say goodbye._line_The ABC series starring David Janssen as Richard Kimble, the physician wrongly convicted of killing his wife, was one of the best-loved of the 1960s and the basis of the hit 1993 theatrical feature featuring Harrison Ford as well as a short-lived CBS remake in 2000 starring Tim Daly and Mykelti Williamson._line_Kimble adopted aliases and took on menial jobs while eluding Lieutenant Philip Gerard (Barry Morse), the obsessed detective he\'d escaped en route to his execution._line_Before the finale of The Fugitive, watched by a then-record audience of 78 million viewers on August 29, 1967, there had never been a big planned send-off to a popular network TV show that provided a massive communal experience for fans._line_And therein lies a tale._line_ For four seasons, The Fugitive found the hunted Kimble fleeing to a different place each week, adopting aliases and taking on menial jobs while eluding Lieutenant Philip Gerard (Barry Morse), the obsessed detective from who Kimble escaped en route to his execution._line_ Kimble was also hell-bent on proving that Fred Johnson (William Raisch), the mysterious one-armed man he saw leaving his home on the night his wife Helen was murdered, was the culprit._line_David Janssen in the television series, The Fugitive._line_The role of Kimble made Janssen one of TV\'s biggest stars. He was on-screen nearly every minute, often in fight scenes and frequently on the run._line_Even though the show was one of ABC\'s most popular - scoring an outstanding drama series Emmy in 1966 - the actor made it known in the fourth season that he had had enough of the drama\'s gruelling production schedule and desired a film career._line_ Once ABC announced in winter 1967 that The Fugitive was in its final season, Leonard Goldberg, a network programming executive at the time, remembered how friends would ask him how Kimble\'s journey would wrap up._line_ "I said, \'Well, it\'s going to end - it will be over like all other television shows,\'" recalled Goldberg, currently the executive producer of Blue Bloods on CBS. "We hadn\'t planned on ending it."_line_Ed Robertson, author of The Fugitive Recaptured, said the show\'s creator, Roy Huggins, envisioned a conclusion to the cat-and-mouse triangle of Kimble, Gerard and Johnson._line_For four seasons, The Fugitive found the hunted Kimble fleeing to a different place each week._line_But Huggins was not involved in the show beyond selling the idea. There was no road map for resolution. Other long-running series of the time simply went away quietly without tying up loose ends._line_ Even with its recurring stories involving Gerard, the one-armed man and Kimble\'s family, The Fugitive was not a serialised drama. The formula was primarily self-contained stories. Continuity was a low priority - many actors cast as guest stars appeared many times in different roles._line_ Goldberg remembers hearing from his ABC bosses that the audience had no interest in how Kimble\'s personal story ended._line_But he argued that fans had become emotionally involved with the overarching plot lines. Young viewers in the turbulent 1960s were attracted to the anti-establishment undertones in Kimble\'s continued evasion of law enforcement - a device that one ABC executive had believed was "un-American" when the show was first pitched._line_Said Goldberg, "\'I said, \'Our viewers invested four years with Richard Kimble. He\'s become real to them. And they want to know what happens to him\'."_line_A network programming executive remembers friends would ask him how Kimble\'s journey would wrap up. "It will be over like all other television shows...We hadn\'t planned on ending it."_line_Complicating the situation were business concerns over how a resolution to the story would damage the market for repeats and syndication._line_Quinn Martin, the producer of the series, was already seeing $500,000 a year go away with its cancellation. He was counting on a bounty from the sale of episodes to local TV stations._line_The Fugitive, which aired in 69 countries, was also ABC\'s most popular and lucrative property overseas. (Janssen said he was frequently quizzed about Kimble wherever he went on vacation in Europe.)_line_ Martin ultimately agreed that fans deserved a finale, and a script was quickly written. But the network, wanting to make sure ratings for repeats would hold up over the summer, waited to air the two-part story, titled The Judgment, in the last two weeks of August._line_ Goldberg also believed the farewell would help promote ABC\'s fall lineup._line_ In the episodes, Gerard learns of the arrest of Johnson for an assault he committed in a Los Angeles topless bar. A news wire service story about the crime is planted, luring the on-the-lam Kimble to police headquarters, where Johnson is being held (much of the episode\'s location work was filmed in downtown Los Angeles)._line_Only the fate of JR Ewing was more of a lure to audiences than that of Kimble._line_But a witness to Helen Kimble\'s murder - a panicked war hero neighbour too ashamed to come forward after failing to help her - secretly posts bail for Johnson._line_That development eventually leads to a chase back to the scene of the crime in Kimble\'s Indiana hometown, and the good doctor is eventually exonerated after a dramatic, western-style showdown filmed in the former Pacific Ocean Park at the Santa Monica Pier._line_Diane Baker remembers her role as a young paralegal who discovers Gerard\'s ruse and saves Kimble from turning himself in before the new witness can be identified._line_Friends ended witha two hour finale episode , giving fans the closure they\'d need._line_"I loved the idea of me getting to come into a series at the end and that it would be so special," said Baker, executive director of the acting school at San Francisco\'s Academy of Art University. "It was always a joy to work with an instinctive actor, and that\'s what David was."_line_Baker was out of the country when Part 2 of The Judgment aired. But she learned quickly of its impact while in Madrid for the filming of Krakatoa: East of Java with Maximilian Schell. Spanish journalists besieged her at the location shouting, "El fugitivo! El fugitivo!"_line_"The day the running stopped," as the show\'s omniscient narrator, William Conrad, described it, had become world news._line_When Game of Thrones ends, fans will be seeking satisfaction and debates will rage. (Cue up the ongoing furor over the conclusion of Lost.)_line_Part 2 of The Judgment was seen in 72 percent of the homes using television on the night it aired against scant competition on CBS and NBC._line_The audience size remained a Nielsen record until November 1980, when it was topped by the "Who Shot JR?" episode of Dallas._line_In the pre-Internet era of 1967, there was no online obsessing or major spoilers revealed about the ending._line_Janssen was known for joking that The Fugitive would conclude with Kimble relaxing on a desert island and removing a prosthetic arm, showing that he had murdered Helen. ("I killed her, Joey - she talked too much," Janssen cracked to ABC late-night talk-show host Joey Bishop.)_line_The actual reveal was kept under wraps under Martin\'s orders. ABC did not provide a screening of the finale for TV critics._line_"The media didn\'t understand how important it was to the viewers," said Goldberg. "Had they realised it was going to be this enormous of an event, I think they would have done a better job of finding out what the ending was going to be."_line_Some journalists were not impressed._line_"Hardly worth waiting four years for," Variety wrote. New York Post TV columnist Bob Williams quaintly described ABC as "greedy" for holding the episodes until the summer repeats had finished. But the staggering Nielsen ratings validated the decision._line_Fears the climax would doom the aftermarket for The Fugitive proved unrealised. Reruns of the series remained popular through the decades that followed on such stations as KDOC in Los Angeles and A&E, which ran the series in the 1990s._line_The popularity of The Judgment meant hit TV shows were no longer destined to fade quietly._line_Series finales became pop culture celebrations. The final episode of the beloved sitcom MASH was watched by 106 million viewers on February 28, 1983, a record that stood for 27 years, until Super Bowl XLIV surpassed it in 2010._line_NBC turned its send-offs of Cheers, Seinfeld and Friends into two-hour events, scoring massive audiences._line_Like everything in the current TV landscape where viewers have myriad programme choices, series finales are not as big as they used to be._line_"The \'Must See TV\' comedies were still extremely popular when they ended," said Preston Beckman, an NBC executive in the 1990s who is now a consultant._line_"What\'s happened over the last few years is that networks hold on to shows two or three years longer than they should."_line_But when ongoing TV sagas such as The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones are finally resolved, fans in large numbers will be seeking satisfaction and debates will rage. (Cue up the ongoing furor over the conclusion of Lost.)_line_As The Fugitive first proved 50 years ago, people care.\xe2\x80\x8b_line_'

He lives and works between his hometown of Merano and New York City. _line_Early Life_line_Rudolf Stingel was born in the commune town of Merano in northern Italy in 1956. His art began receiving notice from international audiences towards the latter half of the 1980s, when he began experimenting with monochromatic pieces for the first time, covering undertones of primary colors with a veneer of silver. He was known to hold particularly anti-establishment ideals, first displayed at the 1989 Venice Biennale when he distributed a series of illustrated do-it-yourself manuals in English, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and French listing the equipment and procedure involved to create one of his paintings. The act implied that anyone at all could create a piece of art by simply following the instructions._line_1990s_line_Stingel began work on his radiator sculptures in the early 1990s, pouring orange acrylic paint into translucent resin during the process of casting to create a patterned ember-glow that successfully distanced the viewer from the utilitarian aspect of the object. It triggered in him a need to explore the relationship between an artwork and the environment surrounding it and he started constructing installations that covered the floors, ceilings and walls of a gallery with black and white carpets, essentially turning the very architecture into a painting. In 1993, Stingel participated in the Venice Biennale by showcasing a vast, lavish orange carpet glued to the wall. _line_2000s_line_He became more ambitious in the scale of his projects in 2004, covering the entirety of the Vanderbilt Hall at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Central Terminal with industrially printed floral carpeting, a procedure that was repeated at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. The piece was titled \xe2\x80\x9cPlan B.\xe2\x80\x9d Concurrently, Stingel mounted a similar installation in the Museum fur Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt am Main using red and silver insulation panels marked with motifs from traditional damask wallpaper. _line_In 2005, he started work on a series of paintings based on photographic portraits taken by other visual artists such as Sam Samore and Robert Mapplethorpe. In 2007, a mid-career retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago followed by another at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In both, he encouraged the audience to draw or write on the surface of the reflective panels that covered the room, letting the viewer share the privilege of the artist and thereby painted collectively amongst strangers. The shows were critically acclaimed, resulting in a discernible increase in Stingel\xe2\x80\x99s market value, with a big Styrofoam board selling for almost $2 million. _line_Most recently, \xe2\x80\x9cRudolf Stingel LIVE\xe2\x80\x9d debuted at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin in 2010, a collection of enormous landscapes based on vintage photographs of the Alpine town of Merano.

S'New Delhi, 9 Dec. Central Water Commission (CWC) under Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will set up 40 flood forecasting stations for the first time in the States of Arunachal Pradesh (3), Himachal Pradesh (1), Kerala (2), Rajasthan (12), Sikkim (8) and Tamil Nadu (14) during the current five year plan. In addition to this 60 more flood forecasting stations will be set up in other States already having flood forecasting stations to cover their uncovered areas._line_Central Water Commission (CWC) has, inter-alia, been entrusted with flood forecasting activities in India. For this purpose, a network of 878 stations on major rivers and their tributaries has been set up. Presently, flood forecasts are issued for 176 stations (148 level forecast and 28 inflow forecast) using hydrological data from its own network and Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) received from Flood Metrological Organization (FMO) of India Metrological Department (IMD).

S' (Natural News) A recent study showed that the husk of an avocado seed is the healthiest part of the fruit as it contains a vast number of key nutrients that show potential in alleviating cancer, heart disease, and other diseases._line_As part of the study, a team of researchers at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley ground about 300 dried avocado seed husks into 21 ounces of powder. The powder produced three teaspoons of seed husk oil and slightly more than an ounce of seed husk wax following an additional process._line_The experts were able to identify 116 compounds in the oil and 16 in the wax. Among the oil\xe2\x80\x99s components included heptacosane, a compound known to mitigate tumor cell growth. The team also found that the oil contained dodecanoic acid, which helped increase good cholesterol levels and reduced the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attacks and, strokes._line_Likewise, the scientists detected traces of docosanol in the husk oil. The compound is the primary ingredient in manufacturing antiviral drugs for the treatment of cold sores or fever blisters. The experts also noted that the wax contained a vast number of compounds such as butylated hydroxytoluene, an antioxidant food additive and preservative commonly used in cosmetics._line_Researchers said they will alter several of the natural compounds found in the husk to develop better drugs with fewer side effects._line_\xe2\x80\x9cIt could very well be that avocado seed husks, which most people consider as the waste of wastes, are actually the gem of gems because the medicinal compounds within them could eventually be used to treat cancer, heart disease and other conditions. Our results also suggest that the seed husks are a potential source of chemicals used in plastics and other industrial products,\xe2\x80\x9d researcher Dr. Debasish Bandyopadhyay told the Daily Mail online._line_The results were presented at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington, D.C._line_Potential implications in cancer, heart disease management_line_The recent findings may very well show potential in addressing and preventing the onset of cancer and heart disease, both of which remain to be the leading causes of death worldwide._line_According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains to be the leading cause of death around the world, killing more people than any other causes. Data from a WHO fact sheet revealed that CVD accounted for nearly 18 million global deaths in 2015 alone. This rate equated to 31 percent of all deaths worldwide._line_The fact sheet also showed that 7.4 million of these deaths were associated with coronary heart disease, while 6.7 million were due to stroke. More than three quarters of all CVD-related deaths around the world occurred in low- and middle-income countries._line_Heart disease can be mitigated by addressing risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet, obesity, and lack of exercise._line_In another WHO fact sheet, cancer was recognized as the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the globe.

S"No matter how intense your beauty regimen is, bacne can flare up at any time. But that shouldn't make you pack away your cute backless shirts and dresses. Once you take a look at what's causing those out-of-sight, out-of mind pimples, you can avoid fighting an uphill breakout battle. Understanding these triggers is one way to end the struggles of body acne and keep your time in sheer apparel totally carefree. _line_Fortunately, eliminating these factors will be no sweat off your back. These seven habits will promote healthy, flawless skin on every part of your body._line_ Sleep on Clean Sheets _line_You should be changing your sheets at least once a week to avoid snuggling up in oil and dirt. Since movement in your sleep puts pressure on your skin that leads to friction, you want linen to be clean and bacteria-free. I recommend making your own DIY linen spray with germ-fighting essential oils, vodka, and vinegar or spritzing Caldrea Lavender Spray ($10) on your sheets between washes. _line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Diggy Lloyd_line_ Get the Benefits of Sweat Without the Negatives _line_Your sweat is a concoction of oil, dead skins cells, and bacteria that clogs pores. That's why it's essential to shower after a particularly raunchy day. The good news is that perspiring is a great way to purge bacteria from your pores, but make sure that you rinse those impurities away so it's not reabsorbed through the skin. If you can't get to a shower right after exercising, don't fret \xe2\x80\x94 just stash an oil-controlling body spray like this Etsy Toning Mist ($18) in your gym bag for post-workout touch-ups. _line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Benjamin Stone_line_ Save the Heavy Moisturizers For Winter _line_Heavy butters are great for combating dry skin in the Winter, but during warmer months, you should swap the lotion for a lighter moisturizer like Rad Soap Co.'s Chaga Face Cream ($35). If you typically apply sun protection on top of a moisturizer, consider gentle creams that have additional SPF protection like Andalou Naturals Ultra Sheer Daily Defense Facial Lotion ($15). _line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Sheila Gim_line_ Exfoliate Weekly _line_Exfoliating is a popular way to relieve bacne, but it's also a preventative measure as well because it sloughs off dead cells and makes room for healthy, strong skin. This should be a biweekly practice because exfoliating too often can irritate the skin. _line_Since back skin isn't usually as sensitive as what's on your face, treat yourself to a hearty body scrub like Shea Moisture's Omega 3, 6, 9 Rescue Hand & Body Scrub ($10) to slough off dead skin and debris. This exfoliator is great for dry or sensitive skin._line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Benjamin Stone_line_ Get Your Steam On _line_The heat from a steaming shower can help open your pores before you apply body wash. A mild steam treatment works to soften and draw blackheads up from the surface and to help flush out excess oil. Just don't steam for too long \xe2\x80\x94 a maximum of 15 minutes is recommended. _line_Depending on where you live, hard water might flow out of your pipes. Your state's water testing records are part of the public record, so you can check them online. If you find that your water supply includes impurities such as chlorine or radon, you should consider investing in a stabilizing Shower Water Filter ($20)._line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Julia Sperling_line_ Protect Your Back From Your Hair _line_Many of us produce more oil when it's warm because the heat increases oil production in our sebum glands. If you feed your dry hair heavy treatments, excess oil in that product can lead to bacne when your strands touch your skin. Stay away from silicones and sulfates in your haircare products, and stick with gentle brands like Aubrey Organics. _line_Keep your hair tilted while you wash and condition your mane. This keeps it off your body, which protects your back. After you shower, style with a towel to avoid any drippage from damp strands. My secret is using the same moisturizing agent on my hair that I do my face \xe2\x80\x94 coconut oil will hydrate both._line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Benjamin Stone_line_ Wear Loose Closing _line_Tight clothes and backpacks cause friction that leads to pimples. Naturally, if you're sweating up a storm, that's only going to contribute to the horror that is bacne. Do yourself a favor and opt for looser shirts and dresses on those particularly hot days. If you must put on that body-con dress, stick to natural, breathable materials like cotton or silk._line_Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Diggy Lloyd_line_"

S'The oil & gas sector remained a bright spot in an otherwise subdued quarter for the overall market, reporting 3% y-o-y PAT growth (ex-OMCs) versus 4% decline for NIFTY. Similarly, aggregate EBITDA (ex-OMCs) rose 8% y-o-y, 8% ahead compared to 1% fall for Nifty. OMCs too reported robust core earnings, aggregate core EBITDA up 59% y-o-y, but suffered from severe inventory losses, `70 billion overall. All sub-sectors performed ahead of estimates, notably: CGD companies beat volume, IGL, GGL reported double digit growth and margin estimates; ONGC reported strong operational performance led by robust gas output and cost efficiencies; and RIL\xe2\x80\x99s refining and petchem came 2% and 8% ahead despite subdued market dynamics._line_We forecast earnings momentum to sustain given that benchmark GRM is up 20% QTD. While core GRM for OMCs will rise further due to stabilisation of refinery expansions, healthy CGD volume growth is likely to sustain despite GST headwinds. In addition to benign gas cost, GAIL and ONGC in particular will benefit from robust domestic gas production. Top picks: RIL, IGL and IOCL. We believe, operationally, Q1FY18, ex-inventory and one offs, surpassed estimates. City gas benefited from benign feedstock costs and favourable exchange rate. Cost efficiencies drove 15% EBITDA beat for ONGC, despite 8% lower oil price.

From what I know, there are those who debate if such stories such as the world\xe2\x80\x99s creation, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s sin, and the Exodus really occurred as described. Is there any way to determine when the Torah is and is not meant to be taken literally? _line_The Aish Rabbi Replies:_line_It is a very good and important question. Before all, I should state that our tradition teaches us that every word of the Torah is the precise word of God, as dictated to Moses (Talmud Sanhedrin 99a, Maimonides Laws of Repentance 3:8). The Torah is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Torah of truth\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g. Malachi 2:6, Yigdal prayer). Thus, our question, correctly stated, is not if parts of our Torah should not be taken as factual or accurate. The Torah is entirely \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the precise words of the God of truth. The question is only if God intended His words to be understood as literal truth or at times more figuratively. _line_A second general point I should make is that generally speaking, this is not something we need to figure out on our own. When God gave Moses the Torah, He also gave him the Oral Law, explaining how the Written Torah was to be understood. (See here for more details on this.) The Oral Law tells us when laws and episodes of the Torah are to be understood literally and when more figuratively. _line_With these introductions, I think the general pattern we find in the Torah is that the vast majority of it is taken as literal truth. Certainly entire episodes such as the Flood and the Exodus occurred more or less as described. _line_Even so, there are many examples of specific events, details or laws which our tradition teaches us are not to be taken entirely literally. They are \xe2\x80\x9ctrue,\xe2\x80\x9d to be sure, but not true in a literal sense. _line_Perhaps the most salient example of this is the story of Creation. The Torah describes the creation as a simple process occurring in six days, yet clearly much more is involved than the simple reading of the Torah implies. The Talmud considers the story of creation to contain some of the deepest secrets of Kabbalah, which may be taught only to a single student at a time (Mishna Chagigah 2:1). _line_Further, the Sages clearly exclude the first days of Genesis \xe2\x80\x93 before Adam\xe2\x80\x99s creation \xe2\x80\x93 from our regular calendar. The current count of 5775 years from Creation actually counts from the first day of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s life (on Rosh Hashanah), not the first day of creation. The earlier days, before the world\xe2\x80\x99s first Rosh Hashanah, are described as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cyear of tohu (emptiness, chaos).\xe2\x80\x9d It is thus entirely possible that the \xe2\x80\x9cdays\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in the story of Creation do not mean 24-hour days but epochs. (See this article which discusses this at length.) _line_Another good example is Genesis 35:22 which states that Reuben slept with Rachel\'s handmaid Bilhah. The Talmud (Shabbat 55b) explains that he did not literally do so. Rather, he moved his father\'s bed from one tent to another (as a protest that after Rachel\'s death he moved in with Rachel\'s maid rather than with Leah). Even so, the Torah equated his action \xe2\x80\x93 taking liberties with his father\'s personal life \xe2\x80\x93 to actually committing the offense. _line_Below I cite some other well-known examples. _line_(a) The Torah appears to prescribe the punishment for certain offences as 40 lashes (Deut. 25::3), while the Talmud teaches us that the verses should be read in a way which implies 39 (Mishna Makkot 3:10). _line_(b) The Torah\xe2\x80\x99s justice demands \xe2\x80\x9can eye for an eye\xe2\x80\x9d (Exodus 21:24) while the Talmud teaches us that the punishment is actually monetary. The meaning of the verse is that such is true justice \xe2\x80\x93 what the aggressor truly deserves. Yet in practice, the courts may not administer such a punishment \xe2\x80\x93 in part because knocking out the assailant\xe2\x80\x99s eye may kill him, giving him more than he deserves. The Torah\xe2\x80\x99s statement is true, yet not implementable in practice. (See here for a more detailed discussion.) _line_(c) The Torah appears to require that we place the head Tefillin between our eyes (Deut. 6:8), while that phrase is interpreted by the Talmud to mean the front part of the head (Menachot 37b based on Deut. 14:1). _line_(d) Adam was told that on the day he eats of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge he would die, yet he lived another 930 years. According to the Midrash, he did die on that \xe2\x80\x9cday\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 for 1000 years is a day in God\xe2\x80\x99s eyes (based on Psalms 90:4). _line_(e) There are verses which clearly use terms poetically, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cfour corners of the earth\xe2\x80\x9d of Isaiah 11:12. _line_Thus, in general, we will not find entire episodes in the Torah explained away as allegory. Yet, there is some degree of leeway in the interpretation of particular verses. Almost invariably, the classic sources guide us as to when the Torah\xe2\x80\x99s intent is more and less literal. _line_For the past few months, my colleague at work has been listening to Christian pop music. Over time, I have grown to enjoy it very much and even sing along! My conscious is telling me this is not okay. Any advice would be appreciated. _line_The Aish Rabbi Replies:_line_In Judaism, music and song is considered one of the most powerful forces that exist to affect the hearts of human beings. The entirety of Torah is referred to as a song. When Moses was commanded to write the first Torah scroll, he was told "So now, write this song\xe2\x80\xa6" (Deut. 31:19). This literally is referring to Deuteronomy chapter 32 which is an actual song, but is further referring to the entirety of Torah. This is part of the reason why the Torah scroll is not read in the synagogue like a book, rather the reader chants the Torah like a song. Every word of the Torah is accompanied by a note to be sung. _line_This is for a number of reasons. Firstly, the entirety of Torah comprises a giant symphony. Every detail represents a type of musical instrument, each one necessary for the wholeness of the great concerto. _line_Another reason is that music goes straight to the heart. In Judaism the heart is the place where the physical and spiritual aspects of a human being fuse into one existence. The expression of that dual existence is in the power of speech, which was launched at the moment of the combination of soul to body. The zenith of speech is song, which draws upon the deepest connection of body and soul within the heart. _line_We learn this from the classical commentary of Rashi, explaining the profound, prophetic song sung by Moses and the Jews upon witnessing the splitting of the sea. "Then Moses and the Children of Israel sang this song\xe2\x80\xa6" (Exodus 15:1) "Then," says Rashi, means they harnessed a wellspring of emotion and thoughts from their hearts to sing this song. The theme of that song is the fusion of God\'s presence and providence to the mundane world, which is the cosmic mirror of the same fusion within the heart of man, the microcosm of the universe. The source for such a song is within the depths of the heart, and hence goes directly into the hearts of the listeners; heart to heart. _line_The Kabbalistic teachings are the most profound explanation of the deepest connection between the Shechina, Divine Presence, and the physical world, the "heart" of the universe. This is why Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna (18th century), one of the greatest Kabbalists of all time, proclaimed that only one who has the deepest understanding of music can truly understand the Kabbalah. _line_Maimonides explains that the prophets, to reach the level of connection necessary to reach prophecy, would play or listen to music. David played for King Saul to bring him to those levels, and later King David himself wrote an entire book of Psalms, prayers through music. The sages teach that Messsiah will teach us the "eighth tone," which will radically change music to become a Divine connection. _line_This explains why nations have national anthems, and armies march into battle amid musical accompaniments. Music has a profoundly influential as well as defining affect. Rock music, with its heavy emphasis on base notes, actually brings out the baser, more physical side of a person. _line_You should not underestimate the affect the Christian music can a will have upon your Jewish soul. I would not attribute this to "guilt," rather to a recognition your soul has that it is being watered by a source that doesn\'t jive with its essence, and will probably, if continued, have an effect you don\'t desire. _line_If God is truly omniscient and omnipotent (knows the future), then how do I have free will? Everything we do God must want us to do - since He is omnipotent. If I pursue one path, then this is the path that God wants me to pursue._line_Therefore how can man ever be punished? How can we be held responsible for our actions? And why bother changing?_line_I struggle with these philosophical issues constantly. Just for the record, I am a Jew exploring his Jewish roots, and am having seriously trouble reconciling many issues. Any information that you can provide would be greatly appreciated._line_By the way, does God determine who will win the Super Bowl?_line_The Aish Rabbi Replies:_line_Often, a result is predetermined, but the path to get there is not. I like to think of it as a circle, with one point designated as the "finish line." You can enter the circle at any point - but whichever way you go, you\'ll always end up at the finish line._line_For example, it may be predetermined that "Robert" will earn a million dollars this year. However, what is not predetermined is how Robert will get that money. For example, he could choose to work 60 hours every week, sacrificing his health and time with his family. Or he could spend all his time on the beach sipping iced teas, and buy a winning lottery ticket._line_But if Robert were to go out and receive his million dollars by robbing a bank, he can\'t say, "It\'s not my fault! It was predetermined!" This is because we are still responsible for all our actions, and are subject to a reward and punishment for every choice we make._line_Nevertheless, God not only knows every possible path, He also knows which path we will choose. And despite that, we still have free will._line_Confused? There was a book written nearly 100 years ago by a British mathematician, "Flatland," that may help explain this idea._line_Imagine a world which is only two-dimensional. That means everything is flat like a piece of paper. Everything that lives in this world is also flat. It might be a circle drawn on the paper - or a square or a triangle - but nothing in this flat world has any height whatsoever._line_What do with these beings see when they look at each other? When the Triangle looks across the flat edge of the paper at the Square, he only sees a line. As the Triangle moves around the Flatland, the line he sees may change in length and texture, but a line is all he is able to distinguish._line_Now let\'s imagine a human being comes along to visit this world, and sticks his finger through the piece of paper. What will those in Flatland see? They will see a flesh-colored line, bearing the texture of skin._line_Now imagine that the finger begins to move up and down, through the piece of paper. What will those in Flatland see? They will see a series of flesh-colored lines. Will they be able to imagine what the finger looks like? No. They may be able to gain some sense of three-dimensional characteristics of the finger, but they will not be able to construct a total picture of the finger - because they have no frame of reference for anything bearing three dimensions. Although the finger (and the human being who owns the finger) surely exists, those living in Flatland hit a mental block when trying to imagine or describe that which they have glimpsed._line_So too with us human beings in trying to imagine an infinite God, who exists in another dimension, outside the confines of time and space._line_We take the concept of "time" for granted, but time is also a creation. It was created in such a way that one thing would happen after the next. Imagine if time was never created. One minute you would be writing an email, the next minute you would be born, after that you would marry your spouse, and then go through puberty. Life would be very confusing. So God created time in order that we should be able to understand the events of our life._line_God, however, is above time. He can see the entire Master Plan, everything at once - birth, death, and everything in between. This is what the Sages expressed when they said, "Everything is foreseen, yet freedom is given to choose." (Talmud - Pirkei Avot 3:19)_line_Don\'t be dismayed if you don\'t understand how this is all possible. The fact that God knows the future yet we maintain free will at every moment is one of the great philosophical and theological mysteries of mankind. For so long as we live in the physical world, bound by the limits of time, we will not be able to understand this contradiction. The true answer of how this works, as Maimonides writes, is unknowable to the human mind. We simply do not possess the tools to imagine the infinite realm of God\'s existence._line_As for the Super Bowl, it seems that God has already determined who will win the game. Nevertheless, how it is played remains to be seen._line_(sources: Talmud - Sanhedrin 90b, Maimonides - Teshuva 5:5; Way of God 2:6:3)_line_'

S' NEW DELHI: A survey on ease of doing business conducted by NITI Aayog and the IDFC Institute, which was released on Monday, created a flutter as the results showed that it took companies 118 days to start a business and highlighted other difficulties faced by companies. _line_ The government issued a statement on Tuesday, saying the report itself states that it is meant to be a research document and its contents do not represent views of the government and NITI Aayog. _line_  The survey results varied from the findings of the World Bank\'s ease of doing business report, which has seen India gradually improve its rankings. The statement said the survey was conducted between April 2015 and April 2016 and does not reflect any changes in the ease of doing business since then. _line_ In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in easing various processes related to doing business. _line_ This has been verified by the World Bank. It is important to note that the enterprise responses are based on their past experiences and perceptions on doing business, dating as far back as 10 years or more. Reforms such as singlewindow clearance systems would not be applicable to many firms covered in the survey. _line_ "The survey indicates that the government\'s efforts to improve business environment are showing results on the ground. The experiences of startups, or enterprises started during or after 2014, suggest a significant improvement in doing business over time. Newer and younger firms take less time in obtaining approvals, highlighting a favourable business environment. Young firms report that most regulatory processes do not constitute a major obstacle to their doing business," the statement said. _line_ NITI Aayog sources said the survey results showed that in several areas the experience of companies is better than the World Bank survey. _line_Bookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. _line_'

S' Vijay Deverakonda_line_After wowing one and all with his act in Arjun Reddy, actor Vijay Deverakonda is going to take a complete U-turn for his next couple of films. The actor, whose distinct Hyderabadi Telugu accent, with a tinge of Telangana, has become his identity, is apparently going to take up the challenge of neutralising his accent for one of his upcoming films._line_While he is set to shoot for director Parasuram\xe2\x80\x99s next film soon, Vijay also has debutant director Bharat Kamma\xe2\x80\x99s film lined up, in which he will play a lad from Kakinada. \xe2\x80\x9cA part of the film will see Vijay as a college student, and will be shot in Kakinada. The film is an emotional love drama, which will show the protagonist\xe2\x80\x99s life journey over a few years. Since his character hails from the beach city, his accent will be neutral as opposed to the Telangana dialect synonymous with him,\xe2\x80\x9d shares a source, adding that Vijay\xe2\x80\x99s character will have a very intense edge to it._line_In fact, this film has come after a long wait for the director. \xe2\x80\x9cThe film was finalised even before Pelli Choopulu released.

S'Executive Summary_line_Many studies suggest that union members are less satisfied than nonunion workers but are also less inclined to quit their jobs. This surprising finding has been considered an anomaly by many researchers, as unions should achieve better working conditions, which common sense suggests should lead to higher job satisfaction. New research helps answer this puzzle. A recent meta-study finds that unions don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make workers less satisfied. Rather, workers who are likely to be dissatisfied \xe2\x80\x94 even after controlling for various aspects of their work \xe2\x80\x94 are more likely to join unions._line_Many employers are paying more and more attention to the well-being of their employees and to how they perceive their current jobs, especially because employee satisfaction is associated with important work-related outcomes such as organizational commitment and job performance, as well as with lower levels of turnover and absenteeism. But what role do unions, historically advocates for the well-being of workers, play in promoting employee happiness? The relationship between union membership and job satisfaction is still disputed vigorously among scholars. Many of the early studies suggest that union members are less satisfied than nonunion workers but are also less inclined to quit their jobs. This surprising finding has been considered an anomaly by many researchers, as unions should achieve better working conditions, which common sense suggests should lead to higher job satisfaction._line_My research helps answer this puzzle. In a recent meta-study, I found that unions don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make workers less satisfied. Rather, workers who are likely to be dissatisfied \xe2\x80\x94 even after controlling for various aspects of their work \xe2\x80\x94 are more likely to join unions._line_In his seminal 1978 work, Richard B. Freeman suggested that this apparent paradox could reflect the role of unions as a way for employees to voice critical attitudes toward the workplace. In order for the worker\xe2\x80\x99s voice to be heard effectively, the union\xe2\x80\x99s role included drawing workers\xe2\x80\x99 attention to what was wrong with their jobs. (Freeman also noted that this could benefit companies: By providing employees a voice, unions gave workers the option to complain about problems rather than leave their jobs.)_line_According to this way of thinking, the dissatisfaction of union members makes some strategic sense \xe2\x80\x94 dissatisfaction may actually increase the bargaining power of the union and motivate both sides to view workplace problems as more serious._line_Although this theory is interesting, an alternative view to the \xe2\x80\x9cvoice hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9csorting hypothesis.\xe2\x80\x9d For example, workers who experience poor working conditions are more likely to complain and to join a union. Similarly, workers can be more or less irritable and fussy and so are more or less inclined to join a union to express their dissatisfaction. Thus, the sorting hypothesis postulates that the characteristics of individuals who join a union or the features of the workplace are likely to influence the discontent of union members and the fact that individuals tend to unionize. In this view, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that being unionized makes employees less satisfied; it\xe2\x80\x99s that being the type of person who\xe2\x80\x99s often dissatisfied or working in a place where there\xe2\x80\x99s lots to be dissatisfied about makes you more likely to join a union._line_Which theory is right? Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s an empirical question._line_The purpose of my study was to provide a systematic and quantitative review of the existing empirical evidence on the effects of unionization on overall job satisfaction. I conducted a meta-analysis with results from a pool of 235 estimates from 59 studies published in academic journals from 1978 to 2015. Meta-analysis is particularly useful for identifying and quantifying patterns, for drawing inferences from a diversity of results, and for generalizing from results derived from numerous single studies. I employed a meta-regression analysis to quantify the effect of unionization on job satisfaction and to identify the main factors underlying the diversity in the results reported in existing empirical studies._line_Overall, I confirmed that unionization is negatively related to job satisfaction. Furthermore, the results suggest that the difference in job satisfaction between union members and nonunion members can be explained by a selection effect rather than a causal effect._line_The meta-analysis controlled for differences across individuals, jobs characteristics (such as monthly pay, monthly hours, and so on), and workplace characteristics (industry, workplace size, workforce composition, whether the establishment is publicly owned), and revealed that individual attributes have a more important effect than workplace attributes on the feeling that workers have toward their jobs._line_That is, some individuals seem to be characterized by higher aspirations toward their work environment, which leads them to join a union. Evidence also indicates that some other individual dispositions can influence job satisfaction. For example, ideological sympathy toward unions is an important factor that can lead an individual to join one, especially when there is freedom of choice about union membership, as is the case in some European countries._line_Unfortunately, many of the studies in this literature don\xe2\x80\x99t pay sufficient attention to these sorts of individual attributes. And the literature on this topic peaked in the early 2000s. As we academics like to say: More research is needed._line_My results dispute the idea that unions cause their employees to be dissatisfied; the dissatisfaction of union members is real, but it\xe2\x80\x99s due to the working conditions and the types of workers that tend to be unionized. That puts the onus for workplace satisfaction squarely on companies. The results suggest that dissatisfaction can\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed on the union, which means HR managers should address workers\xe2\x80\x99 expectations, in particular their need to express their discontent with certain elements of their jobs. It may be advisable to implement systems of employee representation and expression, especially when there is no union representative in the workplace. Workplace practices such as suggestion boxes or working groups aim to encourage employee participation and involvement in the attainment of workplace objectives. By providing information to management about employees\xe2\x80\x99 collective preferences, these workplace practices can enable HR departments to choose a better mix of working conditions, workplace rules, and employee remuneration. This can produce a more satisfied, cooperative, and productive workforce._line_'

S" Lucknow: Brainstorming among BJP leaders in Delhi and UP over the selection of a new UP chief has zeroed down to four names of the nine under consideration. _line_ Among them are two Union ministers in the Modi cabinet\xe2\x80\x94minister of state for HRD Mahendra Nath Pandey and minister of state for food processing Sanjeev Baliyan, minister for transport (independent charge) in Yogi cabinet Swatantra Deo Singh and general secretary in UP BJP Ashok Kataria, revealed highly placed sources. _line_ However, the names of the other four to five leaders have not been ruled out, sources said. _line_ The selection of UP BJP chief is being made keeping in mind Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Who ever is appointed at the post will shoulder the responsibility of retaining the number of seats that BJP got in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. _line_ There are higher chances that the BJP chief will be from west UP than from eastern UP, sources said. The reason is, they said, that most top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and existing UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya represent eastern UP. _line_ According to sources, if the BJP leadership selects Kataria, a Gujjar from west UP, there might not be much change in the cabinet with regard to west UP. _line_ However, if Baliyan is selected for the top organisation post in the state, chances are that the PM will include another Jat from west UP\xe2\x80\x94former Mumbai police commissioner and Baghpat MP Satya Pal Singh\xe2\x80\x94in his cabinet. _line_ In picking Swatantra Deo Singh, the BJP leadership would be appeasing OBCs as Singh is a Kurmi from Orai district. Besides, Singh is deft in handling organisation matters and has been on the forefront in organising PM Modi's rallies in the state. _line_ As the BJP has been focusing on wooing OBCs and Dalits as part of the party's strategy to regain power in the state, the fear of alienating Brahmins might make the party leadership pick Mahendra Nath Pandey. _line_ BJP is inclined towards announcing a new BJP chief before September 5. However, if it fails to draw consensus on any name, the new chief might be announced after September 20, skipping the duration of 'pitrapaksh' sources concluded. _line_"

S'With a new school year dawning, education officials are grappling with whether to remove the names, images and statues of Confederate figures from public schools \xe2\x80\x94 especially since some are now filled with students of color._line_ The violence at a white nationalist rally over a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, is giving school officials a new reason to reconsider whether it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for more than 100 schools to be named after Confederate generals and politicians from the Old South._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not make sense to have schools named after individuals who were directly connected to that dark past, and force kids in Dallas, a majority minority population, to walk into these schools every day and have to face this past every single day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miguel Solis, former board president and current board member of the Dallas Independent School District._line_ Dallas, along with other cities, began moving to change Confederate names and imagery after white nationalist and Confederate enthusiast Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17, 2015._line_ But the review gained momentum after the Aug. 12 protest by white supremacists in Charlottesville, which left one counter-protester dead._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate hate or discrimination of any form, and we are committed to providing an educational environment where all students can feel safe and welcomed at school,\xe2\x80\x9d said Superintendent Aurora Lora in Oklahoma City as she announced plans earlier this month to discuss name changes._line_ Her city has four schools named after Confederate generals, including an elementary school named after Native American Confederate Gen. Stand Watie, who led the Cherokee Regiment of Mounted Rifles. He was the only Native American to achieve the rank of general in the Civil War and was the last Confederate general to surrender, giving up on June 23, 1865._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to think about the people our buildings are named after and whether they represent the values we as a district have at this time,\xe2\x80\x9d Lora said._line_ According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there are at least 109 public schools named after Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis or other Confederate icons in the United States. Of those, \xe2\x80\x9c27 have student populations that are majority African-American, and 10 have African-American populations of over 90 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the SPLC\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 report._line_ Several school names were changed, or new schools were built and named after Confederates \xe2\x80\x9cduring the era of white resistance to equality,\xe2\x80\x9d the SPLC report said._line_ Solis said that the Confederate names in Dallas came about because of the local Ku Klux Klan._line_ He said his effort to change school names has had \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming support. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been people who have been very upset because they believe either the history needs to be preserved, or they align the philosophy of the Confederacy or neo-Nazis, but for the most part I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten support.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ This all comes as a wave of anti-Confederate imagery rolls across the country. Confederate statues are being taken down on college campuses and in cities around the nation, and others are being vandalized or covered._line_ For example, the University of Texas at Austin removed four Confederate statues and Duke University removed a damaged Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee statue earlier this month. In Charlottesville, workers draped giant black covers over the towering monument of Gen. Robert E. Lee on horseback and later a statue of Gen. Thomas \xe2\x80\x9cStonewall\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson._line_ The South has the majority of Confederate-named public schools in the country._line_ In Falls Church, Virginia, the school board has voted to rename J.E.B. Stuart High School. Stuart was a slaveholding Confederate general who was mortally wounded in an 1864 battle. In Montgomery, Alabama, the school board is looking at moving Lee\xe2\x80\x99s statue from the front of majority-black Robert E. Lee High School._line_ In Arlington, Virginia, Robert E. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s hometown, there is a move now to rename Washington-Lee High School. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to talk about the values these names reflect and the messages we are sending to our children,\xe2\x80\x9d Barbara Kanninen, Arlington school board chair, said in a statement._line_ At some schools, the push for change starts with the students. In Greenville, South Carolina, student Asha Marie started a Change.org petition to rename Wade Hampton High School. Hampton was a Confederate cavalry commander during the Civil War and was later elected governor of South Carolina and criticized the Reconstruction era which put black leaders in political office._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cRacism, bigotry, and a blatant lack of patriotism,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in her petition. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not values of South Carolinians and should not continue to be enshrined in a place of learning.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ But another student, Austin Ritter, started a counterpetition to keep the name. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to change the school\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d Ritter wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cChanging the name of this school will also change its history. It will change everything the school has stood for. Everything the school has done.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ At others, alumni and outsiders are the ones sounding the call._line_ The debate over the Stuart name change in Falls Church kicked off in earnest in 2015 when actress Julianne Moore, who attended Stuart in the \xe2\x80\x9970s, and Hollywood producer Bruce Cohen, a Stuart alumnus, launched a petition demanding the name change. In Alabama, it was a community activist who suggested moving the Lee statue out from in front of Robert E. Lee High School._line_ Changing a school\xe2\x80\x99s name is not cheap. In Oklahoma City, Lora said it could be $50,000 or more to change signage, letterhead, business cards and more for each school; Other school officials have quoted higher and lower figures._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cYou can make any excuse you want to try and stop something like this and dollars are what a lot of people lead with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solis, who called it a \xe2\x80\x9chollow argument.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ Instead, people should get creative, he said, for example, in Texas possibly renaming schools currently named after Robert E. Lee after golfer Lee Trevino, allowing them to keep the \xe2\x80\x9cLee\xe2\x80\x9d identity._line_ In Arlington, there has been some talk among some at Washington-Lee High School about possibly changing Robert E. Lee out of the school name to be replaced by his father, Revolutionary War Major-General Henry \xe2\x80\x9cLight-Horse Harry\xe2\x80\x9d Lee, who also was a Virginia governor and congressman, unofficial school historian John Peck said. Or perhaps rededicating the school to an ideal and de-emphasizing the namesakes, he said._line_ \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the names, but take the namesakes out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peck, who said the school\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team was the first integrated team to win Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s state basketball title in 1966. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Washington out, take Lee out. They don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mean all that much to the alumni who really, really cherish the school\xe2\x80\x99s legacy itself as built up by the students and the faculty over the years.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Credit : Associated Press (AP) | Photo Credit : (AP)_line_Like this:_line_'

S" As the festival season is approaching, update your wardrobe with fusion wear and look different. Invest in a boho jumpsuit, white sneakers, semi ethnic accessories , say experts._line_Shailja Mittal, Creative Head at Zapyle (an online marketplace for premium fashion) and Vidit Sehgal, Co-Founder at Lurap (an online platform which makes extra large clothing), have suggested few fusion looks that could be tried:_line_* From boho to ethnic: It's important to strike the right balance between the East and the West. Try a Boho jumpsuit with nicely coordinated ethnic accessories. Play up with your shoes for more detail. Throw on your white sneakers or a pair of silver metallic Kohlapuris._line_* Crop top and dhoti look: Pairing a designer Gujarati cold shouldered crop top with a plain bold coloured dhoti looks elegant and classy. Carry it with a stylish pair of jhumkas and matte lipstick which will absolutely complete your look._line_* Getting the right mix: Pick western wear basics, and weave them into a look that's absolutely ethnic inspired. Add semi-ethnic accessories for more drama._line_* The cool tones: Indian prints and fabric are more glamorous than they are perceived to be. An Indian indigo print top paired with white distressed jeans, metallic choker and sneakers would be a good example. _line_* Tradition with a twist: Talking about fusion/Indo-western, rev-up your cotton kurtas by giving it a fusion twist. Pair up an undyed cotton kurta with a flared Yellow midi skirt, throw on a pair of sneakers or high-tops, pull up a backpack. Finish the look with some chunky metallic bangles. _line_* Floral and mute colours: Instead of shimmery and glitters, wear muted colour prints either on a bold colour base or just some added embellishment on the floral. _line_Layered organza tops in print outer layer and sequin under layers is the stress free combination, whether you're wearing a high waist trouser, a full volume skirt or a typical lehenga or maybe even a sari._line_* Pathani suit and Kohlapuri: There are also various options available for men, you can stick to classic kurta pyajamas and pathani suits and team them with ethnic footwear or go experimental with modern times. _line_Dawn a hand block print kurta with readymade dhoti or stick to modern shirt kurtis and fusion fashion them with scarf, shoes and finish the look off with classic shades for the day festivities, that will look dapper._line_IANS_line_"

S' While ticket sales for this cycle\'s World Cup qualifiers have been slow, crowds outside El Tri\'s training sessions show there are still fans who care _line_Great tickets are still available for Mexico\'s World Cup qualifier against Panama, at least if the national team\'s social media is any indication._line_Nearly every message from the account is reminding fans that tickets are available two for one, a deal that has been offered for several days now but remains in effect as directors attempt to make sure Estadio Azteca is full for Friday\'s match._line_It\'s not the first signs of apathy we\'ve seen from Mexico fans who used to pack the Azteca to the gills. Games against Costa Rica, Honduras and even the United States have failed to see the boisterous, sell-out crowds that had been commonplace in Santa Ursula. Is it poor scheduling of games? Continued difficulties in non-sporting sectors of the country? Or simply fatigue from the number of games being played there? Either way, fans in the capital don\'t seem to be caring about El Tri like they used to._line_Of course, apathy may be better than the outright anger for Juan Carlos Osorio when he returned from the Gold Cup. The manager was welcomed back home with jeers from fans who apparently had made the trip to the airport specifically to hurl insults at him, including telling the Colombian to go back to his country._line_It\'s easy to forget about how much the national team means to people, though maybe you could argue the fact that someone would take the metro to the airport to camp out and wait for a coach to come through is a certain kind of passion. It\'s easy to get hyper-focused on how Osorio is lining up the team or whether or not you like him or his ideas. Sometimes that\'s a lot of fun, but sometimes that obscures the joy of seeing your countrymen go up against another country in a sporting contest that will boost or lower national pride._line_There are still, however, millions of Mexicans who still feel that pride in the national team - and it doesn\'t take long to find them. Mexico\'s training sessions in Cuernavaca\'s Estadio Centenario have been full of fans hoping to catch a glimpse of a star or get an autograph from their favorite players._line_Los jugadores de @miseleccionmx regalaron aut\xc3\xb3grafos a los aficionados https://t.co/qIFc60WPld pic.twitter.com/DRfBFGF4vz \xe2\x80\x94 MedioTiempo (@mediotiempo) August 30, 2017_line_  Mexico is a country in a difficult time, and while the ramifications of that extend to players, owners and fans (the  Department of Treasury\'s recent delegation of Rafa Marquez as an alleged front man for a cartel kingpin  is the most recent reminder but there are others), but the national team still can bring joy. It likely will boost spirits at least somewhat by qualifying for the World Cup in this pair of games. _line_The reception in Cuernavaca, just two hours away from the capital by bus, has again been phenomenal as Mexico heads to the "City of Eternal Spring" for the second time in the Osorio era to try and combat the effects of Mexico City\'s altitude. It only serves to strengthen the idea that Mexico should begin playing World Cup qualifiers outside the capital in the next cycle, not because of a FIFA ban for a chant that the federation is attempting to eradicate but because Mexicans all around the country should be able to see their team. Estadio Chivas and Monterrey\'s Estadio BBVA Bancomer, which went viral for its beauty last week, are potential World Cup sites should North America be awarded the tournament in 2026. Surely if they\'re good enough to host World Cup matches, they\'re good enough to host qualifiers. _line_ Article continues below _line_The national team has its critics, and enthusiasm has wavered in some places, but this is a team that still matters to millions of people, people who would be thrilled to buy tickets at a two-for-one rate were they able to do so. Whether it means sacrificing a few lucrative U.S. friendly games, moving qualification games or something more creative, the Mexican federation must remember those millions._line_'

S'Modak is an Indian sweet made of rice flour or corn flour with grated coconut and jaggery as stuffing. This is one of the well known sweets that is prepared especially during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival._line_Although, it is one of the delicious prasads that one yearns for, yet with the high level of health hazards especially if you are a diabetic patient, you always reconsider your decision before having modaks._line_However, with modern methods of making modak, it can have health benefits too. Read on below to find out what health benefits modaks can have._line_Instead of coconut and jaggery, you can make your modak stuffing with beet root, oats and fruit fillings. Further, you can steam them just like your momo and avoid fried modak. It is always a preferable option to using ghee instead of oil for frying._line_Modak Filled With Nuts:_line_ If you have modak filled with nuts and fruits, it will appease your desire and control your health. Nuts, as we know contain unsaturated fat, omega 3, rich in vitamin E which prevents the development of plaques in arteries and contains high fibre. With such high nutritious value opting for such a modak is a viable option._line_Fruits Stuffed Modak:_line_ Fruits are rich in vitamins, fibre, potassium and folic acid. Fruit stuffed modaks are healthy as they contain these valuable ingredients which equally help you to stay fit and active._line_Oats Stuffed Modak:_line_ Another method, you can also use oats as stuffing. A bowl of oats is a healthy breakfast option that one can have. Having such healthy ingredients automatically makes modak a healthy food. Oats are rich in antioxidants, controls cholesterol and contain beta-glucan fibre. So, if you are worried that you had a ghee fried modak and it can be alarming for your cholesterol rise and subsequently affect your heart, then you can relax, because oats automatically eliminate the risk of increasing your cholesterol level._line_Beetroot Stuffed Modak:_line_ Beetroot contains vitamin C that boosts your immune system, potassium that eases your muscle movements, manganese that strengthens your bones, keeps a check on your liver, kidney and pancreas. So with such high nutritious value, grated beetroot can be another option for your modak preparation this season._line_'

S' (CNN)For any car manufacturer, introducing a new model is a risky moment. _line_When it\'s your best-selling product -- and arguably the vehicle that saved the company -- then you really take a deep gulp._line_But despite the stakes, Bentley is quietly confident about its new, third-generation Continental GT, which has been unveiled online ahead of a public debut at September\'s Frankfurt motor show. _line_The "Conti" (as company insiders refer to it) is the best-selling Bentley of all time; more than 70,000 examples have been sold, which is a sizeable number when every unit can cost $150,000 or more._line_It is also a constant reminder to the old-guarders in Bentley\'s sprawling factory site in Crewe, England, that German ownership can work. _line_The first Deutsche Bentley_line_When the Continental was launched back in 2009, it was the first new Bentley introduced under the stewardship of the mighty Volkswagen Group. _line_Engineers, designers and customers were worried about how traditional English craft skills in leather and fine wood veneers could marry German-influenced engineering and production techniques._line_Bentley has come a long way since then; it\'s enjoying record sales, thanks in no small measure to the success of the Bentayga SUV. But now it\'s time for an all-new Continental to help maintain that momentum. _line_The underpinnings are unmistakably VW Group -- the chassis is heavily based on one developed by Porsche. And there\'s even a German in charge of design: Stefan Sielaff, a 30-year Volkswagen veteran who has also held positions at Audi and SEAT. _line_A tidier look_line_Under his guidance, Bentley\'s designers have crafted a clever evolution of the swoopy grand tourer lines that made the Continental such a hit first time round. _line_Some cues -- the four headlights at the front, the distinctive haunch over the rear wheels -- have been retained. Other elements -- most notably, the rear lighting arrangement -- have been tidied up._line_The overall stance looks lower and a little more dramatic, a reflection of Bentley\'s desire to make the Conti a sports car as well as a grand tourer. It\'s a trick of the eye, though: the car is about the same length as before, and while the wings stretch a little wider, the overall width to the mirrors is the same._line_It\'s the roofline (lower by just under a centimeter) that has the biggest effect -- that and the longer wheelbase that pushes the wheels towards each corner. _line_Horizontal, single-piece tail-lights complete the effect, replacing the old two-level items from the outgoing model._line_\'Playing with millimeters\'_line_"We\'ve been playing with millimeters," Sielaff acknowledges. _line_"This is a successful model so you don\'t want to reinvent it completely. But we\'re pleased with the end result. It\'s still a classic Bentley tourer, but it\'s more than that."_line_The bonnet is now a beautifully crafted single piece of aluminum that helps to do away with the previous car\'s shut line, just at the front end of the hood. It\'s a neater effect but is the sort of machining that gives the production department nightmares. _line_"We had some interesting discussions," admits Sielaff, before pointing out the huge side panels that stretch from the top edge of the windscreen, all the way to the rear lights. They\'re extraordinarily complex, formed of metal but including half a dozen creases -- some of which run across into the doors. _line_"They\'re even more of a challenge, I\'m told," Sielaff says with the wry smile of a man who\'s had the internal arguments, and won them._line_100 million lines of code_line_Under its skin, the new Continental is a bit of a technological marvel. _line_The car is being launched with its flagship twin-turbocharged W12 petrol engine, which is more powerful than before and also 16 percent more fuel efficient. On board, there are 93 processors, feeding more than a 100 million lines of code through eight kilometers of wiring._line_There\'s likely to be a plug-in hybrid version during the car\'s life, too -- as soon as Bentley works out how to best \'synthesize\' the engine note to maintain emotional appeal when an electric motor is doing the work._line_It\'s inside where Bentley\'s quality and craftsmanship comes to the fore. You can now have two tons of veneer in the wraparound fascia, and 15 shades of hide (every Continental contains 310,675 stitches, in case you were wondering). _line_Or the influence of high-end watch manufacturing in the optional Cotes de Geneve turned-metal finish. And the three-sided screen that revolves, like the number plate on James Bond\'s Aston Martin DB5, to either show a flush piece of veneer, a Retina-resolution infotainment screen or a set of beautiful analogue dials._line_Even so, Darren Day, the firm\'s head of interior design, admits that if the Continental really is to bring in fresh customers to the brand, they have more work to do. _line_"We do get customers asking for vegan-compatible cabins," he says, "so we are researching into materials that can replace leather but still give us that luxurious feel."_line_It\'s more proof, if it were needed, that this famous old British brand is adapting to customer trends._line_And a reflection of the fact, surely, that to not do this would be the biggest risk of all._line_'

S' (CNN)Many of us equate "sex" with "intercourse" and use those words interchangeably. Yet highly satisfying sex doesn\'t have to be limited to penetration -- and doesn\'t even have to include it at all. _line_According to a recent study, many women report that they require clitoral stimulation to have an orgasm. _line_For the study, Debby Herbenick, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University and a research fellow and sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, and her colleagues assessed data from 1,055 women ages 18 to 94 who answered a detailed online survey about their sex lives. "Our purpose was to understand more about women\'s experiences with ... the kinds of touch they find pleasurable and how clitoral and vaginal stimulation contribute to their orgasms," she explained._line_In reading her results, I\'m struck by the idea that the majority of women report that they often don\'t reach orgasm through intercourse alone. This flies in the face of the stereotype of intercourse as the be-all and end-all of sexual activity -- and suggests that couples should explore the whole range of pleasurable options for achieving climax. The study contained a few compelling findings worth enumerating._line_Intercourse isn\'t everything_line_This study found that only about 18% of women reported being able to climax during intercourse from vaginal penetration alone. About 36% said they needed clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm during intercourse, and another 36% said it enhanced the experience. Yet, many women still fake orgasm during intercourse, according to therapist Laurie Mintz, author of the new book "Becoming Cliterate." _line_"The main reasons they give for faking is that they want to appear \'normal\' and want to make their male partners feel good," she said._line_"This is one of the saddest and most common problems I deal with in my clinical practice," added Anita Hoffer, a sexuality counselor and educator. "Women who either are uninformed or insecure and therefore easily intimidated by ignorant partners bear a great deal of shame and guilt at being unable to climax from intercourse alone. Many are greatly relieved when they learn that they are among the majority of women who engage in sexual intercourse."_line_Orgasms vary_line_Do some orgasms feel better than others? According to 78% of the survey respondents, the answer is yes. These so-called better orgasms aren\'t necessarily dependent on the length of an encounter. In fact, fewer than one in five women surveyed believed that longer sex contributed to better orgasms. _line_Instead, the most common contributors to orgasmic bliss included spending time to build arousal, having a partner who knows that they like, emotional intimacy and clitoral stimulation during intercourse, said Herbenick. "A woman\'s general mood and stress level -- including the degree to which she is able to mindfully immerse in the sexual encounter -- can have an impact on orgasm quality too," Mintz explained._line_\'Outercourse\' matters_line_This term "outercourse" refers to sex that isn\'t intercourse and doesn\'t involve penetration. It can include kissing, touching, erotic massage and using sex toys, just to name a few options. _line_"When we equate intercourse and sex and call everything that comes before intercourse \'foreplay,\' we are buying into the cultural script that sex should proceed as follows: foreplay (just enough to get her ready for intercourse), intercourse (during which both women and men orgasm), and game over," Mintz said. But sex doesn\'t have to involve intercourse at all. Even when it does, other forms of stimulation can add to the experience and may improve the odds of reaching orgasm. _line_Herbenick suggested that couples take a lesson from the early days of their relationship. "Sometimes, when people are first getting together, they spend time making out and touching each other\'s genitals long before they start having oral sex or intercourse with each other," she explained. "All too often, once oral sex and intercourse become part of their routine, the rest fades away -- which is too bad, considering how powerful genital touching can be."_line_Communication is key_line_The study found that 41% of women prefer just one style of touch. "This underscores how important it is to have conversations about sex and pleasure or even to show your partner what you like, since otherwise, the chances of just stumbling upon that one preference are pretty low," Herbenick said. "Couples should be having conversations about what they like, what they don\'t like, what feels good and leads to orgasm, as well as what feels good but doesn\'t necessarily lead to orgasm." _line_Join the conversation_line_See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter._line_One good source of information about women\'s sexual pleasure that can help you get the conversation started is the website for OMGYES, which sponsored the study. The site, which states it\'s for 18-year-olds and older, contains a series of videos that demonstrate different types of touch that real women find pleasurable, including techniques labeled "edging," "layering" and "orbiting." There is a free preview but a cost to access all of them._line_I\'ve found this site very helpful to my female patients and their partners who want to learn more about female pleasure. "It tastefully and unselfconsciously names, describes and normalizes behaviors that are universal and, by example, invites the viewer to experiment and learn," Hoffer said. "As Leonore Tiefer (sex researcher, therapist and activist) has said, \'Sex is not a natural act,\' and good lovemaking is an art that must be learned and practiced." _line_'

S'ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria has approved the construction of a $5.8 billion hydroelectric power plant by a Chinese state firm, the power minister said on Wednesday, the latest in a series of Chinese deals since the project was first envisioned decades ago. _line_The project, if completed, could provide a much needed source of energy for Nigeria. Despite its wealth of crude oil, Africa\'s largest economy has long struggled with rickety power infrastructure, leaving many homes and businesses dependent on costly and inefficient fuel-powered generators. _line_The 3,050 megawatt (MW) Mambilla hydroelectric plant has been planned for over three decades. Various administrations have pledged to begin work, signing contracts and memoranda of understanding but next to nothing has been done. _line_Nigeria\'s cabinet signed off on the award of the contract to build Mambilla to the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), Babatunde Fashola, the minister of power, works and housing, told reporters in Abuja. _line_China\'s Export-Import Bank will provide 85 percent of the funding and Nigeria\'s government will supply the remaining 15 percent for the joint venture, Fashola said, adding that construction should take around six years. _line_"The scope of works is very extensive, it requires the construction of four dams," he said. _line_"It will involve a lot of preparatory work (and) resettlement ... It will also help Nigeria strike a very big blow on the climate change issue." _line_But environmental groups raised concerns about the project. _line_"Many fear that Mambilla will go the way of previous large development projects (including large hydropower projects) where contracts are meted out but projects are never built," International Rivers campaign group wrote on its official site. _line_"If the Mambilla dam project does continue, it could mean disastrous environmental and social impacts for those already living in poverty along the banks of the Benue River," it said. _line_Reporting by Felix Onuah; Writing by Paul Carsten, editing by David Evans_line_Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles._line_'

S'Summary_line_North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan and into the pacific ocean._line_Stocks tumbled in pre-market trading, but bounced back intra-day._line_Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile unprecedented and a serious threat to Japan._line_Financial markets could remain volatile if the North Korea situation is not resolved amicably._line_Source: CNBC_line_Monday night North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean:_line_North Korea has fired a ballistic missile that passed over Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters early Tuesday._line_A South Korean military official told NBC News that the missile was fired around 5:57 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The official said that the missile flew for about 2,700 kilometers (1,678 miles), reaching a maximum altitude of 550 kilometers (342 miles). U.S. Pacific Command projected that the missile splashed down at 6:29 a.m. local time._line_Later Tuesday, Abe said the missile was an unprecedented, serious and grave threat to Japan. The Japanese prime minister said he would ask the United Nations to up the pressure on Pyongyang._line_Tensions have been heightened between North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. since February when North Korea launched an intermediate range ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. Experts assumed the missile test was designed to test the preparedness of the new Trump administration. Nonetheless, having launched a missile shortly after the election was bound to get President Trump\'s attention._line_The Trump administration responded by positioning military assets in South Korea. The U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system ("Thaad"), designed to protect South Korea against attacks from short and medium-range ballistic missiles. Thaad\'s infrared seeker technology is designed to detect incoming threats and strike the target with a missile of its own. The problem is that Thaad\'s presence might have further heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean populace has looked askance at the United States\' beefed up military presence there. China doesn\'t want Thaad because it could potentially help the U.S. track Chinese missiles aimed at the U.S. Lastly, North Korea sees more U.S. military assets on its border as a threat._line_Impact On Financial Markets_line_In pre-market trading the Dow Jones (DIA) was down by triple digits. Financial markets do not like risk, and it is difficult to quantify the unknown. North Korea\'s previous missile launches were sent into the Sea of Japan; to send a missile over Japan is dangerous and unprecedented. War games would likely be good for defense stocks, but I cannot see how broader markets would benefit. The U.S. financial markets have been buoyed by record low interest rates and trillions in economic stimulus, and the bull market appears long in the tooth. Markets are on edge that the Fed will eventually take away the punch bowl by hiking rates or unwinding its holdings of government treasuries and mortgage-backed securities._line_The last thing markets need is uncertainty over North Korea. How would a conflict impact Trump\'s plan to cut corporate taxes? Would it potentially derail the president\'s planned infrastructure spending? These concerns alone could be enough to send stocks into a tailspin._line_Is Diplomacy Still Possible?_line_The U.S. and China have tried issuing economic sanctions against North Korea. In February China banned coal imports from North Korea after Kim Jong-Un successfully fired a ballistic missile. The lion\'s share of North Korean coal is shipped to China. Still, North Korea has persisted in its provocations. Monday\'s missile traveled 1,678 miles. To hit the American island of Guam a North Korean missile would only have to fly about 2,100 miles. Monday\'s action seems to be a message from Kim Jong-Un that he could attack U.S. soil if he wanted._line_The Trump administration would like to cut North Korea off before it develops the capability to hit the continental U.S. On the flip side Kim Jong-un wants to run his country without interference. He believes that only a nuclear threat to the U.S. could defend him against regime change that befell Moammar Gaddafi in Libya and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Global markets hang in the balance if the two sides cannot find a happy medium._line_Conclusion_line_Kim Jong-un wants assurances that the U.S. will not attempt to remove him from office. The U.S. and the rest of the world want North Korea to stop trying to extend its nuclear capabilities. I do not envision either side coming to an agreement anytime so, which portends more volatility ahead for financial markets._line_Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours._line_I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Because of the mass tourism, beaches in Barcelona city are terribly dirty and always super crowded. Waikiki or Roca Plana are for sure less invaded, so you can really enjoy a sunbath and relax. The water is blue, the golden sand is thin and it is a quiet place within a natural environment.

S' Launched 20 years ago, NASA\'s Cassini spacecraft now has less than 20 days for its mission-ending dive into the atmosphere of Saturn._line_ Its fateful plunge on September 15 is a foregone conclusion -- an April 22 a gravitational kick from Saturn\'s moon Titan placed the two-and-a-half ton vehicle on its path for impending destruction, NASA said. _line_ "The Cassini mission has been packed full of scientific firsts, and our unique planetary revelations will continue to the very end of the mission as Cassini becomes Saturn\'s first planetary probe, sampling Saturn\'s atmosphere up until the last second," said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist from NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. _line_ "We\'ll be sending data in near real time as we rush headlong into the atmosphere -- it\'s truly a first-of-its-kind event at Saturn," Spilker said._line_ Cassini\'s imaging camera will be off during this final descent, having taken a last look at the Saturn system the previous day, September 14. _line_ The spacecraft is expected to lose radio contact with Earth within about one to two minutes after beginning its descent into Saturn\'s upper atmosphere. _line_ But on the way down, before contact is lost, eight of Cassini\'s 12 science instruments will be operating. _line_ In particular, the spacecraft\'s ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS), which will be directly sampling the atmosphere\'s composition, potentially returning insights into the giant planet\'s formation and evolution. _line_ On the day before the plunge, other Cassini instruments will make detailed, high-resolution observations of Saturn\'s auroras, temperature and the vortices at the planet\'s poles. _line_ "The end of Cassini\'s mission will be a poignant moment, but a fitting and very necessary completion of an astonishing journey," said Earl Maize, Cassini Project Manager at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. _line_ The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. Launched in 1997, Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004._line_ As Cassini completes its 13-year tour of Saturn, its Grand Finale -- which began in April -- and final plunge are just the last beat. _line_ Following a four-year primary mission and a two-year extension, NASA approved an ambitious plan to extend Cassini\'s service by an additional seven years. _line_ Called the Cassini Solstice Mission, the extension saw Cassini perform dozens more flybys of Saturn\'s moons as the spacecraft observed seasonal changes in the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. _line_ From the outset, the planned endgame for the Solstice Mission was to expend all of Cassini\'s maneuvering propellant exploring, then eventually arriving in the ultra-close Grand Finale orbits, ending with safe disposal of the spacecraft in Saturn\'s atmosphere._line_ "The Grand Finale represents the culmination of a seven-year plan to use the spacecraft\'s remaining resources in the most scientifically productive way possible. By safely disposing off the spacecraft in Saturn\'s atmosphere, we avoid any possibility Cassini could impact one of Saturn\'s moons somewhere down the road, keeping them pristine for future exploration," Maize added. _line_ --IANS gb/bg_line_( 491 Words)_line_'

S'As Hurricane Harvey continues to substantially impact the state of Texas with torrential rains and flooding, the storm\'s devastation has unfortunately also served as a reminder that, earlier this month, President Donald Trump rolled back flood regulations designed to help infrastructure survive catastrophic weather events. While this news was announced in mid-August, it is particularly jarring to reflect upon in the wake of Harvey\'s destruction._line_The Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, the flood regulations which Trump rolled back, were established by the Obama administration in 2015. These regulations dictated that infrastructure projects, like bridges and roads, had to be designed to withstand sea level rises and other ramifications of climate change. While these standards had not yet been implemented, as FEMA had been soliciting implementation input, Trump decided this month that he believed the regulations were unwieldy and would cause infrastructure construction delays._line_In his press conference earlier this month announcing the rollback of these regulations, Trump noted that the impetus behind his decision to rescind these protections stemmed from a desire to "slash the time it takes" to approve new infrastructure projects. Trump also stated that, "We\'re going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively, relatively speaking, and the permitting process will go very, very quickly."_line_When Trump announced his decision to roll back these flood regulations, he was extensively criticized by emergency management specialists as well as by environmental activists. Indeed, the former director of public affairs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Rafael Lemaitre, told Reuters that Trump was undoing "the most significant action taken in a generation" to protect infrastructure._line_Eliminating this requirement is self-defeating; we can either build smarter now, or put taxpayers on the hook to pay exponentially more when it floods. And it will._line_#Trump undid @BarackObama flood protection #regulations just before #HurricaineHarvey. His obsession to undo Obama legacy will cost lives. https://t.co/Nt9srFUXwp_line_\xe2\x80\x94 John Hansen (@johnhanseneco) August 28, 2017 _line_Moreover, an environmental advocate and an insurance industry advocate also wrote a joint op-ed in POLITICO condemning the president\'s decision and warning of the risks posed by floods, both after catastrophic weather events and in day-to-day life._line_While many Americans may think flooding is only a problem for coastal regions prone to hurricanes and tropical storms, it is far more widespread than that and can devastate any state or region across the country. In just the past five years, all 50 states have experienced flood damage._line_On the flip side, those who praised Trump\'s decision to roll back flood regulations consisted of several business groups, including the National Association of Home Builders, which had expressed concern about rising construction costs._line_On Twitter, many users appeared aghast and infuriated that Trump had undone these regulations just weeks prior to Hurricane Harvey. Multiple Twitter users accused the president of rescinding these regulations as a means of attempting to dismantle former president Obama\'s legacy \xe2\x80\x94 and disregarding the consequences in the process._line_Time will tell if, in light of Harvey, Trump will reconsider his roll back of these regulations or proceed with rescinding them as planned. However, one can be sure that, if Trump does refuse to reinstate these regulations, many members of the public will probably not look very favorably on his decision, to say the least._line_'

S'The next episode of Game of Thrones might not come until \xe2\x80\x94 deep breath, now \xe2\x80\x94 2019, but at least there will always be YouTube. The latest GOT makeup tutorial we\'re loving pays homage to Daenerys Targaryen\'s subtle, natural look. It comes from Jessica Vill (aka Jbunzie) who has convincingly transformed into everyone from Selena Gomez to Ariana Grande. This time around, she could seriously pass for Emilia Clarke\'s twin._line_Jessica used just a few makeup products very strategically, including the Urban Decay Naked Basics Palette ($29) to copy Khaleesi\'s brow and eye structures. Then, she used Besame Cosmetics Chocolate Kiss Lipstick ($22) both on her cheeks and lips, smudging out the edges to get that perfect blotted, just-kissed look. One brilliant tip she divulged was to stuff cotton into your upper lip for a "temporary lip job" that emulates Emilia\'s own natural fullness._line_Now, all your missing for your Halloween costume is a wig, dress, and your very own Jon Snow.

S'MedLife, a Bengaluru-based online pharmacy, is planning to invest $30 million over the next one year to scale up its business. The self-funded company will raise money from the founders\xe2\x80\x99 capacities as shareholders, as well as from their family trust, as reported by VCCircle._line_The company plans an aggressive expansion across India with the new injection of cash and plans to expand its operations across 100 cities, including tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Currently, MedLife operates in 34 cities, out which it serves 19 directly. The rest are run through partnerships. The founders also hope to expand the business from delivery of drugs to related spheres like diagnostics and e-consultation. They also plan to set up their own laboratories from the next year._line_MedLife said it receives 10,000 prescriptions while completing 4,000 deliveries a day. It is well on its way to complete a gross revenue of Rs 300 crore for the financial year of 2017-2018._line_Regulations _line_Note that online pharmacies are still not regulated entities in India. Last March, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in March proposed an electronic/online platform for regulating the sale of medicines in India, and had initiated a public consultation. This came after offline pharmacy owners and retailers had called for a nationwide bandh to protest the regularizing sale of medicines through Internet in November last year. They had alleged that online pharmacies are doing business illegally and are in contravention of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940._line_However, many online pharmacies operate under as marketplaces and intermediary liability will apply to these companies. Intermediary liability means that the marketplace isn\xe2\x80\x99t held accountable for what is sold on it, because they\xe2\x80\x99re just a marketplace, not the vendor. This is called a safe harbour. If the intermediary knows what is being sold, they\xe2\x80\x99re liable._line_\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the medicines are concerned, the pharmacist in the store dispenses them according to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and they are the final decision maker. Of course we would be liable if we are showing wrong information or misleading consumers,\xe2\x80\x9d 1mg Founder Prashant Tandon explained to MediaNama._line_Competition_line_MedLife\xe2\x80\x99s biggest competition is from 1MG, which raised $15 million in series C funding from HBM Healthcare, apart from existing investors Sequoia Capital and Maverick and Kae Capital contributing as well._line_Another competitor is PharmEasy, which received $17 million in a series B funding from various investors- Bessemer VenturePartners, Orios Venture Partners, and Aarin Capital, to name a few._line_Myra, another Bengaluru-based epharmacy company, raised $7 million from Matrix Partners and Times Internet to expand their growth._line_'

S'A techie had a horrendous experience on his way back home when he hailed a random cab and ended up being robbed and \'thrown\' away far from home. On Monday night, a group of men who posed as a driver and passengers picked up the 35-year-old techie and robbed and assaulted him, before throwing him away near Jaraganahalli and speeding by. _line_Although, the techie tried to fight back initially, he had to eventually give in to their demands and hand over his valuables. Raghunanadan Raju, who is a resident of Vajarahalli got late while completing an office errand and missed the last metro. At around 11:10 pm, he decided to go to Yelachenahalli and find a way to get back home. Speaking to the mirror, he said, "I tried booking a cab online but none was available. But, there were many vehicles, including cabs, passing by, calling out names of places they were heading for. One of them, a Tata Bolt, stopped near the Metro and the driver said he was heading for Raghuvanahalli.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Raju realised that the \'passengers\' were behaving strangely when they reached Konanukunte. They were very inquisitive about his background and personal details. When Raju asked them to mind their own business and asked the driver to stop the car, they locked the car instead and kept on going. Raju further said, "I started screaming for help. They drove to Doddakallasandra, Chunchagatta and back towards Yelachenahalli. I tried to fight them, but they took out a sword and threatened me."_line_When the vehicle was about to reach a police checkpost, the driver took a U-turn. They then stopped the car at a truck terminus in Jaraganahalli and demanded he handed over the valuables. Raju said, "I gave them a gold chain, bracelet, two rings and cash. They returned my wallet after taking the cash. Then they started driving again, and I shouted at them to let me go as I had given them all I had. They dropped me at on the service road near Delhi Public School."_line_The gang asked him to run in the opposite direction so that he did not take note of the registration number as the car sped away. Raju eventually took the help of a passerby to book a cab back to Yelachenahalli Metro station. He reached out to the police and sought the CCTV footage of the cab, which is when he was directed to the KS Layout police station as the incident happened in their jurisdiction. Raju said that the men were between 30 and 35 years and they spoke in Kannada and Telugu. Meanwhile, the cops said, "Two CCTV cameras on the spot had captured the car, but the number was not clear."_line_'

S'10_line_"I don\'t consider myself a typical fitness person. I was born in Massachussetts but grew up in New York, and my exercise involved dancing on tables until 4 o\'clock in the morning. [Laughs] But then I was seeing this guy, a musician, who hurt his back really badly on tour. I was like, \'Maybe you should try Pilates?\' I had done it before but I didn\'t plan on going back. But he went to a class and dragged me with him, and I kind of fell in love with it. I saw a change in my body\xe2\x80\x94I looked in the mirror and my collarbones were open. I could feel every single muscle come to life. That was awesome. And I kept going. I became addicted in the best way._line_It just felt like time for a change. I found a studio I could walk to and studied for a year\xe2\x80\x94training, anatomy, plus every add-on course you could take. I was doing anatomy coloring books and learning every muscle name. It was so mentally stimulating, and my body had never been stronger. After the course I said, \'I\'m going to open my own studio,\' and they said, \'Nobody does that right after.\' And I did\xe2\x80\x94two weeks later. At first it was all of my friends, but it quickly outgrew that. Now we\'re in the Tribeca studio, and it\'s a dream come true._line_BODY_line_ Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s like, \'Pilates is so easy!\' But there\'s nothing easy about what we do. For me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mind and body experience. I know people are saying that a lot nowadays, but when you feel strong, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost floating\xe2\x80\x94for me, it frees up a lot of mind space. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a moving meditation. And it\'s also a pretty intense workout. It wakes up your neurotransmitters, and you elongate your spine, which leaves a lot of room for the discs in between. If you have scoliosis like I do, your discs have more room, and then all those nerves can fire better. It\'s magic for me._line_So hell yeah, I do Pilates every day. I do a self-workout in the morning and at night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anything, I could do it in bed. I just have a little space, and I use a mat and a couple props and weights. Then when I go to my studio, I have all that glorious space and all the machines. I\xe2\x80\x99m working right now and honing in my own personal mat practice, and my clients are really loving it. It feels good._line_Dry brushing is another thing I do daily\xe2\x80\x94I\'m in love with my dry brush, which is Japanese, and I got it from Tortoise General Store in Venice Beach. You always brush towards the heart, right before you get into the shower, and you slough off all of the junk. It\'s incredible for ingrown hairs, and it\'s good for the lymph. I also make my own body scrub out of salt and sugar and whatever oils I have on hand, but if I don\'t have anything, I\'ll just do the dry brush. After that I\'ll use this Strange Invisible Perfumes Body Wash, which smells like neroli, and I pat the Kahina Body Serum on all over. That has a some neroli in it, too. _line_HEALTH_line_ My favorite thing right now is this CBD oil. It\xe2\x80\x99s cannabis-derived, but you can buy it in California at the health food stores without having to go to a dispensary. It calms my nerves so much, but I mix it with my beauty oil and it\xe2\x80\x99s really really good for the skin, too. My friend gave me this L-Phenylalanine\xe2\x80\x94she says it\xe2\x80\x99s like herbal Xanax, and it helps me sleep. I always hand them out to people. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice because it can completely help you sleep, but without that hangover feeling that sometimes comes with melatonin._line_I also do B12 injections at home\xe2\x80\x94I get them from my doctor. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in just \xe2\x80\x98taking taking taking\xe2\x80\x99 supplements. I think our bodies change all the time, so I tend to just take vitamins when I need them. Especially when I\'m in New York, I make sure to take liquid vitamin D\xe2\x80\x94I think we\'re all a little vitamin D deficient. You could be in the sun all day, but it doesn\'t mean your body\'s absorbing it perfectly. It keeps me feeling well. _line_My diet is pretty healthy, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not obsessive about it. I eat vegan and I just happen to love it. When I grew up, my parents were definitely not vegan by any stretch\xe2\x80\x94although, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting them into it. I just grew up in rural Massachussetts where no one was doing it, and I was this health food store nerd. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I get my beauty products._line_SKINCARE_line_ I do a facial steam with a Conair steamer, and I put something really weird in\xe2\x80\x94it\'s called Swiss Kriss, and it\'s an herbal laxative. I learned about it from my rock \'n\' roll days, from somebody who partied their face off and should have honest to God looked 20 years older than they were. I was like, \'What do you do?\' And she was like, \'Swiss Kriss, baby.\' It smells really nice, and it wakes you up and tightens the skin. I\'ve been doing it for so long and I barely know why. It\'s my favorite. _line_Then I have these Ursa Major face wipes I use in between steams. I\'m very particular about wipes, but these don\'t have a strong scent, and they don\'t leave a film. I always have a couple of those in my bag. I also love this Dr. Alkaitis Organic Purifying Facial Cleanser. All of his products are really good, but this is the best. It resets my skin. If I\'m working out, I put on this Grown Alchemist Hydra Mist with Desert Lime. I mostly use oils instead of creams\xe2\x80\x94I like this argan oil from Kahina Giving Beauty, which is an amazing company. When I do use creams, I like something heavy. May Lindstrom\'s Blue Cocoon fixes everything. I also like Egyptian Magic, which is so cute. That\'s more for my body when I need to hydrate all over._line_But this May Lindstrom Problem Solver Mask is the star of the show. It transforms. When you mix it it\'s all frothy, and I love painting it on. I make everybody do it when they come over. And it doesn\'t dry out your skin, or make it so you can\'t talk\xe2\x80\x94you wake up the next morning with perfect skin. It pulls everything out. If I have a little blemish, I use this Pratima Sandalwood Soothing Lotion. It\'s incredible for spots, and it\'s pretty. The Sandalwood Rose Mask is awesome, too. It calms, it\'s woody\xe2\x80\x94I\'m a Virgo and it\'s very grounding. [Laughs]_line_MAKEUP_line_ This Givenchy Mister Eyebrow is probably my favorite thing in the world. It\'s such a silly name, but whatever. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten all my boyfriends into it\xe2\x80\x94everybody will use it. If I could only have one makeup product, it would be this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice taupe-blond, and it really seals, so I can go swimming in it, or I can work out, and it stays. Genius. My mascara is Diorshow Waterproof Blackout because I always work out, and it\'s awesome for Pilates. It doesn\'t move or irritate my eyes, and it comes off pretty easily, too. _line_My YSL Touche \xc3\x89clat is shade 2. I just do it under my eyes and around my nose. That\'s for shoots or events\xe2\x80\x94it\'s less natural looking, so I won\'t wear it to work out. I use something like RMS Un Cover-Up instead. I\'ve been loving Kjaer Weis lately, especially the bronzer. It screws in and out and there\'s a mirror in the compact. My skin loves it, and that\'s good for working out, too, because it\'s a creamy formula. I used to use powders and my friends, who are so sweet, would just be like, \'Do you want to blend that?\' [Laughs] With this, you just kind of pinch your cheeks and go. _line_HAIR_line_ Olaplex was just recommended to me. I do it once a week to restore [the color] and make sure it stays healthy. I also love Revive Conditioner Under Luna, which smells like a banana smoothie. I mix in a little bit of the Oribe Bright Blond, leave it in for 20 minutes, put a Muji hair towel over it, and then wash it off. That keeps the color fresh. _line_I go to Danielle Viscuso at Marie Robinson for my blond. She\'s amazing-mazing-mazing. I\'m so fussy\xe2\x80\x94we\'ve gone through champagne blond, buttery blond, and dream blond, and she keeps it alive. Which is incredible, because obviously, I\'m not this blond in real life. [Laughs] Jess Gillin also at Marie Robinson is the best cut. Her cuts grow out so beautifully. I could get a trim from her, and six months later, even with my dead ends, it still has a gorgeous shape. It took a long time to find them, but these are my people. I\'m pretty consistent with how I wear it, too. I want to play with it, I want it blowing around, it\'s a fun accessory. Almost like a crown."_line_\xe2\x80\x94as told to ITG_line_Karen Lord photographed by Tom Newton at her home in New York on April 6, 2017._line_'

S' Understanding the origin of life is arguably one of the most compelling quests for humanity. This quest has inevitably moved beyond the puzzle of life on Earth to whether there\'s life elsewhere in the universe. Is life on Earth a fluke? Or is life as natural as the universal laws of physics?_line_ Jeremy England, a biophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is trying to answer these profound questions. In 2013, he formulated a hypothesis that physics may spontaneously trigger chemicals to organize themselves in ways that seed "life-like" qualities._line_ Now, new research by England and a colleague suggests that physics may naturally produce self-replicating chemical reactions, one of the first steps toward creating life from inanimate substances._line_ This might be interpreted as life originating directly from the fundamental laws of nature, thereby removing luck from the equation. But that would be jumping the gun._line_ Life had to have come from something; there wasn\'t always biology. Biology is born from the raw and lifeless chemical components that somehow organized themselves into prebiotic compounds, created the building blocks of life, formed basic microbes and then eventually evolved into the spectacular array of creatures that exist on our planet today. [7 Theories on the Origin of Life]_line_ "Abiogenesis" is when something nonbiological turns into something biological and England thinks thermodynamics might provide the framework that drives life-like behavior in otherwise lifeless chemicals. However, this research doesn\'t bridge life-like qualities of a physical system with the biological processes themselves, England said._line_ "I would not say I have done anything to investigate the \'origin of life\' per se," England told Live Science. "I think what\'s interesting to me is the proof of principle \xe2\x80\x93 what are the physical requirements for the emergence of life-like behaviors?"_line_ When energy is applied to a system, the laws of physics dictate how that energy dissipates. If an external heat source is applied to that system, it will dissipate and reach thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, like a cooling cup of coffee left on a desk. Entropy, or the amount of disorder in the system, will increase as heat dissipates. But some physical systems may be sufficiently out of equilibrium that they "self-organize" to make best use of an external energy source, triggering interesting self-sustaining chemical reactions that prevent the system from reaching thermodynamic equilibrium and thus maintaining an out-of-equilibrium state, England speculates. (It\'s as if that cup of coffee spontaneously produces a chemical reaction that sustains a hotspot in the center of the fluid, preventing the coffee from cooling to an equilibrium state.) He calls this situation "dissipation-driven adaptation" and this mechanism is what drives life-like qualities in England\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise lifeless physical system._line_ A key life-like behavior is self-replication, or (from a biological viewpoint) reproduction. This is the basis for all life: It starts simple, replicates, becomes more complex and replicates again. It just so happens that self-replication is also a very efficient way of dissipating heat and increasing entropy in that system._line_ In a study published July 18 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, England and co-author Jordan Horowitz tested their hypothesis. They carried out computer simulations on a closed system (or a system that doesn\'t exchange heat or matter with its surroundings) containing a "soup" of 25 chemicals. Although their setup is very simple, a similar type of soup may have pooled on the surface of a primordial and lifeless Earth. If, say, these chemicals are concentrated and heated by an external source \xe2\x80\x93 a hydrothermal vent, for example \xe2\x80\x93 the pool of chemicals would need to dissipate that heat in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. Heat must dissipate and the entropy of the system will inevitably increase._line_ Under certain initial conditions, he found that these chemicals may optimize the energy applied to the system by self-organizing and undergoing intense reactions to self-replicate. The chemicals fine-tuned themselves naturally. These reactions generate heat that obeys the second law of thermodynamics; entropy will always increase in the system and the chemicals would self-organize and exhibit the life-like behavior of self-replication._line_ "Essentially, the system tries a bunch of things on a small scale, and once one of them starts experiencing positive feedback, it does not take that long for it to take over the character of organization in the system," England told Live Science._line_ This is a very simple model of what goes on in biology: chemical energy is burned in cells that are \xe2\x80\x93 by their nature \xe2\x80\x93 out of equilibrium, driving the metabolic processes that maintain life. But, as England admits, there\'s a big difference between finding life-like qualities in a virtual chemical soup and life itself._line_ Sara Imari Walker, a theoretical physicist and astrobiologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the current research, agrees._line_ "There\xe2\x80\x99s a two-way bridge that needs to be crossed to try to bridge biology and physics; one is to understand how you get life-like qualities from simple physical systems and the other is to understand how physics can give rise to life," Imari Walker told Live Science. "You need to do both to really understand what properties are unique to life and what properties are characteristic of things that you consider to be almost alive [\xe2\x80\xa6] like a prebiotic system."_line_ Before we can even begin to answer the big question of whether these simple physical systems may influence the emergence of life elsewhere in the universe, it would be better to understand where these systems exist on Earth first._line_ "If, when you say \'life,\' you mean stuff that is as stunningly impressive as a bacterium or anything else with polymerases and DNA, my work doesn\'t yet tell us anything about how easy or difficult it is to make something that complex, so I shouldn\'t speculate about what we\'d be likely to find elsewhere than Earth," England said. (Polymerases are proteins that assemble DNA and RNA.)_line_ This research doesn\'t specifically identify how biology emerges from nonbiological systems, only that in some complex chemical situations, surprising self-organization occurs. These simulations do not consider other life-like qualities \xe2\x80\x93 such as adaptation to environment or reaction to stimuli. Also, this thermodynamics test on a closed system does not consider the role of information reproduction in life\'s origins, said Michael L\xc3\xa4ssig, a statistical physicist and quantitative biologist at the University of Cologne in Germany._line_ "[This] work is indeed a fascinating result on non-equilibrium chemical networks but it is still a long way from a physics explanation of the origins of life, which requires the reproduction of information," L\xc3\xa4ssig, who was not involved in the research, told Live Science._line_ There\xe2\x80\x99s a critical role for information in living systems, added Imari Walker. Just because there appears to be natural self-organization exhibited by a soup of chemicals, it doesn\'t necessarily mean living organization._line_ "I think there\'s a lot of intermediate stages that we have to get through to go from simple ordering to having a full-on information processing architecture like a living cell, which requires something like memory and hereditary," said Imari Walker. "We can clearly get order in physics and non-equilibrium systems, but that doesn\'t necessarily make it life."_line_ To say England\'s work could be the "smoking gun" for the origin of life is premature, and there are many other hypotheses as to how life may have emerged from nothing, experts said. But it is a fascinating insight into how physical systems may self-organize in nature. Now that researchers have a general idea about how this thermodynamic system behaves, it would be a nice next step to identify sufficiently out-of-equilibrium physical systems that naturally occur on Earth, England said._line_'

S' Apart from teaching students, schools can lower their monthly electricity bill and also generate funds by selling excess power to the state grids._line_Kochi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in a circular has advised schools affiliated to it to set up solar panels on their premises in order to produce solar energy. The CBSE said that this is an era of non-conventional energy and children should be taught about it and examples should be set before them in the schools itself._line_\xe2\x80\x9cSolar energy is being harvested through solar panels and is now used in most of the government offices and commercial premises as a step towards use of clean energy for protecting the environment. The schools/educational institutions consume a lot of electricity for their daily functioning which is presently sourced from non-renewable sources which are the major sources of environmental pollution. The schools are also installing heavy duty generators which run on diesel towards power backup during load shedding which aggravates air pollution in cities,\xe2\x80\x9d the circular pointed out. _line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government, in order to promote the use of clean energy, has initiated National Solar Mission to control air pollution and to discourage the use of fossil fuels for energy needs. Therefore, CBSE affiliated schools consistent with the national policy initiative may also install solar panels in their premises at places like rooftop/vacant unused area of campus to meet their power needs and as power backup,\xe2\x80\x9d the CBSE has said._line_The CBSE also pointed out to schools that the use of solar energy in schools will creat awareness among the students about the use of renewable sources of energy, lower their monthly electricity bill and the schools can also generate funds by selling excess power to the state grids as per the government policy._line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe use of solar energy in schools will not only contribute to environmental sustainability and promote the habit of energy conservation among school children, but the cost savings will also contribute to the financial stability of schools in the years ahead. The affiliated schools of the board are, therefore, advised to take measures for maximum utilization and promotion of solar energy in schools,\xe2\x80\x9d the circular pointed out._line_St Philomena\xe2\x80\x99s Public School and Junior College, Elanji, Principal Fr John Erniakulath while welcoming the circular said that the absence of credible agencies in implementing solar projects is preventing schools from toeing such projects. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of dubious players who decamp with money after promising to implement solar power projects. I have heard that even the Cochin international airport which became the first airport in the world to be fully powered by solar had a bitter experience first in this regard.

Schools are in fact the ideal place to implement such projects as the roof tops are spacious enough to spread the solar panels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fr John Erniakulathil._line_\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it is a welcome step. However, small and medium schools will find it difficult to implement it as the cost for implementing solar scheme is expensive. The current subsidy is not enough to sustain such projects. _line_\xe2\x80\x9cMore than 50 per cent subsidy is needed for solar projects, then only small and medium schools will be attracted to it. Otherwise, large schools alone will be able to implement them.

So, the exact cause of death would be known only after that, though no injury marks were found on his body.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will take another 3-4 day for the report to come to us.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Meanwhile, the Forest Department has clarified in a press note that The Indian Express report dated August 28 had incorrectly stated that one more accused, Devidas, Kumre, had earlier escaped their custody. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had escaped while our staffers were trying to catch him along with one more accused,\xe2\x80\x9d a clarification issued by the Department said. On that occasion, too, people from his native Usri paar village had accused the Forest Department of beating him up leading to fracture in leg. The Forest Department had said the fractured was suffered when Kumre fell down while running away. Kumre had also stated before the court to the same effect._line_'

Wassily Kandinsky\'s paintings were influenced by his intellectual views on color, symbolism and spiritualism, and he is as well-known for his avant-garde theories on aesthetics in addition to his technical excellence as a painter. _line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Early Life_line_Wassily Wassilyevich was born in Moscow in December of 1866, the son of Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky, a successful tea merchant whose Siberian ancestry extended further east to Asiatic royalty. Although his father groomed him for a career in law, Kandinsky was tutored in both piano and cello as a young boy and took further instruction in drawing from a private coach. His fascination for color (to which he assigned a mysterious life) and its subsequent psychological effects was to remain with him into his adulthood. _line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Life in Law_line_Kandinsky enrolled at the Law Faculty of Moscow University in 1886 and went on to graduate with honors six years later. He married his cousin Anna Chimyakina upon receiving his degree and began teaching at his alma mater as an associate professor. However, his interest in art was abiding and his free time was often spent in studies of regional folk styles. Through those years spent at the university, he was culturally involved \xe2\x80\x94 a connoisseur of both art and music. The deep resonance he felt for both Claude Monet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHaystacks\xe2\x80\x9d and Richard Wagner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLohengrin\xe2\x80\x9d informed the drastic change in his life he would soon make. In 1896, Kandinsky was selected to be a professor in the Department of Law at Derpt University in Tartu, but the appointment was short-lived and he gave up economics and law to study art in Munich._line_Wassily Kandinsky in Munich_line_Kandinsky settled in Munich in 1896 and began studying at Anton Azbe\'s private school, but his instruction in line drawing and composition did not stimulate him. After being kept on the same level for more than a year, he left Azbe\xe2\x80\x99s Institute for a place at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he would study under Franz Stuck, a prominent graphic artist. _line_Stuck was impressed with Kandinsky\xe2\x80\x99s work, but feared that his palette was too bright. As basic but integral training in form, he insisted that Kandinsky paint exclusively in black-and-white. In the following year, we see an evolution in the artist\xe2\x80\x99s scope, but his relationship with his wife grew strained, and by 1903 he was divorced. _line_Wassily Kandinsky Travels with Gabriele_line_The end of his marriage resulted in Kandinsky\xe2\x80\x99s five years of travel across Europe with a young artist named Gabriele M\xc3\xbcnter. After participating in exhibitions in Tunisia, Holland and France, the couple settled in the small town of Murnau in the Bavarian Alps. It was the start of a prolific and intense period of activity, full of reminiscences of a forgotten Romantic era. Vividly colored landscapes of dreamed and real worlds, dramatic in their strong lines and primal energy dominated his pieces from this time, along with planes and forms that were disintegrated and dematerialized, familiar objects made unfamiliar and therefore more essential. They are cited as the first abstract paintings in history. While creating this new language, Kandinsky also wrote and published a dissertation about his experiments and musings titled, \xe2\x80\x9cConcerning the Spiritual in Art.\xe2\x80\x9d _line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Movement towards Abstraction_line_Kandinsky\xe2\x80\x99s early expressionist paintings throb with brilliant colors much like by the Fauvists, who celebrated color over form. This primacy to color over form hinted at the future abstraction to come. While the stress on color by Fauvists set the early stage of abstraction, it was Kandinsky who took it to the culmination point. His painting started to employ pure color and resembled the structure of symphonies, which communicated to the senses of the viewers. But Kandinsky\xe2\x80\x99s art moved beyond abstraction. His ambition was to evoke multiple senses through his art, for example, evoke sound through images. To achieve this, he banished all figures from his canvas and developed a visual language filled with stars and marks of colors that denoted the musical notes. It\xe2\x80\x99s said that Kandinsky had synesthesia, and he wanted to replicate the synesthetic effects through his paintings. He used colors and marks to evoke sounds and music in his viewers. Even though it\'s not established that Kandinsky had synaesthesia, it can be safely suggested that the relationship between sound and color was an integral part of his oeuvre._line_Supposedly Kandinsky had the first experience of his synesthesia during a performance of Wagner\'s opera "Lohengrin" in Moscow. He wrote, "Wild, almost crazy lines were sketched in front of me." In Germany, he came in contact with Arnold Schoenberg in 1911. After listening to a concert in which Schoenberg employed atonal composition method, Kandinsky finished \xe2\x80\x9cImpression III (Konzert)\xe2\x80\x9d in two days. Later he befriended Schoenberg and wrote a letter to him in which he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe independent progress through their own destinies, the independent life of the individual voices in your compositions, is exactly what I am trying to find in my paintings.\xe2\x80\x9d He also wrote that the new art has to be constructed that is anti-geometric and anti-logical and integrates dissonances within it. _line_In 1911, Kandinsky had also set Der Blaue Reiter in Munich with Franz Marc, August Macke, Albert Bloch and others. The name Blaue Reiter meant "blue rider" and it was based on the leitmotif of the horse and rider in Kandinsky\xe2\x80\x99s work. The dynamic image of the horse and rider suggested a movement away from realism to abstraction. In Marc\'s works, the horse was an emblem of rebirth. Kandinsky also loved the color blue. He wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe deeper the blue becomes, more strongly it calls man towards the infinite, awakening in him a desire for the pure and, finally, for the supernatural." The group of artists shared common values and believed in abstract forms and rich colors, which had spiritual properties for them. The colors, they believed, could also neutralize the ill-effects of the rampant corruption and materialism of the time._line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Return to Russia_line_The beginning of the World War forced Kandinsky to leave Germany for Switzerland in 1914, but a parting of ways with Gabriele soon had him back in his hometown of Moscow by the end of the year. He met Nina Andreevskaya, the daughter of a general, in 1916 and married her in February of the next year. _line_The revolutionary years in Russia saw him alternate between half-abstract phrasing and Impressionistic landscapes, his steady evolution unbroken by social and political unrest. He became involved with art education and museum reform, and designed curricula based on his previously stated analyses in his treatise. But his views were not those of the intellectual intelligentsia at the time, and constant attacks from his colleagues forced him to move back to Germany at the end of 1921. _line_Wassily Kandinsky in Bauhaus _line_Kandinsky joined the faculty of Bauhaus in 1923, where his work adopted a more scientific basis. He developed a precise, detailed idiom of points and lines that worked with and against each other to create shapes, figures, and curves over which cool, sweeping colors hung. The language was one born of both research and expression, meant to project the intuitive, psychic reality that exists at a different frequency. Unfortunately, by 1931, the Nazis in Germany launched their full-scale campaign against the school and it was shut down the following year. Art lovers can buy Wassily Kandinsky\'s artworks online._line_Kandinsky had painted over 150 oils and 300 watercolors during his time at Bauhaus, but many of his works were lost when the Nazis condemned them as degenerate and set them ablaze. _line_Kandinsky and his wife spent the rest of their lives in France, where he continued to paint and theorize until his death in 1944. _line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Exhibitions_line_2006 - Tate Modern, London_line_2011 - Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York_line_2012 - Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam_line_2012 - National Gallery of Scotland_line_2013 - Guggenheim Museum, New York_line_2013 - Neue Galerie, New York_line_2014 - Milwaukee Art Museum, Wisconsin_line_Wassily Kandinsky\'s Collection/Museums_line_Art Institute of Chicago_line_Dallas Museum of Art, Texas_line_Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco_line_Guggenheim Museum, New York City_line_Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia_line_Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York_line_Museum of Modern Art, New York_line_Tate Gallery, London_line_National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C._line_Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice_line_Books/Publications _line_\xe2\x80\x9cConcerning the Spiritual in Art\xe2\x80\x9d by Wassily Kandinsky_line_\xe2\x80\x9cPoint and Line to Plane\xe2\x80\x9d by Wassily Kandinsky_line_\xe2\x80\x9cKandinsky\xe2\x80\x9d by Hajo Duchting_line_\xe2\x80\x9cWassily Kandinsky, 1866-1944: A revolution in Painting\xe2\x80\x9d by Hajo Duchting_line_\xe2\x80\x9cKandinsky\xe2\x80\x9d by Vivian Endicott Barnett and Christian Derouet_line_'

S'Post written by_line_Vikram Rajan_line_Vikram Rajan is the co-founder of phoneBlogger.net and of Raviate, the word-of-mouth marketing automation app._line_Shutterstock_line_In a previous article, I explored the top overlooked benefits of getting testimonials. But it\xe2\x80\x99s often better to give than to receive. You may be surprised by all your business can gain simply by giving someone a testimonial._line_Reciprocity_line_As the expression goes, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The more you rave about others, the more others will rave about you. One of the easiest ways to get a testimonial is first to give a testimonial. Of course, sometimes this literally can\xe2\x80\x99t be achieved._line_While there are many types of testimonials, they are most commonly given by customers._line_But authentic appreciation from professional to professional goes a long way. Raving about someone is a great way to open, nurture and deepen a relationship. _line_Done appropriately, giving someone a testimonial is a sure way to co-opt influence. While they may not literally reciprocate, they may be more willing to introduce you to others and open opportunities for you. Of course, reciprocity should be serendipitous \xe2\x80\x94 not expected._line_Role Modeling_line_When you give someone a testimonial, you remind yourself of what you value. How can you earn such a raving testimonial? Perhaps you need to highlight what you\xe2\x80\x99ve affirmed, or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s an area for improvement yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99ll able to use that person (or business) as a role model._line_No one is perfect; no business is perfect. As such, we must have multiple role models for all of the different roles we play personally and professionally. We can have role models for each type of testimonial. _line_It may not be necessary (or appreciated) to give each role model a testimonial. But when you do, share that you not only admire them, but that you also seek to emulate them. What a compliment!_line_Recognition_line_I recently shared the value of being a connector. The same can be said of uplifters: When you praise someone, your audience not only holds that other person in high regard; they also think highly of you. They recognize you as a person who appreciates others. The opposite is often true: It\xe2\x80\x99s advised to \xe2\x80\x9cnever trust anyone who is rude to a waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_You can also earn recognition from within the testimonial itself. I call it the \xe2\x80\x9cTestimonial Name Dropping\xe2\x80\x9d hack: When raving about your colleague, mention your name and/or business. You may as well benefit from giving a testimonial._line_These surprising benefits should not be ulterior motives for giving a testimonial. Rather, these should encourage you to give more testimonials, more often. Beyond these three, there is a fourth hidden benefit: It\xe2\x80\x99s personally rewarding. When you rave about others, you feel good about yourself, and you inspire yourself to do good in other ways._line_Relationships_line_You can rave about someone in many ways, for many reasons, many times over. Testimonials come in various formats: voice recorded, by video, in person and of course written (emailed or, nowadays, text messaged). A colleague hearing a compliment from you by voicemail can be a delightful surprise amidst a deluge of email._line_You can rave about someone for multiple reasons. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a brainstorming tool you can use to provide a testimonial for someone in your network every day of the week:_line_Mondays: Who are your VIP relationships \xe2\x80\x94 e.g., referral sources and confidants? Rave about their value to you._line_Tuesdays: Who or what business provides a great service or product? Rave about what they do._line_Wednesdays: Rave about someone\xe2\x80\x99s great work ethic or outstanding ideas._line_Thursdays: Who or what business is underappreciated or a \xe2\x80\x9cbest-kept secret?\xe2\x80\x9d Rave about them on social media._line_Fridays: Congratulate or celebrate someone\xe2\x80\x99s achievement (check in your LinkedIn notifications for these announcements)._line_Saturdays: Who have you lost touch with? Surprise them with an unexpected weekend accolade._line_Sundays: Who does good for others, donates time to charity or leads a nonprofit or fundraiser?_line_You can \xe2\x80\x94 and should \xe2\x80\x94 give the same person multiple testimonials. Instead of one long-winded testimonial, keep it short and simple. You make a more memorable impression through repetition, while also giving the recipient multiple opportunities to promote themselves. Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s a benefit for both of you.

S' A new study cautions about the dangers of excessive sedentary behavior and TV watching among seniors.  _line_The new study was led by Dr. Loretta DiPietro, chair of the Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at the George Washington University\'s Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington, D.C., and the findings were published in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences._line_Dr. DiPietro and colleagues examined data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study - the largest study of its kind to date, which was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to better understand the link between diet and health. _line_The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study comprised of almost 340,000 men and over 226,000 women living in six states and two metropolitan areas in the United States. The participants were all aged between 50 and 71 and were predominantly white. _line_At baseline, in 1995-1996, the study participants were healthy. Dr. DiPietro and team kept track of the sedentary behavior and exercising habits of 134,269 of these participants, recording how much TV they watched and how much physical activity they did. _line_Additionally, the researchers recorded what kind of activity the participants engaged in - for example, whether it was vigorous-intensity physical activity or whether they did gardening, housework, or other. _line_TV watching raises walking disability risk _line_The researchers clinically followed the participants for about 10 years, or until 2006, when the NIH-AARP study ended. By this point, almost 30 percent of the participants who were healthy at the beginning of the study developed a walking disability, described as being either "unable to walk" or walking at an "easy usual pace," defined as less than 2 miles per hour (mph). _line_After performing a multivariable logistic regression analysis and adjusting for factors known to increase the risk of mobility disability, the researchers found that "greater TV time was significantly related to increased disability within all levels of physical activity."_line_More specifically, participants who watched TV for 5 or more hours every day were 65 percent more likely to have a walking disability 10 years down the line, compared with their counterparts who watched TV for less than 2 hours every day. _line_Additionally, high levels of total sitting and TV time, when combined with 3 hours or less of weekly physical activity, had a particularly negative effect, drastically increasing the risk of a mobility disability. _line_"TV viewing is a very potent risk factor for disability in older age [...] Sitting and watching TV for long periods (especially in the evening) has got to be one of the most dangerous things that older people can do because they are much more susceptible to the damages of physical inactivity."_line_Dr. Loretta DiPietro_line_Strengths and limitations of the study_line_A major strength of the research, the authors write, is that it studied participants prospectively over a decade, unlike previous studies, which have only performed a cross-sectional analysis. _line_Additionally, this is the first time that a study examined the sitting time jointly with physical activity and the associations these two have with mobility disability. _line_However, Dr. DiPietro and colleagues also point out some limitations of their research. Firstly, all the data on physical activity and sedentary habits were self-reported, which allows for potential bias. That is, people usually report that they spend more time exercising than they do in reality. _line_Also, given the interdependence between sitting and being active 0 that is, given that "time in one [behavior] displaces time in another" - the researchers concede that other statistical methods such as "compositional data analysis techniques and isotemporal modeling" may have been better suited for this analysis. _line_Finally, because the sample used for the study was predominantly white and had a higher educational background, the researchers caution that their findings may not be generalizable to the wider American senior population. _line_Still, says Dr. DiPietro, "Our findings suggest that older people who want to remain fit must ramp up their daily physical activity and reduce the amount of time they spend sitting."_line_'

S"Traveling with kids? Use our checklist!_line_ Make your travel blissful with children and especially babies, by being fully-equipped with all the essential things like a baby stroller, a nasal aspirator and a breast pump, say experts._line_ Experts have listed a few ways to make your life easier:_line_ * Carry baby stroller and move around freely: A lightweight, durable, baby stroller that reclines quickly is the best solution while travelling. Even if you are shopping, or are busy with something, you can place the baby in the stroller and enjoy the moment. _line_ However make sure that you do not expose your child to direct sunlight or cold weather while strolling around. _line_ * Do not forget to keep baby products like soft, gentle moisturizing cream & wipes to keep the baby fresh & clean all the time. Avoid all the harsh soaps and lotions that may harm the baby's skin and may cause skin allergy, eczema or rashes. _line_ * Use inflatable mattress for cars to ensure baby's comfort. You can use a car mattress that offers space to the child to move around or crawl freely. Inflatable mattresses are a perfect solution. These mattresses are portable, easy to carry and lets your baby sleep without the chances of falling in between the seats._line_ * Keep a health-check with contactless infrared thermometer. The contactless infrared thermometer works on the advanced technology and measures temperature from a distance of 3 to 5 cm. It also keeps a record of the last 30-32 temperatures. _line_ Apart from this, the thermometer can measure temperatures of various surfaces and liquids. _line_ * Since babies are prone to infections, always try to maintain hygiene. Change their clothes frequently so that there is no breeding ground for bacteria which may affect their skin and body adversely. Watch out for symptoms like rashes and red bumps. _line_ * Store baby food and milk powder in safe leak proof containers. Go with containers made from food grade polypropylene which is not-easily deformable._line_ * The change of weather may have a drastic effect on the health of the baby. A nasal aspirator is highly effective to let your baby breathe easily when you are out. _line_ If the baby is ill, a nasal aspirator is a great product to clear the stuffy nose and congestion. Buy an aspirator that has spare seals, run on battery so that you can carry it along. _line_ * Since you may feel uncomfortable in feeding the child openly, breast pumps come handy. Available in manual as well as electric form, breast pumps have removable elements that are easy to transport and assemble. _line_"

S' PATNA: With less than a month left for Durga Puja, city artists have started making clay idols of the Goddess in full swing. _line_ Busy making a Durga idol outside his house in Natraj Gali, 28-year-old Suresh Pandit said he had received orders from five puja committees this year. "Depending on the size, idols cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000. Everything has become expensive, but people want to pay the same price they have been paying for ages. Profit, therefore, is meagre," rued Suresh. _line_  His uncle Shiv Chandra Pandit, who was helping Suresh in his work, said, "A tractor full of soil, which was available for Rs 4,000 a few years ago, costs Rs 10,000 now. Even the bamboo and the strings used in making the idols have become costlier. All we earn from one idol is Rs 2,000." _line_ Apart from Durga Puja, Suresh and Shiv also make idols for Saraswati Puja. "I grew up in a family where everyone took up idol making as a profession. However, I will not like my kids to do this work," Suresh, who also sells earthen vessels, told TOI. _line_ Another city-based artist Jitender Kumar, a graduate who is also pursuing computer designing course, said he prepared the idols of Goddess Durga along with other gods, demons and animals. "A set of idols costs Rs 55,000 and I usually earn a profit of Rs 15,000". _line_ Many artists from West Bengal have also come to the state capital. Jagannath Pal from Kolkata who has been making idols for the famous Durga Puja pandal at Dak Bungalow said eight artists, who would work under him, had arrived two months back. "Apart from Dak Bungalow, we will be making idols for other localities like Churi Market and Danapur in Patna and one in Hajipur. We also add jewellery and paint and charge Rs 1 lakh for a set of idols. The cost goes up depending on the size and number of statues," he added. _line_ Pal further said he hired the artists and labourers by paying them money in advance. "Labour cost differs from person to person. Some are paid Rs 500 for a day while some get Rs 3,000 for a day\'s work. Food and lodging expense is borne by me. All I earn is Rs 2 lakh in more than three months. This is the main earning for a year," said Pal and added when the festival season was over, he did fibre painting to be put on walls. _line_'

"However, we note event risks related to conflicts in the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea, and the Middle East." _line_"The test firing of missiles by North Korea, intensification of aggressive rhetoric on both sides, and a hardline stance from the Trump administration have raised the risk of a conflict in the Korean Peninsula." _line_The agency also said there appeared to be "renewed momentum" to address bilateral trade issues that the Donald Trump administration deemed as unfair trade practices, which could hurt growth if wide-ranging measures were introduced. _line_For markets, it warned of risks of increased volatility due to historically elevated asset prices and broad investor expectations that interest rates would remain low even as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank said they were preparing to start rolling back unconventional stimulus. _line_While raising its China forecasts, the agency warned the economy has become increasingly reliant on new debt to foster growth. The agency downgraded China\'s ratings by one notch to A1 in May, saying the financial strength of the economy would erode in coming years. _line_The agency revised its India forecast slightly lower to 7.1 percent as the government\'s demonetisation move last year led to several months of acute shortages for manufacturing and construction firms in particular, although it said it expected the impact to ease in coming months. _line_Reporting by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Jacqueline Wong_line_Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles._line_'
