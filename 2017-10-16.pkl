VCastigates Govt for creating \u2018fear psychosis\u2019 among people .  KNS . Srinagar, Oct 09 (KNS): Peoples Democratic Front (PDF) Chairman and MLA Khansahib, Hakeem Muhammad Yaseen Monday castigated the PDP-BJP government for its failure to check mysterious braid chopping incidents in various parts of the Valley. In a statement issued to KNS, he said government has no right to be in place as it has utterly failed to remove fear among the people especially woman folk due to braid chopping incidents.  Hakeem has termed braid chopping incidents in various parts of the Kashmir valley as \u2018an insult to the respect of the womanhood\u2019.  He said increasing braid chopping incidents have put dignity of the sacred women at stake, which is totally unacceptable and unbearable. .  \u201cIt was most unfortunate and shameful that a sinister game plan has been leashed against our sisters and daughters who are scared to move out of their homes for routine work,\u201d MLA Khansahib said.  Hakeem Yaseen has said that the increasing incidents of braid chopping in various parts of the valley have put a question mark on the credibility of the present Government adding that the prevailing situation has upset the peace of mind of the people of Kashmir valley especially woman folk . \u201c one fails to understand why the Govt. is acting like mute spectator despite having a huge police and intelligence apparatus in its hands ,\u201d, Hakeem questioned adding that the finger of suspicion directly points towards the Government for the episode for reasons known to it.  Expressing serious concern over the continuous incidents of Braid Chopping, Hakeem Yaseen has said that the Government has utterly failed to un earth mystery behind such ugly and shameful incidents . He said the present Government has bitterly failed to provide a safe and secure atmosphere to the people of the state adding that the fresh spell of mysterious braid chopping incidents have added to the woes of the already security scared people of the valley . He said the present coalition Government has no right to be in place as it has failed to protect life and property of the people from the anti national elements and has also failed to come up to their expectations.  Hakeem Yaseen has demanded effective measures on war footing basis to identity the culprits behind braid chopping incidents and to punish them. (KNS).

VWhy I posit the above is for this reason:. Back in May of 2014 I penned the article: \u201cDid Apple Just Become Microsoft?\u201d In it I made the following points. To wit:. \u201cHowever since the passing of Jobs, quite rightly, there has been an intense spotlight focused squarely on the Apple tradition going forward. Just what new products or changes to existing lines would be forth coming, and how will they be packaged for sale to an ever-increasing market. Everyone (and I mean everyone) understood that the new management structure at Apple would both need to pay homage to the ever-present shadow of Jobs while also needing to blaze or create new trails free of the ominous Jobs overhang. i.e., Something Jobs would say, \u201cWow, I never thought of that!\u201d as compared with nothing more than a refinement to an already Jobs inspired creation. However, it would seem we not only have the latter taking place, but is veering way off the path Apple has been so skillful in avoiding: Buying an also ran business. e.g., The Beats\u2122 headphone line. Some say it\u2019s for it\u2019s streaming music service or some other thing but if that is the case, not putting the money into a true revamp of iTunes seems even more as an un-Jobs move.\u201d. And here we are nearly 4 years later (or 4 product cycles, if you will) and what has been the result of this once \u201cfantastic\u201d partnership? When was the last time you heard anything or any buzz about Beats®? ____________ (insert crickets here.). Oh, but wait you say, \u201cWhat about iTunes? It was updated as to allow easier downloading of apps and such for mobile.\u201d. Yes, yes it was. An update that most users will only encounter when they go to update or purchase something, then, find out they can\u2019t do it the way they\u2019ve been doing for-e-ver. i.e., \u201cOh, wait, I have to do this on my phone now, and not my computer? Wait, how do I\u2026? Wait\u2026what\u2026I mean\u2026WTF!\u201d. I believe this to be a blatant design faux pa. Why? Because if you look at the iTunes of today, it looks no different that it did years, and years ago. The only difference? The \u201cApps\u201d option is no longer there. This is to \u201creduce clutter\u201d via Apple\u2019s thinking. But the same old, tired, antiquated looking and seemingly lifeless iTunes of old? It\u2019s still there, but now with less clutter \u2013 so you can see more clearly how lame it has become due to design atrophy. Most will only notice the \u201credesign\u201d when they go to use it the way they\u2019ve been using it habitually, only to find it no longer is possible. And the design cues that would intuitively make someone take notice immediately, that maybe there\u2019s something new going on? That too is completely absent. Along with the old way of doing it. In my opinion, that\u2019s such a design faux pa it\u2019s unconscionable, especially, for any company where \u201cdesign\u201d is so front and center. (Please don\u2019t tell me about the little pop up to tell you somethings \u201cnew.\u201d Again, please! If that\u2019s the extent for \u201cdesign?\u201d I\u2019ll just leave it at that.). It (meaning iTunes) looks, feels, and performs (as in it\u2019s completely outdated and still clunky to the point of frustrating) as the same old, same old, old iTunes it\u2019s been since Jobs passed. Sorry, but I still can not get over just how pathetic this all so important portal to one of the most important selling points Apple has to both consumers, developers, and Wall Street has become. Hint: Ecosystem is (or was) for all intents and purposes the iTunes portal to everything Apple. Period. Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean that Apple (aka \u201cCook and company\u201d) didn\u2019t make sweeping changes and innovations to many of Apple\u2019s once empirical red lines. Again, from the same article To wit. One of the first signs that Cook and company were going to do things very differently was when they announced that Apple which had for years steered clear of donating or giving away resources (as in donations) abruptly reversed Jobs stance and stated very publicly they would now begin contributing to education and other charities. Whether one agrees with this decision or not is irrelevant. It was the first very public statement showing there was a true sea change transpiring in Cupertino. I myself wrote about this and more that it seemed to be shaping up to look more concerned for public image in the eyes of political groups as well as Wall Street than anything else. It\u2019s beginning to look like both my concerns as well as others might be coming into fruition.\u201d. Here\u2019s a little more from the same article, for a bit more context, because it\u2019s germane to this discussion. Again, to wit:. \u201cNext is what has been seen by many as a complete and utter cave in to Wall Street. In what seems like a total collapse to these outside pressures it was announced at the last earnings report the new product line wasn\u2019t consumer product based: it was now products for Wall Street with new improvements and features unfathomable under Jobs tenure. Dividends, debt, splits, and more. I don\u2019t think the iPhone has added as many new features at once as the new features released in Apple the stock. And here we are, again, nearly 4 years later and what has been the empirical evidence that my assumptions were correct? Once again, to wit:. And how about that \u201cpolitical\u201d argument I brought forth? . Surely no CEO worth-their-salt would ever be seen throwing not only himself, but his company, along with its employees into the political fray intentionally. Especially when the evidence for it clearly showed the accusations were a bit more than specious. Again, what prudent CEO would ever willingly set up an \u201cus vs them\u201d to be played out within its customer base? I mean that\u2019s Business 101, correct? Well, it is, but it\u2019s now also Silicon Valley 2.0, which has become anything but a fundamental business ethos. And this is Cook and Co., not Jobs and crew. Here are a few headlines to ponder. To wit:. Don\u2019t like that headline? Fair enough, you can see it, as well as be asked for it in, da, da, da, dahhhh: iTunes itself. To wit:. (Screenshot from above noted source). Some are thinking right now, \u201cI thought it was about Nazi\u2019s, not pro-life?\u201d Yes, that\u2019s what was touted, but that\u2019s the problem when one decides to do anything via the political, for sometimes, more often than not, you don\u2019t know whom \u2013 is in bed \u2013 with whom. That\u2019s why the business default is always to not involve yourself, at least publicly. (Remember: the accusations, along with the evidence for it was iffy to begin with, and proved to be completely untrue when examined rationally away from the political eye.). To be clear: what one does in private is another matter entirely. But the cardinal rule of business is, has, and should remain: Never, ever, ever (did I say never?) openly involve your company, employees, and their collective coffers into the political. Period. Full stop. Once you add the political to business \u2013 you\u2019re not only asking for troubling, but your courting it. And what\u2019s worse is this: Just like the old saying of \u201cThe camel\u2019s nose under the tent.\u201d Once it sticks its nose in, more of it, and in greater quantity, will follow till eventually there\u2019s nothing left inside but the camel. If you believe there\u2019s any doubt to that scenario just look to the current debacle within not only the NFL®, but ESPN\u2122 and sports in general. Ratings, ticket sales, and more are being boycotted in one form or another, in droves. (something I stated in 2015 would result when everyone else said otherwise). And the worst is far from over, because these entities are doubling down on the political even further. i.e., They\u2019re confusing the political uproar as some form of \u201croar from the field,\u201d and playing too it. The issue is, that \u201croar\u201d could very well spell \u201cThe End\u201d of what had been a near magical run. No comparison for Apple you say, as in, apples-and-oranges? Fair enough, so explain this, again, to wit:. The above screenshot image was taken from the Zero Hedge\u2122 article, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Just China: No Lines For New iPhone 8 Virtually Anywhere\u201d. And just to put the above into further context. Here\u2019s a pull quote from the afore-mentioned article, again, to wit:. \u201cAccording to CBS LA, the Pasadena store was also missing a line of eager fans. Previous releases of the iPhone attracted hundreds of Apple fans waiting in the early morning hours at several stores across Southern California. The Apple Store has a ticketing system, but that never stopped eager iPhone fans from camping out overnight. But on Friday morning, all was quiet on Colorado Boulevard, except for employees inside the store handing out tickets.\u201d. I know it\u2019s possibly a little bit of a stretch, but it has to be asked: Do you think that maybe there were a few people who were just a little bit ticked off at Apple\u2019s new-found political stance, and maybe decided they would take a stand and not show up for Apple\u2019s newest \u201cshiny thing?\u201d. If it was just one, that\u2019s infinitely more than what did show up since Mr. Cook\u2019s new declaration for Apple\u2019s political involvement. (i.e., as in 1 paying customer is infinitely better than none.). People (especially the next-in-rotation fund-manger crowd) are attributing that it\u2019s because they\u2019re all waiting for the \u201cX.\u201d Fair point, but that doesn\u2019t mean some customers aren\u2019t unhappy. And let\u2019s remember: no one knows at this point, it has to all be speculated. But here\u2019s the real issue: the only thing to use as evidence to build any theory \u2013 is this latest roll out. And so far disaster seems to be an understatement. And the proximity of Mr. Cook\u2019s political stance, along with call for action, combined with the empirical results showing up in other venues of business elsewhere? Are you beginning to see my point?. Apple the stock is currently teetering in \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d territory. Any damage to its \u201cperfection\u201d thesis gets multiplied exponentially. Multiplied as in \u201cprofit takers\u201d show up in droves at the sell window, not the sales counter at first sign that the thesis is indeed hindered. Should this take place with Apple\u2019s continuous lack of innovations, dumbing down of existing products (see any forum of Apple power users) and continuing focus on both Tim Cook, his political stances, along with his pushing the involvement of Apple the company, its employees, and coffers into the political fray, simultaneously against a backdrop of uninspiring (think Pencil®), clichéd (think: any Apple presentation), openly mocked, (think: when demos were conducted on stage via Microsoft employees) laughed at, (think: CNET\u2122 live coverage of any event) as well as live product demos gone wrong, (think: face recognition) displays on the world stage. This is a string of \u201chits\u201d no one any wants, especially current share holders. Should the stock now falter, along with any iPhone rumblings confirming sales numbers will look like what the latest roll out last month foretold? Watch how fast things not only change from the narrative of \u201cgreat stewardship,\u201d but calls for management change begin to bubble to the surface in unison. In my opinion, Tim Cook really doesn\u2019t have a lot things to hang-his-hat on, along with hold-his-chair, but for Apple\u2019s stock price under his tutelage. Everything else since the passing of Jobs has been nothing more than a derivative of what Jobs had already begun or envisioned for the near future. And some will say that derivative has been more of a dumbing down of the original products, rather than a raising the bar. See \u201cHow Apple Is Giving Design A Bad Name\u201d for clues. These are not the types of things one wants to think of when thinking about Apple, yet, it\u2019s coming more front-and-center, and front-of-mind daily. Using myself as an example, for I am still an Apple user: I just replaced and upgraded two of my Macs. That upgrade consisted of upgrading two older models \u2013 to two 2012 models. Spending 3 times the price to only get only a negligible, or rather, imperceptible performance difference seemed ludicrous. The issue? I can afford the newest, and didn\u2019t even bother. How many are like me I have to wonder. I\u2019ll garner there are more than even I think. The only thing that has helped hold up, or bolster, Apple\u2019s mythical overhang of design excellence instilled under Jobs these years since he passed has been its current share price. Lose the share price plateau? The mythical overhang falls way with it. Why? Because it\u2019s just not there. Again, for this is far too important of a point: it\u2019s been the CEO, Tim Cook himself, that has not just allowed, but pushed all of this front-and-center as to now be included into any, and all, calculations of sales and valuations. Think about that very carefully, it\u2019s that important, as well as a mind-boggling foolish CEO misstep from a business viewpoint. It could very well be Mr. Cook made a political calculation which may result in not just bad timing, but also, a step too far. And one that leads him himself out the very door he entered, unable to fill the shoes for innovation which are sorely missed. Sometimes, nothing focuses the mind like a crisis \u2013 and maybe what Apple desperately needs is something to focus on besides its management resting on its laurels, and stock options, all while looking out upon vistas from within its own big new \u201cshiny thing\u201d they now call home to contemplate what politically calculated move is to be made next. Maybe it\u2019s time to focus on the product, rather than the political. Or maybe better yet\u2026. Hoist out a pirate flag, plant it, and actually do something under it other than contemplate which new superlative will be used to describe a stylus.

VBILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages. . Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee. . The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday. . The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors. . Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. \u201cWe are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,\u201d he said. . Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf. . Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States. . The tropical depression\u2019s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida\u2019s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts. . Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi. . In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot. . Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D\u2018Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi. . \u201cI\u2018m just glad,\u201d he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. \u201cI was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can\u2019t stop it.\u201d . Water flowed through Ursula Staten\u2019s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house. . \u201cI have a mess,\u201d the retired massage therapist said. \u201cIf we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.\u201d .  Lighthouse Pier is seen damaged by Hurricane Nate, in Biloxi, Mississippi, U.S., October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman . At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry. . Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate. . But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges. . U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief. . Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said. . Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it. . Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said. .

VMinister detained for paying Rs 4 crore to Maoists to kill rival. Minister detained for paying Rs 4 crore to Maoists to kill rival. National Investigation Agency on Sunday detained Jharkhand\u2019s former minister Gopal Krishna Patar for reportedly paying Rs 4 crore to Maoists to kill rival Ramesh Singh Munda. Search at Patar\u2019s premises was on and he would soon be formally arrested, an official said. Munda was shot dead nine years ago by Maoists, whose local leader, also the main suspect, recently surrendered. Patar, better known as Raja Peter, paid Rs 4 crore to the Maoists, who were upset with Munda over his frequent outbursts against them. \u201cSearches are on at three premises in Jharkhand in connection with the case. Soon we will formally arrest Raja Peter,\u201d an official said. The anti-terrorism probe agency has also detained assistant sub-inspector Sheshnath Singh, who was part of Munda\u2019s security detail. A former minister, Munda was shot dead in the Bundu town of his Maoist-hit Tamar constituency on July 9, 2008. Almost nine years, the investigation barely made progress as Pahan was on the run. The probe picked up pace after he gave himself up to police in May this year. He lost twice to Munda, in the 2000 and 2005 assembly elections. But in the by-election called after Munda\u2019s murder, Peter scored a stunning victory in Tamar. He defeated chief minister Shibu Soren, forcing him to resign. Minister detained for paying Rs 4 crore to Maoists to kill rival. According to Pahan it was Peter who bankrolled the operation,\u201d the official said. Pahan was paid the promised Rs 4 crore but instead of handing over the money to his bosses, he kept most of it for himself, the NIA official said. Peter was not the only one baying for Munda\u2019s blood, he said. The rebels also wanted him dead for his anti-Maoist remarks and their central committee had decided to eliminate Munda, the official said.

V (CNN)The man charged with kidnapping a Chinese student at the University of Illinois may face the death penalty after new charges were filed, accusing him of killing her. Brendt Christensen, 28, has been charged with kidnapping resulting in the death of Yingying Zhang, 26, according to an updated indictment released Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Illinois. Christensen was initially charged with kidnapping Zhang, but the updated indictment claims he kidnapped and "intentionally killed" her. The complaint alleges Christensen killed Zhang during "the commission of a kidnapping," and that the offense he committed which caused her to die was committed in an "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse," according to court documents. If convicted of this charge, Christensen could face either life in prison or the death penalty, according to a statement from the office of the US attorney for the central district of Illinois. Christensen's attorney did not immediately return CNN's calls for comment. Christensen was initially charged with Zhang's kidnapping, but not her death. He pleaded not guilty to the initial kidnapping charge on July 20. The updated indictment also charges Christensen with two counts of making false statements to the FBI when questioned about Zhang, according to court documents. Zhang disappeared June 9 while on her way to sign an apartment lease. Law enforcement officials believe she is dead, according to a criminal complaint filed before Christensen was arrested on June 30. She was last seen getting into Christensen's car at a bus stop, according to court documents, citing video evidence. Police still have not located Zhang's body, according to Sharon Paul, spokeswoman for the US attorney for the central district of Illinois. Kidnapping suspect seen at victim's vigil. The charges state that Christensen lied to the FBI about what he was doing the day Zhang disappeared, and that he lied about dropping her off after picking her up from campus, when "he knew full well that he did not drop" her off, but rather, "took her back to his apartment.". The complaint also states that Christensen used a Motorola cell phone and a Saturn Astra car in order to commit his crimes. Investigators searched Christensen's phone and discovered an April 19 visit to the website FetLife -- where the user visited a forum called "Abduction 101," with threads called "Perfect abduction fantasy" and "planning a kidnapping," authorities have said. Investigators sought search warrants and started their surveillance of Christensen on June 16, days after Zhang disappeared. Christensen will be arraigned under the charges from the updated indictment on October 11, according to Paul. A preliminary trial date has been set for February 27, according to the statement from the US attorney's office. CNN's Jen Goelz and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

V A novel patch that delivers polio vaccines may be more effective than oral doses or syringes, a study has found. (Photo: AFP). A novel patch that delivers polio vaccines may be more effective than oral doses or syringes, a study has found. The microscopic vaccine delivery platform called Nanopatch is a significant step forward in the efforts to rid the world of polio, researchers said. "Polio was one of the most dreaded childhood diseases of the 20th century, resulting in limb disfigurement and irreversible paralysis in tens of millions of cases," said Paul Young, professor at University of Queensland (UQ) in Australia. "This most recent study showed the Nanopatch enhanced responses to all three types of inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) - a necessary advancement from using the current live oral vaccine," said Young. Patch inventor Professor Mark Kendall said the study exhibited a key advantage of the Nanopatch. "It targets the abundant immune cell populations in the skins outer layers, rather than muscle, resulting in a more efficient vaccine delivery system," Kendall said. "The ease of administration, coupled with dose reduction observed in this study suggests that the Nanopatch could facilitate inexpensive vaccination of inactivated poliovirus vaccines," he said. "A simple, easy-to-administer polio Nanopatch vaccine could increase the availability of the IPV vaccine and facilitate its administration in door-to-door and mass vaccination campaigns," said David Muller researcher at UQ. "As recently as 1988, more than 350,000 cases occurred every year in more than 125 endemic countries," said Muller. "Concerted efforts to eradicate the disease have reduced incidence by more than 99 per cent," he said. .

VThe Uday Kotak-led committee on corporate governance's proposal to put in place a common 'stewardship code\u2019 might compel Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and top mutual funds (MFs) to play a more active role in this regard. . At present, there is no specific provision for such a code under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations. For MFs, some stewardship principles have been adopted, such as on voting and conflict of interest. In March, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) issued a stewardship code for companies in its ambit. Related Stories .  Widgets Magazine  . \u201cOver the years, disclosure on the voting patterns of MFs have gradually improved and insurance companies are now likely to come under increasing pressure to start voting on shareholder resolutions," says Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, an advisory entity on corporate governance. \u201cThe (proposed) code will make it a formal mandate for institutional investors to play a stewardship role, rather than remain silent spectators with respect to the affairs of their investee companies," says Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at consultancy KPMG India. Source: Sebi committee\u2019s report on corporate governance 2017. Sebi has been pushing MFs to vote on shareholder resolutions since 2010 \u2014 from having a voting policy to disclosing their voting rationale. In the process, MFs\u2019 abstention from voting on shareholder resolutions was down to 10 per cent in 2016 from earlier levels of over 80 per cent, says proxy advisory IiAS. While laws have empowered minority shareholders on a number of counts, such rights have not been effectively put to use by them, barring some instances where their influence has been evident, say experts. \u201cInsurers have been inconsistent in voting on shareholder resolutions. While some are proactive and have been voting, others have waited for a regulatory push," observes a recent report from IiAS. According to Subramanian, minority shareholders can use regulations such as the new Bankruptcy Code or provisions in the Companies Act to raise concern on financial wrongdoing. However, the objectives can only be achieved if institutional investors such as MFs and insurance companies lend support, he said. In 2014, for instance, seven fund houses had got together to oppose Maruti Suzuki\u2019s proposed deal to transfer an upcoming Gujarat factory to parent Suzuki Motor Corp of Japan. There could be practical difficulties in implementing a stewardship code. First, MFs manage liquid assets for several companies, in hundreds of crore. \u201cFund houses will think twice before going against the management of these companies \u2014 the latter might withdraw the amounts parked in these funds. Second, many MFs and insurance companies are themselves owned by large corporates," observes Subramanian. A stewardship code will help institutional investors to engage constructively with companies on matters ranging from strategy, governance and performance to risk management. \u201cThe form of engagement could vary from periodic meetings with the company management to taking normal board positions, where possible, and also through voting at shareholder meetings. Once institutional shareholders take on an active role, the benefits will percolate to retail (small) shareholders," said Venkateshwaran. According to IiAS, an engagement mechanism \u2014 one that entails connecting with the management of investee companies with regard to strategy and performance, as well as environmental, social and governance issues \u2014 is less tangible than voting on shareholder resolutions. \u201cThe outcomes of these discussions are not easily quantifiable and the success of these efforts might be less measurable. However, engagement efforts have yielded results in the past," goes its report.

VBeing cooped up inside one of the cars racing in Australia's biannual World Solar Challenge from Darwin to Adelaide looks like the most uncomfortable experience ever for those behind the wheel. You can imagine the drivers having to be lifted out of the vehicle by a small crane once they cross the finish line, their limbs having seized up somewhere south of Uluru. Aimed at inspiring research and development work in sustainable road transport, the 30th anniversary of the 1,860-mile race kicked off on Sunday with 42 solar-panel-laden cars from 40 countries hitting the road across three classes of vehicle. The Challenger category tends to get the most attention thanks to the cars' often striking designs that allow them to reach speeds of just over 60 mph using only the power of the sun. Lined up and ready for action, the first out of #Darwin get ready to roll. #BWSC17 pic.twitter.com/LSL3UbAEQs. \u2014 World SolarChallenge (@WorldSolarChlg) ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2017. This year the race organizers decided to make things a little tougher for the designers and engineers who create the cars by decreasing the permitted size of the solar collector area on each vehicle. The favorite to reach the finish line first is Nuna9 from the Dutch Nuon Solar Team, which is aiming for its eighth World Solar Challenge win. The team says it has tweaked Nuna9's design for this year's event by removing its overhanging nose to reduce aerodynamic drag. "With our successes in previous years, every year is harder to get a great result," the team said. "This means our students have to become more innovative every year.". We told you these cars can seriously move - @uitm_EcoSprint sitting on 90 clicks coming out of Darwin #BASC17 pic.twitter.com/LsaUuDQMDF. \u2014 World SolarChallenge (@WorldSolarChlg) ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2017. U.S. participation includes the Sundae solar car from Stanford University. The team said its design aims for "reliability and safety ... rather than focusing primarily on speed, paying special attention to car handling when possible," adding that the race is "a unique opportunity to exercise our car in the most intense way possible, truly proving its mettle and testing our team at the same time.". Racers in the Challenger class will be out to beat the fastest time to date, set by a Japanese team from Tokai University, which crossed the line with a driving time of 29 hours and 49 minutes in 2009. Besides the Challenger class, the Cruiser category focuses more on practical designs that you might actually want to ride in for more than a few minutes, and includes at least two seats. The Adventure class, meanwhile, comprises cars from previous races and could include those that don't quite meet the requirements for the other two categories. The vehicles, which make several stops along the route through Australia's barren outback, are expected to cross the finish line in Adelaide on Thursday, October 12.

If your car has leather upholstery, it\u2019s important to determine what kind of leather it is so you can buy the correct cleaning product. The information should be readily available but if you can\u2019t find it on your car\u2019s manual or the manufacturer\u2019s website, do a simple test. Put a drop of water on the leather seat. If the water gets absorbed quickly, it\u2019s aniline leather. If it takes quite some time before the water is absorbed, it\u2019s semi-aniline leather. If the water gets repelled, you most likely have corrected grain or full-grain leather. 3. Do have the car seats cleaned once a month. . Dirt can easily get stuck in the fibers of the car seat and on the surface of leather seats. The dirt particles can become abrasive and can cause the upholstery to look faded quickly. Having the car seats cleaned once a month it one way of ensuring that your car\u2019s upholstery will remain looking like new for a long time. 4. Don\u2019t forget to get professional car detailing once every 2-3 months. . It\u2019s advisable to get car detailing in North Vancouver every 2-3 months. Having this done professionally by body shops such as Elite Body Shop can help keep your car\u2019s interior in great condition. 5. Do keep the leather parts of your car conditioned. . Make sure the conditioner is bereft of things like silicone and petroleum. It should contain only natural oils to avoid having that unwanted greasy surface on the leather seats. . These are the things you can do to ensure that your car\u2019s interior will look new all the time. Nothing beats getting in a car that is clean and is devoid of unwanted smell. .

VKarma Yatri Travel and Art (KYTA), a residency programme, aims to explore and work on the possible relationships between travel, living, culture, art and expression by bringing together artists from different fields. About KYTA. At KYTA\u2019s residency programme, practising artists of different specialisations come from around the world to collaborate towards a single work of art. The artists for the programme are identified by KYTA through recommendations, mostly from the past residents. The project is completed during the period of the residency; the theme and framework for their project is decided by the artists in unison. KYTA was started by Shazeb Shaikh (33) and Hashim Qayoom (37) in 2014. \u201cThe idea is to see how different disciplines can work together to create something of value,\u201d says Shazeb, who works with a 35-member-strong advertising agency called Sparkt in Mumbai. Shazeb has been making films and dabbling with a creative career since he was 21. Hashim is also the founder of Karma Yatri, an experimental travel company that organises bike expeditions across India. Hashim had travelled to Kalga, a small village in Himachal Pradesh, often. The beauty of this Himalayan village, the simple and traditional lifestyle of its people, made him imagine it as the place which could inspire the creation of a collaborative artwork. That\u2019s how KYTA was born in 2014, six months after it was conceptualised. While artists work together on a single project, the programme also gives them the opportunity to conduct workshops, wherein they can share with other artists their experiences and learnings. Kalga-5 (2014-2018) is the current residency programme to which KYTA is committed for five years. At the end of Kalga-5, the team will hand over the project to the Kalga village, having made an attempt to bring out a unique perspective of Kalga in the finished artwork. An experimental programme. Initially, the founders of KYTA wanted to hold the residency in different locations each year of the programme. This perception changed as they discovered how the pristine beauty of Kalga inspired artistic creation. Due to the experimental nature of this project, KYTA\u2019s vision has changed since 2016. \u201cWe changed our project\u2019s focus from the residency to the village. This meant that the artwork produced in the village would stay in the village, the inspiration for which could come from outside or within the village,\u201d says Shazeb. This year, for the first time, all the artwork will be exhibited in Kalga itself. A peculiar feature of Kalga is that it does not have a community that the artists can engage with. The village contains within itself a total number of 35 houses, out of which only three to four houses are occupied throughout the year. The unoccupied houses are converted into homestays. \u201cThis makes it easier for us to approach the residents and tell them about what we do and install our artwork in some of these houses,\u201d says Shazeb. In 2016, KYTA set up Karma Studio in Kalga in collaboration with Studio Karva of Mumbai. This studio acts as a basic facility where potters and sculptors, local or from outside, can work. The clay used for these activities is mined out from the vicinity. A sound and music studio for producing and listening to music is in the process of being set up. They also envision setting up a library for which books will be sourced from all over the world. \u201cPeople will be asked to donate books from any field, so long as they are unique in nature,\u201d says Shazeb. The present and past editions. In 2014, 10 artists worked on a short experimental film called, aLpha. In 2015, 11 artists attended the residency as part of a bilateral exchange between France and India. They made a feature-length film from scratch within six weeks. None of these artists had previous knowledge of filmmaking. The film, Inedie, was released in 2017. KYTA gets its funding from the Swiss Arts Council and Karma Yatri. They have recently initiated a crowd funding campaign, keeping expenditure for future editions in mind. The current edition is a tripartite gathering of Swiss, South Korean and Indian artists, featuring 17 artists from different fields of focus. This year, the artists come from a plethora of backgrounds such as architecture, dance, social practice, land art, painting, material research, installation art, and writing. One of the highlights of this year\u2019s programme is the collaborative effort of an Indian and a Swiss artist in the form of a dance performance. In 2018, this performance will be a part of an Indo-Swiss dance project that will be launched in the Northeast of India. All the artwork produced during a given residency is archived in the form of the Kalga Art Collection. Paintings are the most common form of physical archives of KYTA; other art forms are archived electronically. Calling all woman-founded startups in Pune! Facebook and YourStory are organising a mixer focused on helping women entrepreneurs scale their startups with mentorship and marketing tools from Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme.

VIsha Arogya\u2019s comprehensive approach to health represents a paradigm shift in healthcare. Its focus is not just on combating disease, but on creating a sense of wholeness in the individual. This approach enables people to cultivate their body, \u201cMind\u201d and energies in such a way that health is a natural way of being. While Allopathy (modern medicine) is recognized for its ability to quickly cure infectious diseases, the traditional systems of medicine, Siddha and Ayurveda, are also included for their ability to strengthen the human body\u2019s innate ability to resist disease, so that the question of chronic disease simply does not arise. In addition to its holistic therapies for specific ailments, Isha Arogya also offers massages, nutritional supplements, naturopathy, yoga programs and rejuvenating therapies to bring an individual\u2019s system into balance and harmony. Isha Arogya\u2019s outreach includes clinics around Tamil Nadu that offer complete healthcare with free consultation, pharmacies, laboratories and therapy rooms. There are also plans to build a hospital able to offer a holistic approach to healthcare, based on Isha Arogya\u2019s concepts. The hospital will offer 24-hour medical service with in-patient facility, emergency and trauma care, operation theaters and a maternity center. It will include specially-designed affordable packages for the treatment of chronic diseases and rejuvenating programs for complete health and inner balance.

VKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 5th October 2017. (CNN) \u2014 The glamping trend has swept through Asia, with new luxury tented camps setting up in the region's most pristine locations. The latest additions include the soon-to-open Cardamom Tented Camp and Bill Bensley-designed Shinta Mani Wild, both in southwest Cambodia, and Rosewood Luang Prabang in the jungles of Laos. Better yet, many of Asia's hottest spots provide glimpses of elephants, gibbons and leopards through safari-style excursions. "It is different than an African safari," John Roberts, director of elephants at the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, tells CNN Travel. . "The nature of the forests and wildlife allow you to be much more intimate. Even in deepest tiger, leopard, rhino, sloth and bear territory -- with a good guide, you can safely walk and spend time concentrating on birds, butterflies and plant life between encounters with large mammals.". Looking for adventure that doesn't sacrifice comfort? Here are the top luxury tent experiences in the Asia region. Cardamom Tented Camp. Wildlife is slowly returning to the national parks around the Cardamon Tented Camp. A collaborative project from YAANA Ventures sustainable travel group, Cambodia's Wildlife Alliance conservation organization and Thailand-based Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, the Cardamom Tented Camp sits on a protected stretch of land that was once a hotbed of logging and poaching. Accessible only by boat, the camp's nine luxury tents overlook the Preak Tachan river and nearby grasslands in a stretch of land in southwest Cambodia, between Botum Sakor National Park and the Southern Cardamom National Park. . "The wildlife is slowly coming back after decades of unhindered poaching," says Roberts, who is the group director of sustainability and conservation at the camp, an initiative of Bangkok-headquartered Minor Group. "We have Asiatic wild dogs, clouded leopards, mouse deer, sun bears, hog badgers, gibbons, macaques, elephants and more.". The tented experience is complemented by a riverside restaurant, a floating pier and a slew of safari-style outings -- led by Wildlife Alliance rangers -- where travelers are bound to spot a mix of wildlife. "It's important to pick camps and lodges that actively preserve the forest," says Roberts. . "They will tend to have the best guides who are often either local community ex-poachers or research scientists -- or a combination of both." . The camp is due to open November 1. . Shinta Mani Wild -- The Bensley Collection . A new project from acclaimed resort designer Bill Bensley -- in partnership with Wildlife Alliance, Fauna & Flora International, The Royal University of Phnom Penh and the Cambodian government -- Shinta Mani Wild aims to be an unparalleled wildlife sanctuary. Hugged by three national parks -- Kirirom, Bokor and Cardamom -- in southwest Cambodia, the 15 tents promise an immersive experience with nature. A typical day could include multiple adventures, from river expeditions on what's said to be Southeast Asia's last wild estuarine system, to trekking through the forests where travelers can spot wild elephants, gibbons and bears. To spot animal migrations, the best time to visit is the dry season -- from November to March. Better yet, the beautifully designed tents incorporate elements of Cambodian architecture together with retro motifs that recall the days of colonial expeditions. When open in mid-2018, the resort will feature a restaurant and bar perched next to a waterfall serving locally sourced food, a spa and also highlight conservation projects from The Shinta Mani Foundation. Rosewood Luang Prabang. Also scheduled to open in early 2018, Rosewood Luang Prabang will sit about 10 minutes outside of Luang Prabang -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- in Laos. It's glamping 2.0 -- picture a dense jungle, waterfalls, open-air showers, private dining decks and a mix of 23 palatial villas and luxury tents nestled in an untouched natural environment. In addition to the stylish accommodation, Rosewood also has a Laotian bistro, bar and Rosewood Spa in the works. Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle. CNN Travel's Elite Escapes visits the Four Season's luxury tent complex in Thailand's Chiang Rai province. Claw-foot tubs, antique furniture, open-air showers, massive decks -- the all-inclusive Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle transports travelers to the early days of exploration thanks to the handiwork of resort designer Bill Bensley. there are 15 tents scattered amidst the jungle, plus one massive Explorer's Lodge with two separate bedrooms and a private plunge pool. The setting of the Golden Triangle -- where northern Thailand, Myanmar and Laos intersect -- combines dense jungles, grasslands, rivers and a camp for rescued elephants. The elephants make appearances around the tented camp in the mornings for bathing times with mahouts (elephant trainers) and can be seen wandering around through the vast sanctuary. Elsewhere on the grounds, travelers will find a bar with excellent sunset views, an open-air Thai restaurant, a wine cellar (where you can enjoy private tastings before dinner), cooking classes and a spa that seems to float in the middle of the jungle. Amanwana. Not many wild camps have views like this. Claiming its own private island and marine reserve in eastern Indonesia, Amanwana takes camping to the next level. Located on Moyo Island, the property's 20 "tented suites" have been kitted out with high ceilings, air-conditioning, hardwood floors, king-sized beds and large windows. The two types -- one surrounded by jungle, others beachfront -- are within easy walking distance of the coastline, where snorkeling and scuba diving will reward travelers with colorful reef life. On the grounds, there's also an open-air restaurant and the Jungle Cove Spa -- a chance to unwind in the company of macaque monkeys and tamarind trees. Those in search of more animal interactions will find loads of wildlife on jungle treks around the island. That is, if it doesn't find you first: Many types of fauna, including deer, are said to make appearances around the tents in the early mornings. Sandat Glamping Tents. Hidden away in the jungles and rice paddies surrounding Ubud, central Bali, Sandat Glamping Tents offers five luxury tents and three lumbung -- essentially thatched roof bungalows inspired by traditional Bali barns. . The whimsical accommodations marry elements of Balinese culture with romantic accents imported from Italy -- where the brand introduced its first glamping experience near Venice, in 2009. While each room has its own unique characteristics, many feature billowing drapes, Venetian-style chandeliers, four-poster beds and private pools. After a day of exploring the temples, biking through rice paddies or river rafting, there's a lounge and bar, a cathedral-like bamboo restaurant, or even a private dinner served under the stars. And if you're here for a wellness retreat, good news: One of the prettiest parts of the property is the yoga pavilion -- a gorgeous bamboo structure encircled by rice paddies. Elephant Hills. Thailand's Elephant Hills Rainforest Camp. One of Thailand's first luxury tented camps, Elephant Hills brings the tropical jungle right to your doorstep. The company has two distinct camps -- both inside Khao Sok National Park, in southern Thailand -- that offer differing experiences. As the name suggests, The Elephant Camp promises interactions with these gentle giants, many of which have been retired from the logging industry. Visitors can admire the elephants in their natural habitat, as well as bathe and feed them at select times during the day. Meanwhile, the Rainforest Camp floats along Cheow Lan Lake, where canoes and trekking adventures are close at hand. But the best part might be the tranquility. Travelers open their tent flaps and are just a few feet from the still lake -- a peaceful way to start the morning. To visit both glamping spots, travelers can opt for a Jungle Lake Safari, which includes a night at the Elephant Camp and two nights on the lake. Damodra Desert Camp. Offering a totally different type of safari, Damodra Desert Camp, in northern India, showcases the beauty of the desert. Here, travelers can experience the vast, windswept dunes of the Thar Desert -- about 18 miles outside of Jaisalmer, in Rajasthan -- without sacrificing any creature comforts. The Swiss cottage-inspired tents include air-conditioning, private patios, and colorful upholstery that pays tribute to the area. During the day, visitors will most likely partake in a camel safari or enjoy a sandboarding session on the dunes. Come nightfall, the camp comes alive with live music and Indian dinners -- all under the starlit desert sky. Norden Travel. Each of Norden Travel's tents is slightly different. Owned and operated by a local Tibetan couple, Norden Travel -- in China's central Gannan region -- the camp showcases the beautiful pastures and rich culture with eight pinewood cabins and four luxury yak-hair tents. The rustic decor and hardwood floors feels at once sophisticated and cozy -- the kind of place you could hole up for a while and clear your mind. Each tent and cabin is slightly different -- some nestled in the brush while others alongside the river -- but all have outdoor seating areas, stoves, and peaceful, pastoral views. While it's not quite a safari, a trek around the surrounding mountains and hills will likely reward guests with sightings of gazelle and pheasants, yaks and of course sheep. In addition, the camp also organizes horseback riding, village visits, guided hikes, yoga and private tours of Labrang Monastery, one of the six major Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. SUJÁN JAWAI and Sher Bagh Relais & Chateaux. A rustic retreat in Rajasthan, SUJÁN JAWAI provides 10 white canvas tents and all the modern amenities you could hope for, including an on-site spa, restaurant, swimming pool, yoga and more. Dotting the sandy Aravalli hills -- a three-hour drive from either Jodhpur or Udaipur in northern India -- the camp takes inspiration from its rugged surrounds, using leopard motifs, wildlife photography, and lots of bright red accents throughout. With their luxury tent as a home base, travelers can be as lazy or as adventurous as they please. The options include private bush picnics, sunset game drives, afternoon tea, evening cocktails and leisurely campfire dinners. There's also a half-day excursion to the incredible carved Ranakpur Jain Temple and the 15th-century fort Kumbhalgarh -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Even just wandering around the property -- which is actively involved in big cat conservation -- there's no shortage of flora and fauna to admire. Of course, the best experience will be with guides in town. On a Jeep-led safari, the camp's experts will lead travelers across grasslands, granite hills and lakes for the best views of leopards, antelopes, crocodiles, boars and flamingos. SUJÁN JAWAI's sister property, Sher Bagh, transports travelers to 1920s-style safaris within India's Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve. . By day, enjoy safaris and excursions and British-Raj style lunches; by night, settle into a tiger-themed pad. Tiger Tops. A twin-bed safari tent at Nepal's Tiger Tops site. A pioneer of sustainable tourism in Nepal, Tiger Tops was one of the first companies to set up a tented camp in Chitwan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site in south-central Nepal. "Perhaps because I spent so much time there, some of my most memorable (safari) experiences were in Chitwan," recalls Roberts. "From the breakfast golghar (a thatched, central building) at the old Tiger Tops Tented Camp, I watched rhinos mating, as well as a mother tiger and her four cubs.". In 2012, government policies required all hotels and lodges to move outside of the national park. Today, the company operates three locations across the country -- including recently opened Tiger Tops Elephant Camp, with comfortable tented accommodations. . The British-Nepali company provides elephants a chain-free refuge in their natural territory, where travelers can interact and observe the pachyderms' daily routine. Typical activities include cutting grass with the mahouts (elephant caretakers) to feed the animals or taking a jungle trek side by side.

VCrabbe scored 14 points on a minutes restriction and on a recovering sprained ankle. Both he and Kenny Atkinson agree: the fit is perfect. BROOKLYN, N.Y. \u2014 Five-and-a-half minutes into the Nets\u2019 117-83 win over the New York Knicks on Sunday, Allen Crabbe made his debut in Brooklyn black and white. It was almost 15 months after the start date he and Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson envisioned, but the ex-Trail Blazer played as if he\u2019d been waiting for this moment for a lifetime. Crabbe scored 14 points on five-of-seven shooting against the Knicks, but 11 of those 14 came off the bench in the first quarter. He probably would have gone for gold if he wasn\u2019t on a minutes restriction after recovering from a sprained ankle. Crabbe\u2019s performance was a reminder that Brooklyn \u2014 a team that jacked up the third-most three-pointers at one of the league\u2019s worst percentages last season \u2014 successfully addressed one of its glaring needs on the wing this summer. It was also a note that in Atkinson\u2019s pace-and-space system, the 25-year-old wing may be exactly what Brooklyn needs to jumpstart its offense. \u201cJust watching the first two preseason games, watching all the shots and watching how the offense flows, it\u2019s a perfect system,\u201d Crabbe said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feel here. When the coaches are telling you to do more, to shoot more. It\u2019s like the ultimate green light. So I\u2019m out there just playing basketball freely.\u201d. Added Atkinson: \u201cWe often talk about system fit. So we targeted Allen and said this is a guy who would fit in our system. Tonight is a good start. It was exactly kind of what we thought. Hopefully he can continue that as he gets healthier into the regular season.\u201d. It wasn\u2019t that long ago Allen Crabbe\u2019s Nets career was put on hold . Crabbe entered restricted free agency last summer as a coveted two-way wing who averaged 10 points on 39 percent three-point shooting with Portland in the 2015-16 season. Atkinson and Nets GM Sean Marks identified him as a perfect fit for their system and culture, so they lobbed a massive four-year, $75 million offer sheet his way. He signed it, and the Trail Blazers matched the offer, which was front-loaded and included a 15 percent trade kicker. . Crabbe spent one more season in Portland and morphed into the second-most efficient three-point shooter behind Kyle Korver, averaging 10.7 points on 44.4 percent shooting from downtown. But despite his relative success last year, Portland had $110 million in guaranteed contracts with young star Jusuf Nurkic\u2019s contract extension nearing next summer. So instead of eating a hefty luxury tax bill, the Trail Blazers dealt Crabbe to the Nets for Andrew Nicholson, whose contract they waived shortly after. Now, Crabbe and the Nets could be a perfect match. Prior to tip-off, Atkinson said he was excited to see Crabbe suit up because he is a low-usage, high-efficiency player, who competes on defense and doesn\u2019t need the ball to be effective. . In case you didn\u2019t know, those are the best types of players to have on your team. But the Trail Blazers may not have thought so, and if they did, they weren\u2019t willing to bite the financial bullet needed to keep him around. Brooklyn was \u2014 they offered him the deal in the first place \u2014 and now, Crabbe says it\u2019s his time to shine. \u201cIt\u2019s a different outlook that they have on me here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want me to do more, it\u2019s a bigger role here. So I\u2019m for the challenge. This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for, so I\u2019m gonna make things happen.\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s only the preseason. And yes, anything done against the Knicks\u2019 defense should be taken with 1/100 of a grain of salt. But Crabbe\u2019s hot shooting and active hands made the Barclays Center erupt in the first quarter. . .@allencrabbe was COOKING in his Nets debut! #WeGoHard pic.twitter.com/vR5gAfcDwT. \u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) October 9, 2017 .

Crabbe wasn\u2019t fazed at all by his performance Sunday night. Was Brooklyn\u2019s head coach?. \u201cIt\u2019s what I expected,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good all-around basketball player.\u201d.

VHow do you know stocks are a little overextended? A good indicator is when even the most bullish sellside analyst on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson, whose year-end price target of 2,700 is the highest of all his peers, warns that stocks may see "pullback or consolidation" and that the coming earnings season may be a "sell the news event.". Looking at the recent surge in the S&P, Wilson writes that broad stock index had gotten ahead of itself, reaching the low end of the bank's short term target (2550-75) for the index prior to earnings beginning (it hit 2,552 earlier this morning). He attributed this rush to buy stocks on the "too low" consensus forecast for Q3 EPS: . The consensus bottom-up forecast for 3Q S&P 500 is just 2.6% and appears too low. A strong 1H and a reluctance of corporates to raise guidance meant that mechanically 2H numbers needed to drift lower. With continued strength in economic growth and momentum in our proprietary leading earnings indicator we think companies will once again deliver versus consensus expectations. Look for continued contribution to overall earnings growth from Tech, Energy, and Financials (ex-Insurance). Accounting changes may also bring forward some earnings recognition, further supporting earnings growth. While the market will be focused on earnings over the next few weeks, bigger picture, NTM EPS estimates continue to rise, which should be a bigger driver of the market's direction. Looking past calendar year 2017, Wilson underscores the departure observed previously in that twelve month forward earnings have continued their upward trend, instead of being dragged sharply lower, "so the upward trend in NTM EPS is an important factor to consider when thinking about the primary direction of the market." Indeed, 2017 and 2018 so far appear different from the past three years, which saw zero EPS growth and the only upside in the S&P was due to multiple expansion, i.e., central bank liquidity. This time may be different... unless of course there is a sharp economic decline, which would lead to - you guessed it - an earnings drop. As a result, Wilson believes that "stocks correctly recognized this low bar a few weeks ago and rallied sharply into earnings season--a familiar pattern this year". They also rallied a little too far, and so Wilson says the he "would expect to see a pull back or consolidation as earnings are actually reported--i.e. a sell the news event." But don't worry: the next move is the "next surge" in the S&P "toward the bank's 1Q 2018 target of 2700". But before that, there are several downside risks stocks have to get over. First, is the potential impact of recent hurricanes on insurers (& financials), which as Goldman noted yesterday, will be a source of Y/Y Earnings decline this quarter: . Here's Morgan Stanley:. Financials has been a source of strength for earnings growth all year long, but for 3Q the sector actually has a negative contribution to overall market earnings growth. Fundamentals trends did not change on a dime. Rather, cat losses for P&C insurance firms related to the hurricanes are a major drag on the sector. Ex-Insurance, Financials are contributing 40+ bps to the earnings growth rate. Growth looks strongest among the banks as cost cutting continues and the rate environment is more supportive. With Insurance, Financials takes ~140 bps off of 3Q y/y EPS growth. This story has not fully played out yet. Our P&C Insurance Analyst, Kai Pan, has noted that not all companies have yet announced loss estimates, sell side analysts may not have yet adusted numbers, and there are substantial uncertainties around any estimates embedded in numbers that have been updated. On a forward looking basis though, major cat losses tend to position insurers well to pass along rate increases, which can be a tail wind for some in the sector assuming normalization of the forward cat losses. Another potential concerns is what happens after Q4, when comps get harder and the bar to beat jumps substantially higher, however two things could make such comps attainable: a continued USD weakness, and passage of the Trump tax reform which would cut corporate taxes:. Expectations for 4Q and beyond start to look harder to achieve given they are all for double digit growth rates and will be lapping harder comps (Exhibit 8). For example, 4Q17, currently projected around 11%, is lapping a ~4% growth comp in 4Q16. In addition to underlying economic growth, two additional forces can help make these numbers more achievable: the USD and tax reform. . With respect to the USD, the currency did not really have its rapid appreciation until the last quarter of 2016. This means that 4Q17 is where we start comping against the stronger USD. The DXY is down just over 2% on a y/y base but over 8% from the end of the year. The DXY could rise a bit into year end and still be down several percent y/y. We addressed this in July noting that 1) y/y weakness in the DXY tends to correlate with revenue growth and earnings revisions breadth and 2) that our quantitative equity research colleagues estimated that every 1 percent fall y/y in the dollar equates to roughly ½ percentage point of additional forward EPS growth. . A lower corporate tax rate, which is still our base case, will be a boost for earnings. We have estimated that a 25% corporate tax rate would help lift 2018 earnings by about 6%. Increased investment and late cycle activity as a result of tax reform could also help lift organic growth. . If USD and a lower tax rate alone can help add a mid-single digit contribution to earnings growth, it is not unreasonable to think that next year's higher targets are achievable. Finally, Wilson writes that one additional final factor that may drag equities lower in the near-term, one which Warren Buffett suggested a week or so ago, is tax Loss Selling. . As we head into 4Q, tax loss selling becomes a possible source of technical pressure on some stocks. We screen the S&P 1500 for tax loss selling candidates, looking for stocks that may have been well-liked to start the year and that have seen substantial price declines. Our screening methodology has produced a -2.3% average and -1.6% median return in calendar 4Q over the last 15 years and appears to yield further underperformance than just a screen of stocks with similar price declines. This year, the screen produces a list of 62 stocks. The screen of stocks most likely to see tax-loss related selling according to MS is shown below.

VKolkata, Oct 9 (PTI) The West Bengal government has decided to preserve some of the Durga idols with "exquisite" artwork in different puja pandals in the city this year. Along with the state government, some private organisations would also safeguard such idols. "Many of the idols created for this year's Durga Puja are works of exquisite art and worthy of preservation. So we have decided to preserve some of them. And there area a few organisations as well as some individuals who have come forward to preserve them in their private collections," a senior state government official said. The state government has decided to permanently preserve Chetla Agrani's Durga idol carved out of mahogany wood by artist Bhabatosh Sutar at the Eco Park, he said. "We have been preserving the best Durga Puja idols at Eco Park for the last few years. This year we will keep the idol of Chetla Agrani," he said. Sutar will himself preserve the six feet-tall terracotta idol of Baidyabagan Nabapally at Singhi More in Amtala at the artistes' conclave, 'Chander Haat' in South 24 Parganas district's Sarsuna. "This is for the first time we are preserving any Durga idol at Chander Haat. We have selected an open space here with a shade above it," Sutar told PTI. The terracotta idol of Amtala was created in a traditional style by veteran artist Biswanath Kumbhakar of Panchmura in Bankura. The recently-refurbished 'Phire Dekha' gallery near Rabindra Sarovar Lake will also preserve four fibre glass idols. "The idols at Jagat Mukherjee Park, Shiv Mandir, Buroshibtala and Barisha Udayan Pally will be preserved at our gallery," an official in charge of supervising the gallery, said.

VRepresentative Image.  New Delhi: . The Delhi High Court today granted six-months time to the Centre to look into accounts of political parties, including the Congress and the BJP, for traces of foreign funds. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar gave the "last opportunity" to the Ministry of Home Affairs for compliance of its 2014 judgement, in which the high court had found both parties flouting the norms of the FCRA by accepting donations from Indian subsidiaries of UK-based Vedanta Resources. Section 4 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) prohibits a political party or legislature from accepting foreign contributors. On March 28, 2014, the high court had ordered the Election Commission and the Ministry of Home Affairs to look into the accounts of political parties and take action within six months. However, MHA represented by central government's standing counsel Monika Arora, sought extension of time till March 31, 2018 to comply with the court's directions. The Centre in its application said the records are voluminous in nature and are of few decades old, hence, to collect, collate and then analyse them requires more time.

V Trials and tribulations have the ability to make us realise our inner strength. As they say, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. .  Life dealt a heavy blow to Smilie Suri when her marriage with dancer Vineet Bangera hit a rocky patch. Adding to her emotional trauma and depression were health woes like PCOD and thyroid. However, rather than accepting defeat, the actress regained her grip on life with pole dance, and has now turned into a full-fledged trainer of the dance form. .  She says, "I was battling depression when I found pole dance, and it has brought me a lot of emotional stability. I don't feel the need for anyone to back me up anymore. Of course, I still have days when I cry myself to sleep, but all that it takes to wipe away my blues is one student sharing how confident and independent she feels after learning it." .  Smilie's tryst with pole dance began by chance, after her aerial dance class got cancelled one day. She recalls, "It made me feel sexy and empowered; my weight no longer bothered me. I liked it so much that I decided to pursue it professionally. I even underwent a seven-week training program in Singapore, in pole, chair and static pole dance. That experience changed me completely \u2014 it was like finding a parallel universe. Till then, I was mostly surrounded by boys (brother Mohit Suri and cousin Emraan Hashmi), but all my classmates there were girls. I found sisterhood, feminine energy and became a girl again." .  Pole dance is often looked down upon, as it is associated with strippers. Smilie clarifies, "Both Bollywood and Hollywood are responsible for stereotyping it. Pole dance involves a lot of balancing, hand and head stands. It was done by strippers, but it has become a sport now. The need of the hour is to practise it like a sport and get fit. And what's wrong with feeling sexy? Ours is the land of Kamasutra. In my academy, I teach Bolly pole as every girl likes dancing to Bollywood numbers. The idea came about after my sister-in-law (Udita Goswami) insisted that I teach her pole dance to a Bollywood number." .  Interestingly, Smilie's family too was averse to her learning it in the beginning. She reveals, "My family thought that I had gone cuckoo, but eventually, they came around. Mohit and Emraan told me to promote fitness through it and not pursue it as a dance \u2014 they probably must have been to bars and seen it (laughs). When I ran short of money and was starving in Singapore \u2014 I didn't eat for a couple of days as I was saving up to buy a competition-grade pole \u2014 Mohit sent me money. Emraan also supported me emotionally, whenever I had a breakdown after eight-hour-long training sessions. Now, I plan to start a pole-conditioning class for men. I will start with my brothers, Mohit, Emraan, Kunal Deshmukh and Aditya Dutt." .

V Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 9 - Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday hit back at BJP President Amit Shah, accusing him of spreading canards about the CPI-M and political violence in the state. .  Writing on his Facebook page, Vijayan pointed out that there was no space in Kerala for the kind of politics Shah preached -- built on caste, creed, hatred and money power.  After realizing that this agenda of his is not going to sell in Kerala, he started spreading canards and baseless lies. His feeling of dejection is understandable and that's the reason he is speaking like this, the CPI-M leader said.  Shah had on October 3 launched a blistering attack on Vijayan, holding him responsible for the killings of RSS and BJP activists in Kerala.  I pity the failed efforts of Shah, who is the President of a party that rules the country and who tried his best to impose the RSS agenda on Kerala and has failed, Vijayan said. .  He said it was most unfortunate that he led a march to the office of another national party (CPI-M). He called this nothing but a blatant violation of democratic principles.  On Monday, the Communist Party of India-Marxist protested against the Bharatiya Janata Party all across the country.  --IANS.  sg/mr .

VThe iPhone X was unveiled on September 12th to much fanfare. The marquee iPhone of 2017, the iPhone X will be launched on November 3rd in India will be priced at Rs 89000 for the 64GB variant. Although the launch is a month away, a video has surfaced online showing off the iPhone X in all its glory. The short clip doesn\u2019t show off anything particularly notable like animoji or the infamous FaceID fail but, it does give us a good look at the iPhoneX\u2019s edge-to-edge screen. You can watch the video here. The phone appears to be on AT&T\u2019s network and the Redditor who posted the video claims it was recorded in San Jose. If you don\u2019t know much about the American geography, San Jose isn\u2019t too far away from Apple\u2019s HQ in Cupertino. You may also like : Apple iPhone X Vs The Competition. In the video, you can see that the person holding the phone is rotating it in his hands showing off the front and back of the iPhone X. A shaking padlock appears to signal that FaceID is locking him out and someone else owns the device, most likely an Apple employee with early access to the iPhone X. Looks like FaceID is secure after all? A lot of commenters on the thread claim to have seen the iPhone X out and about in the Bay Area and it in\u2019t surprising that someone finally caught one on video. The iPhone X will go on sale on November 3rd in major countries including India and there are reports that the smartphone will be available in limited quantities up until 2018 due to manufacturing delays. Priced at Rs 89000 for the 64GB variant, the iPhone X is poised to be the most expensive iPhone in the Indian market when it launches.

VAre you looking forward to get pregnant and start a new family with your husband? If yes, then you need to take a few precautions to make sure that your pregnancy period goes well. There are various things that you might be doing currently and you need to stop those activities immediately. Things like alcohol, cigarettes, and tobacco are extremely toxic, and they can prove too poisonous for you and the foetus. If you have any such bad habits and trying to conceive, then read the following points to know more about the ill-effects of such habits. Quit Smoking Immediately. If you have been smoking cigarettes or tobacco in any other form, then stopping it before pregnancy is the most ideal thing to do. Smoking raises the chances for miscarriage, untimely birth and low-birth-weight. Furthermore, it also expands the likelihood of your child developing issues later on, such as asthma. If you think that you can\u2019t stop, in that case, at least make an attempt to reduce the quantity of cigarettes you smoke, and take additional care to eat well. Your gynecologist can give you helpful tips on the most effective method to stop or decrease smoking cigarettes. Even if you\u2019re not a smoker, keep in mind that long exposure to second-hand smoke is likewise unsafe. Important Note: Remember, it\u2019s important for you to find the most experienced gynec for your treatment, and for that you need to make a list of the best female gynecologists in Mumbai, and then get more information about them. Say No To Alcohol. Pregnant moms are strongly advised to stay away from any form of liquor. If you drink, the foetus becomes more exposed to risks such as infections, birth defects, infant mortality, and growth inadequacies. Infants born to women who frequently consume liquor may suffer from physical and intellectual damage, a health issue known as FAS (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome). Since it isn\u2019t known whether there is a safe least amount of liquor which can be consumed without involving any risk, it is better to stay away from liquor completely during your pregnancy period. By deciding not to consume alcohol while you\u2019re pregnant, you increase the infant\u2019s chances of having a healthy life. Use Medicines Cautiously. It\u2019s also crucial to practice caution when it comes to intake of medicines. Some generally utilised medications, including non recommended drugs as aspirin, and even other common medicines, have been connected to birth abnormalities. This is why it becomes so important to find the best gynec. With proper research, you\u2019ll surely find the best gynec in Mumbai, who can help you to conceive and cure all other infertility problems.

The girl was found by CISF who sweep the station at night after the train services are terminated. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT PHOTO). A 15-year-old girl, who got separated from her friend while travelling in the Delhi Metro, had to spend a night at a metro station as the Delhi Police could not take her custody because there was no woman constable. . A woman constable of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) turned saviour by feeding her dinner and keeping the girl under her watch on September 25 night at Pitampura Metro station. The incident took place when the train services had terminated. . \u201cWe conduct sweeping of stations after the train services are terminated. During the exercise, soon after midnight, the staff at Pitampura metro station saw a girl sitting alone at platform number 2. She was brought to the control room where she said that she was waiting for her male friend. We immediately called the police,\u201d said a CISF officer, who is not authorised to speak to the media. But the Delhi Police reportedly refused to take the custody as they did not have any woman officer at that time. According to rules, the presence of female staff is mandatory while taking the custody of a girl whether she is an accused or a victim. . \u201cThe Delhi Police requested us to keep the girl with a female constable of the CISF. We agreed and our constable was asked to sit in front of CCTV camera near the ladies frisking booth so that their movement can be monitored. In the morning, the girl was handed over to the police,\u201d CISF spokesperson Hemendra Singh said.  DCP (Metro) Pankaj Singh confirmed the incident and said that on that particular night, a female staff was not present at Rithala police station, under whose jurisdiction Pitampura Metro station is located. Singh said police took her custody the following morning and produced her before the Child Welfare Committee. The CWC\u2009sent her to a children\u2019s home till the next date of hearing.  . \u201cWe usually hand over the missing child to the family and if we are unable to find the family, we drop the child to the nearest shelter home,\u201d said a Delhi Police officer, who did not wish to be named. . With 28 lakh passengers travelling every day and 20% of them usually first timers, every day the CISF receives at least two cases of people getting separated from their relatives. While their main job is to secure the Metro premises, such cases are taken on priority basis as delay may affect the investigation. . Officer said that most of them get separated due to automatic doors and crowded Metro stations. Last year, over 100 kids were reunited with their parents. .  \u201cIn 2016, we reunited 106 children with their parents, while this year till June, 60 children have been reunited. Apart from this, over 100 adults have been reunited with their families from 2016 till date. We have trained our staff to identify people roaming alone. It is a misconception that only children are vulnerable. In Metro, many first timers from other states come and often get separated,\u201d the CISF official said. .

V  Boeing and Emirates  .  Dubai is a glistening metropolis of stupefying landmarks, golden dunes and world-famous shopping. . Dubai: it's big and brash, flashy and ostentatious. It's a super-car traffic jam on a big-city street. It's a $1000 bottle of champagne when a cheap sparkling would do. It's the biggest, the best and the most expensive of everything. At least, that's what people expect when they arrive in this Middle Eastern metropolis. Dubai is supposed to be small on culture, and big on bling. It's here for a good time, not a long time, and it doesn't mind telling you so. The food is good, and it's cheap. Dubai's architecture is impressive. Thanks to a large immigrant population, including a huge influx of people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and Jordan, Dubai has an incredibly good and affordable food scene. Simply wander the streets of Deira, one of the city's older and cheaper neighbourhoods, and you'll find tasty treats from around the world, available on the street for only a few dirhams. And for the best Pakistani food this side of Lahore, call past the suburb of Satwa to dine at the shabby-but-famous Ravi restaurant. It's also good, and expensive. Dubai at night, with view of Burj Khalifa. Dubai has a reputation for fine-dining excellence, and it certainly lives up to that, with plenty of celebrity chefs from around the world setting up outposts in hotels and resorts across the city. You'll have to lay down some serious coin to enjoy meals by the likes of Nobu Matsuhisa, Gordon Ramsay, Gary Rhodes, Jamie Oliver, Marco Pierre White and Sanjeev Kapoor, but it will be worth the expense. There aren't many locals. This takes a while to sink in for most first-time visitors: the fact that there don't seem to be any local Emiratis around at all. That's due to a few factors, most notably that only 11 per cent of Dubai's population is Emirati. The local culture, too, is quite a private one, meaning for many visitors the only Emirati they'll meet will be the one who stamps their passport at the airport. Those keen to learn more about local culture, however, should call in to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (cultures.ae). Shopping in the shouk is cheap. You can drink. A lot. Yes, there are laws against public inebriation, alcohol is extremely expensive, you have to be over 21 to drink it, and it's only served in bars attached to hotels or clubs. But that doesn't mean no one imbibes in Dubai. Any traveller expecting to have a dry holiday will be very surprised to find champagne brunches, happy hour drinks prices, and an expat culture of party-friendly boozing. The weekend begins on Friday \u2013 with brunch. Fine dinning: The Yuan Chinese restaurant at the Atlantis The Palm in Dubai. Why are the cafes and restaurants packed on a Friday morning, when everyone should be at work? This is the Islamic world, which means weekends are Fridays and Saturdays. Among the Dubai expat crowd, as well as many short-term visitors, the beginning of the weekend means one thing: brunch. And this is no light snack; Friday brunches are typically vast feasts as sumptuousness as they are boozy. Many hotels put on huge buffets of every food imaginable on which you can gorge yourself before lurching back to the hotel room for a snooze. There's history in Dubai. It's true: 50 years ago this heaving metropolis was little more than a creekside fishing village (before oil was discovered). But that doesn't mean there isn't history in Dubai. The oldest part of the city is al-Fahidi, a well-preserved cultural area that dates back to the early 1900s. The narrow alleyways and traditional homes here are a pleasant break from the skyscrapers and superhighways of Dubai proper. Holidaymakers visit a beach area on the waterfront outside the Jumeirah Beach hotel. The Burj Khalifa is incredible. Even if a the sight of really, really tall building doesn't sound that amazing to you, prepare to be stunned. The 829-metre Burj Khalifa (burjkhalifa.ae) is the tallest building in the world, and it really is difficult to take in just how stupendously big it is. The view from the observation deck, some 148 storeys above the ground, is mind-boggling. Nothing looks real from that height \u2013 it's like staring at a child's miniature of the world. Going to the top is not cheap (from $46), but it's worth every dirham. This is not a city for walking. An aerial view over Dubai's Palm Island, Dubai. Those who love to explore on foot will be sorely disappointed by Dubai. For starters, it's usually about a million degrees outside \u2013 you don't want to be trekking around in the sun. Plus most things in Dubai are miles apart, and the city has certainly not been designed with pedestrians in mind. About the only places you'll feel comfortable walking are the enormous shopping malls, which, in fairness, do provide plenty of room to stretch the legs. It's a shopper's paradise. Speaking of shopping malls, Dubai is a heaven on par with Hong Kong or Singapore for those who take pleasure in the purchasing of goods. You can buy just about anything here, from designer clothes to jewellery, spices, top-quality foodstuffs and souvenirs. At Dubai Mall (thedubaimall.com), there's even a "Gold to Go" ATM, at which you well-heeled shoppers can withdraw one-ounce bars of solid gold, provided they have the funds. Only in Dubai. A group of Emiratis walk past the Burj Dubai Tower, the tallest tower in the world. Dubai is not staggering merely in size and grandiosity alone \u2013 it's also a place of surprising architectural beauty. We're talking icons like the Burj Khalifa and the Burj Dubai (the sail-shaped luxury hotel), as well as the amazing Palm project featuring the Atlantis Hotel, the twisting Cayan Tower, and the JW Marriott Marquis, the world's tallest hotel. The desert is right there. It takes such a small amount of time \u2013 we're talking minutes here \u2013 to go from the skyscrapers and tarmac of Dubai to proper, endless desert. As soon as the city ends, the sand dunes begin. There are plenty of companies offering varying experiences out there in the wilderness, from 4WD safaris to Bedouin-style dinners to sand-boarding trips to quad-biking. It certainly makes a change from the shopping malls and fancy restaurants. Camel racing is big in Dubai. Given its proximity to the desert, it should come as little shock that Dubai gets hot \u2013 very, very hot. Average high temperatures in the summer months, June to August, range from 38 to 40 degrees. That's too hot to do anything outside except run to the next bit of air-conditioning. In winter, meanwhile, it's a mild 23 to 26 degrees during the day, making it ideal for wandering the streets or hitting the beach. The locals are rich \u2013 really, really rich. Your first brush with a local Emirati will probably be having your passport stamped at the airport. Your second brush with a local Emirati will probably be watching as one zooms past in a Range Rover or a Ferrari. Emirati tends to do quite well, financially \u2013 that much will certainly be clear if you ever find yourself driving past one of their extensive houses. Very few sit outside the 1 per cent. An Arabian Adventures four-wheel-drive does some "dune bashing" during a desert safari. There aren't many women around. This isn't a comment on culture, but on raw statistics. Dubai's population, thanks to a large influx of blue-collar migrant workers, is made up of about 69 per cent men. That means that by far the bulk of the people you'll see wandering around the place \u2013 unless you're in the foyer of your hotel \u2013 will be of the male persuasion. You can do pretty much anything. The view from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Feel like going skiing when it's 40 degrees outside? You can do that, at the indoor Ski Dubai (theplaymania.com). Feel like playing golf on a lush green course in the middle of the desert? You can do that as well, at several courses throughout the city. And if you feel like riding a camel, or going boating, or drinking French champagne, or seeing a concert, or going to an art gallery, or going stand-up paddle-boarding, or skydiving, or driving an F1 car, or swimming with dolphins, or going bungy-jumping\u2026 you can do that too. It's a place of high culture. Though the city might appear a little gaudy and gauche, there's plenty in Dubai for culture vultures. The recently opened Dubai Opera (dubaiopera.com) hosts regular concerts and events, while it's also possible to view contemporary Middle Eastern art at a number of galleries throughout town, or catch concerts by bands from around the world at places like Burj Park, The Music Hall, and The Music Room. Camel racing is insane. So much about one of Dubai's favourite sports is completely bonkers. For starters, there are no actual jockeys on these camels, but rather small robots that sit on top of the animals and are controlled by someone nearby. How is there someone constantly nearby, you ask? Easy \u2013 a flotilla of luxury, air-conditioned 4WDs follows the camels around while they're racing, allowing the passengers to control the robot. The camel-racing tracks are also so big that you'll barely be able to see the participants most of the time from your grandstand perch. But still, this is a proper experience. It's possible to travel on a budget. If you choose to stay in fancy resorts and eat out at the best restaurants and do your shopping in big malls, then a stay in Dubai will be very, very expensive. But it doesn't have to be that way. Spend time in the suburb of Deira, haggling at markets, eating Middle Eastern street food, staying in budget hotels and getting around on foot, and you'll suddenly find that this city can be extremely affordable. Everything seems like a world-record breaker. After a few days in Dubai you'll become so used to hearing that something is the biggest/fastest/most expensive/tallest/most beautiful in the world that those facts will cease to even register as being interesting. Dubai has many, many claims to world records for all sorts of things, including the world's tallest building and the world's largest shopping mall. Get used to hearing about it. It's not as conservative as you think. You've probably read the stories of foreigners being locked up in Dubai for public displays of affection, or being too drunk, or even being gay. And it's true, occasionally people do get caught out for activities that would be very much OK back home. But Dubai, on the whole, is not that conservative. You can wear whatever you feel comfortable in. You'll find expats and tourists from around the world drinking and canoodling in bars and clubs. And there's even a pretty healthy gay scene. Just be aware of cultural sensitivities, and you'll be fine.

V2014-2016 EcoDiesels will probably be recalled for new software code.  If you've been patiently waiting for 2017 Ram EcoDiesel trucks to hit dealerships near you, you're in luck. According to Automotive News, the diesel-powered pickups are now hitting showroom floors after FCA received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency in late July to begin producing them again. And you may want to get in line now, because the EPA has yet to approve the EcoDiesel for the 2018 model year.  The EPA, along with the California Air Resources Board, accused FCA in January of 2017 of using eight undeclared pieces of software code in certain Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles. That, naturally, led to "substantially" higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide emissions. The violation applies to about 104,000 vehicles sold between 2014 and 2016. EcoDiesel production was stopped in late 2016.  FCA says it's continuing to cooperate with the EPA and CARB. Assuming the two agencies approve the plan, the automaker will recall 2014-2016 Ram and Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles to install the new code. We'd assume that same updated software will be used in 2018 EcoDiesels, too, again assuming they get EPA approval.

VNew Delhi: Two days after seven military personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Tawang, purported images of their bodies wrapped in plastic sacks and tied up in cardboard surfaced today, trigerring an outrage. This prompted the Army to come out with a tweet saying the wrapping of the bodies with local resources was an abberation and that the fallen soldiers are always given full military honour. \u201cSeven young men stepped out into the sunshine yesterday to serve their motherland, India. This is how they came home,\u201d tweeted former Northern Army commander Lt Gen (Retd) HS Panag, along with the images of the bodies. Reacting to the issue, the Army\u2019s Additional Directorate General of Public Information tweeted that the carriage of the mortal remains in body bags, wooden boxes and coffins will be ensured. \u201cFallen soldiers (are) always given full military honour. Carriage of mortal remains in body bags, wooden boxes,coffins will be ensured,\u201d it said. It said wrapping the bodies in local resources was an aberration. The photographs were taken when the bodies were in Guwahati, as per an official. Lt Gen (Retd) Panag said proper military body bags must be used to transport bodies from forward locations until ceremonial coffins were available. Several people on twitter also expressed their anguish after the images surfaced. Five IAF personnel, including two pilots, and two armymen were killed when the Mi-17 V5 chopper crashed on Friday morning in Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh.

VPakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said the days of Islamabads dependence on Washington to meet its military requirements have ended. In an interview to Arab News, published on Monday, the Prime Minister said the world should recognise Pakistan's efforts in fighting the "world's war" on terror. "If one source dries up, we have no option but to go to another source. It may cost more, it may consume more resources, but we have to fight that war, and that's what we emphasised to all the people that we met.".  "We have major US weapons systems in our military, but we've also diversified (our arsenal). We have Chinese and European systems. Recently, for the first time we inducted Russian attack helicopters," Abbasi said. Responding to a question, the Prime Minister said that US' newly devised policy to include India for peace-building in Afghanistan will be detrimental for the region. "We don't believe that injecting India into the Pakistan-US relationship will help resolve anything, especially in Afghanistan, where we don't see any role for India. India has a relationship with the US, and that is between them and the US," Abbasi said. He added that Pakistan wants an "equal relationship or partnership with the US, like every other nation" and wants to work with Washington in resolving regional and global issues ranging from the "economy to nuclear matters". He said that in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly and side meetings, he stressed that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. "We're partners in the war on terror, and that's what we emphasised. We emphasised to everybody we met (at the UNGA) that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan". Abbasi said that in the recently held meeting between Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Asif told his counterpart that Islamabad pursues a zero-tolerance approach to "all terrorist and militant groups". He called his meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence, "very constructive". "There was no meeting scheduled (with President Trump). In fact, the meeting with Vice President Pence wasn't scheduled (either). It was at their request," the Prime Minister said.

VState-owned ONGC is likely to sell some of its stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC to part-fund it's over Rs 34,000-crore acquisition of refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) holds 13.77 per cent stake in India's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which at today's market price is worth over Rs 27,800 crore. It has another 4.87 per cent stake in GAIL India Ltd worth of Rs 1,600 crore. "The acquisition of 51.11 per cent government stake in HPCL will be funded through a combination of market borrowing and selling some stake in IOC and GAIL," a source privy to the development said. Selling stake in the open market may create volatility, and so, ONGC is considering selling less than 2 per cent stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC in the block deal, he added. 6 Precautions To Take When Investing In The Stock Market. ONGC May Sell IOC Stake To LIC In Block Deal. ONGC has already secured shareholder nod to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore debt, he said, adding that the company had about Rs 10,000 crore of cash in hand. "It will be a combination of stake sale and borrowing to fund the acquisition," the source said. The deal, he said, is likely to conclude by December. 6 Biggest Mistakes Stock Market Investors Makes. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC "along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC." But since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension that it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders, he said. So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that "HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas". This helped avoid making an open offer.

VNew Delhi: CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday hit out at the RSS-BJP, saying the Left party was capable of giving a suitable answer if the saffron outfits did not stop political violence. The CPI(M) today held a march till the BJP headquarters here to protest against the alleged saffron terror in Kerala and to counter the ongoing protest marches of the BJP against the alleged violence by the Left. Pic courtesy: Twitter/@SitaramYechury. "We will not keep quite. We warn the BJP that if they do not stop violence then we will answer back. We will not bow down," Yechury said.  The march was led by Yechury who was joined by former party general secretary Prakash Karat and other politburo members.  Addressing party cadres in front of the BJP headquarters, Yechury alleged that while the BJP was campaigning in Delhi against the "Left violence" in Kerala, it were continuing violence against the Left cadres.  Yechury referred to yesterday's incident in which RSS workers allegedly threw bombs at Left cadres in Kannur.  Addressing the gathering, CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over the violence.  She alleged that Shah was trying to instigate terror against the Left cadres in Kerala, but the people of the state would not bow down in front of the RSS or the BJP. .

VRecorded between October 1963 and September 1965, collection features eight songs band has never recorded or released commercially. The Rolling Stones will collect 18 recordings the band performed on the BBC from 1963 to 1965 for the upcoming compilation 'On Air.'. The Rolling Stones will collect 18 recordings the band performed on the BBC from 1963 to 1965 for the upcoming compilation On Air. The collection, due out December 1st, culls the Rolling Stones' performances from BBC shows like Saturday Club, The Joe Loss Pop Show, Blues in Rhythm, Top Gear and Yeah Yeah. Eight of the performances found On Air features songs the Rolling Stones have never recorded or released commercially. All the appearances took place in a two-year span from October 1963 \u2013 where the group performed their debut single "Come On" \u2013 to September 1965. On Air features Stones originals like "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction," "The Last Time" and "The Spider and the Fly" alongside covers of songs popularized by Chuck Berry ("Memphis, Tennessee," "Roll Over Beethoven," "Around and Around," "Beautiful Delilah"), Bo Diddley ("Cops and Robbers") and more. On Air is available to preorder now in a variety of formats, including a deluxe edition that houses additional 14 recordings the Rolling Stones made for the BBC. The Stones are also offering a bundle that packages the album with the recently published coffee table book The Rolling Stone \u2013 On Air. For On Air, the original tapes from the BBC have undergone "a process called 'audio source separation,' which involved de-mixing the transcripts and allowing engineers at Abbey Road access to the original instrumentation and voices within each track, so that they could be rebuilt, rebalanced and remixed to achieve a fuller, more substantial sound," the band's rep said. The release of the On Air follows the Rolling Stones' covers LP Blue & Lonesome, a similarly blues-heavy affair. On Air Track List. 1. "Come On" Saturday Club, 26 October 1963. 2.

VVirat Kohli led 'Men in Blue' would look to extend their winning streak against the Aussies and wrap up the T20 series when they take them on in the second T20 at Guwahati on Monday.  New Delhi :  . Virat Kohli led 'Men in Blue' would look to extend their winning streak against the Aussies and wrap up the T20 series when they take them on in the second T20 at Guwahati on Monday. The ACA-Barsapara Stadium will be making its international debut with tomorrow's match, adding to the growing list of cricket venues in the country. The India-Australia limited-overs series so far has been a one-sided a contest as Virat Kohli and Co. effortlessly grabbed the ODI rubber 4-1. Extending the domination in the three-match T20I series, India routed Australia by nine wickets in the rain-hit opening match two days back in Ranchi to take a 1-0 lead. Their T20I rivalry is lopsided as India have won 10 and lost four out of the 14 matches played. The hosts have won seven matches in a row, and they have not lost to Australia in T20Is since September 28, 2012. The visitors will have to play out of their skins to arrest the slide and level the series ahead of the last T20I in Hyderabad on October 13. For that to happen, Australia will have to unravel the mystery of India's latest wrist spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal who have shared 16 wickets between them in four ODIs and one T20I. The duo has been the big difference between the two sides as Australia have failed to read their variations and looked inept in exploiting the conditions. It's surprising given that most of the Australian batsmen are familiar with the conditions here having played in the Indian Premier League. On the other hand, the Indian team members are complementing each other well, be it in batting or bowling. . It was evident in Ranchi when Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah's giving of easy runs was easily arrested by Yadav and Chahal. The Australian batting has mostly revolved around the top three of Warner, Finch and Steve Smith, and with the skipper ruled out of the series with a shoulder injury, it would be a challenge to counter the Indian spin challenge and bounce back in the series. Australia would hope that the big-hitting Glenn Maxwell returns to form after a pathetic run of 39, 14, 5 in the ODIs and 17 in the opening T20I. That all his dismissals have come against Chahal underlines the all-rounder's inability to tackle leg-spin and he would be desperate to come out of his disastrous run. Thankfully his team is backing him fully. "We've seen him be so dominant, so destructive of attacks in these conditions before. I don't think he's far away at all. He's hitting the ball in the nets, he's up and about in the field," Finch said in full support of Maxwell. It would also be interesting to see how Finch tackles Yadav this time. In Ranchi, he chose to play more sweep shots before being cleaned up by Yadav with a fuller delivery. Nathan Coulter-Nile, who with 10 wickets was the highest wicket-taker in the ODI series, has been the silver-lining for Australia while left-arm pacer Jason Behrendorff also showed some promise in his debut in Ranchi. Australia would hope that the pace duo rock the Indian batting line-up, which had little match practice in a six-over contest in Ranchi. Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan returned to the team in Ranchi after opting out of the ODI series and it was pleasing to see him pick up the length early and play the pull shot. His easy comeback also means that the in-form Ajinkya Rahane's absence would not be missed. Dhawan and skipper Virat Kohli steered the small chase in the first T20I and Australia would look to rock the top-order, including Rohit Sharma, who was the top run-getter in the ODI series. There may be some surprise element from the pitch which will be hosting its first international match. The ACA-Barsapara Stadium made headlines in the last Ranji season when Hyderabad bowled out Himachal Pradesh for 36, the fourth-lowest total in the Ranji Trophy since 2000. Teams (from). India: Virat Kohli (c), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ashish Nehra, Dinesh Karthik, KL Rahul and Axar Patel. Australia: David Warner (c), Jason Behrendorff, Dan Christian, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa, Marcus Stoinis, Andrew Tye.

Sidharth has submitted his Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Dr. Sanjoy Ghosh and he has recently been awarded the Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Government of India. The grant-in-aid is of up to Rs 50 Lakh for 18 months for this project. The Foundation for Innovation and Technology transfer (FITT) in IIT Delhi is one of the BIG partners and is associated with Sidharth for providing mentoring support and project monitoring. What is Phytase and where is it used?. \u201cPhytase is extensively used as an additive by the animal feed industry, primarily for poultry, cattle and fisheries feed. It enhances the nutritional value of the feed. Currently, thermostable Phytase is imported mostly from China and is expensive,\u201d explains Sidharth. Phytase is an enzyme that improves the digestibility of phosphorous, calcium, amino acids and energy thus increasing the nutritional value of the feed. The Phytase has to be thermostable as it is usually given in pellet form to the animals. The advantage of the enzyme produced by Sidharth and team is that it suitable for production as pellets and are also acid stable so as to remain viable in the digestive tract of the animal (where the pH may be as low as 1.5). IIT-R research scholar and team have come up with a novel bioreactor. Production and future plans:. Sidharth and team achieved Phytase production in a novel bioreactor technology making it cost effective. The team used \u2018solid-state fermentation\u2019 that uses agro-waste as a substrate for the fermentation.  An ideal SSF bioreactor should operate at high substrate loading and maintain strict aseptic conditions. The present invention claims to achieve this feat. The bioreactor technology also promises to be of immense use in solid waste management and pollution control as well. Farmers burn crop stubs causing air and soil pollution. A patent has been filed for the design and mode of operation of the SSF bioreactor. Based on his research output and funding support, he has founded a company called \u2018Fermentech Labs\u2019. It is presently being incubated at TIDES Business Incubator, IIT Roorkee. He has also worked on a scale-up plan for the next five years that shows the Phytase production capacity and growth in revenue generation over a period of time using the SSF Bioreactor technology. Benefits for the Environment and Farmers:. Farmers across the Punjab \u2013 Haryana belt burn the crop stubs after every harvest. The structural compositions of these stubs consist of lignin and cellulose that can be used as substrate for microorganisms to produce industrial enzymes like Phytase. \u201cWe could convince the farmers to stop burning the crop stubs and transport them to us where we can use it as a substrate.\u201d. \u201cThis will not only help in mitigating air and soil pollution due to the burning of agro-waste but also provide the farmers with a mode of disposal of agro-waste as well as become a potential source of revenue. Thus helping to improve the air quality and soil fertility,\u201d adds Sidharth. Agro waste could become potential source of revenue. Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Government of India is designed to stimulate commercialization of research discoveries by providing very early stage grants to help bridge the gap between discovery and invention (source: http://www.birac.nic.in/).

V Thor 2: Alternate Malekith Design Revealed in Honor of Ragnarok . With only weeks to go until Chris Hemsworth once again wields the mighty Mjölnir in Thor: Ragnarok, fans are given a fresh look at the God of Thunder\u2019s previous outing and some original concept art for the villainous Malekith. Continuing the trend of the MCU\u2019s villain problem, Doctor Who alumni Christopher Eccleston stuck on the prosthetics to play Malekith the Accursed in 2013\u2019s Thor: The Dark World. While a different design may not have helped the movie\u2019s big bad stand out any further from the crowd, there is no denying that the Malekith that Disney settled on was certainly different from his comic book counterpart. Taking to Instagram, Marvel concept artist Andy Park is celebrating the arrival of Ragnarok and unveiled some of his original designs for the Dark Elf of Svartalfheim, to show comic book lovers what they could\u2019ve had in Alan Taylor\u2019s MCU film:.  #ThorRagnarok is about a month away! But let's take a look back at his previous cinematic adventure. I especially enjoyed exploring concept designs for Malekith. Here's one that was very similar to his comic book look. #malekith #thor #villian #darkelf #conceptart #costume #design #digitalart #illustration #\uadf8\ub9bc #\uadf8\ub9bc\uc2a4\ud0c0\uadf8\ub7a8 #marvel #marvelstudios. A post shared by Andy Park (@andyparkart) on Oct 4, 2017 at 8:54am PDT. \u2013.  Closeup of another Malekith concept design I painted up on #ThortheDarkWorld #thor #villian #conceptart #costume #design #digitalart #illustration #\uadf8\ub9bc #\uadf8\ub9bc\uc2a4\ud0c0\uadf8\ub7a8 #marvel #marvelstudios. A post shared by Andy Park (@andyparkart) on Oct 5, 2017 at 8:59am PDT. \u2013. In particular, note that the long-haired version of Malekith is much more in keeping with the supervillain that Walt Simonson first introduced in Thor #344 back in 1984. Looking like sort of demented Lucius Malfoy, this was the look that most comic book fans expected Eccleston to appear as in the Thor sequel. As for the second design, notice that Malekith has a much more technologically advanced look, and even bears an uncanny resemblance to other MCU villain Nebula. Ultimately, Taylor went with the masked version that audiences saw on their screens in The Dark World, and who knows whether a simple tweak to the look would\u2019ve made any difference at all. Thor: The Dark World, by most accounts, is the dark sheep of the MCU back catalogue. Plagued with problems from day one \u2013 including, the departure of Patty Jenkins as the film\u2019s original director \u2013 it is no surprise that The Dark World is the lowest-rated Marvel movie since the MCU kicked off with Iron Man in 2008. Among the biggest problems were a lackluster plot to release the Aether over the nine realms and many feeling that Eccleston\u2019s performance as Malekith didn\u2019t hit the spot. With too much of the story taking place on Earth, there was also that lamented final battle where Eccleston\u2019s forgettable bad guy was crushed by his own ship. Being one of the few MCU villains to meet their maker after the first outing, it isn\u2019t even like the character can be redeemed with another cinematic outing and an outfit change. Thankfully, it seems that lessons have been learned from The Dark World \u2013 and going for a garish neon tone and upping the fun factor for Ragnarok, hopes are high that Taika Waititi can strike the franchise with a bolt of box office lightning. As for Thor: Ragnarok\u2018s main villain, at least Waititi is sticking with a more comic book-accurate representation of Hela, Goddess of Death.  Key Release Dates .

VWe hope car companies keep making them as long as possible.  There are many things we like about our 2018 Jaguar F-Pace long-term car, as well as some things we don't care for, but easily one of the best things about it is the engine. Under the hood is the 380-horsepower supercharged V6 that Jaguar offers on other models. That amount of power would be fun in just about any car with any engine, but there are specific reasons why this particular engine is special, and it's because of that supercharger.  Supercharged engines have a very different character than increasingly common turbo engines. One of the most noticeable differences being engine response. Unlike turbo engines, the F-Pace's V6 feels hardwired to your foot. Every extra millimeter of pedal travel yields a slightly greater amount of tug. And the tug is felt immediately. Even the best turbo engines have a hard time recreating this response. The power band is very linear, as well, so you know exactly what you're getting every time you hit the gas.  The engine is wonderfully torquey, too. Because the Jaguar's engine uses a classic Roots-type blower, there's a major improvement in low-end torque. This means that our F-Pace has loads of grunt for punting around at low-rpm and can seriously move when tromping on the gas. And because of the near-instant throttle response and linear power band, it doesn't slam you in the back unexpectedly like some turbo engines do.  Despite how great these supercharged engines are to experience, we're concerned that supercharged engines like this may disappear in all but ultra-limited production, high-performance cars such as the Chevy Corvette Z06 and Cadillac CTS-V. The reason being that car companies have to keep making cars more fuel efficient and lower emitting. Putting a supercharger on an engine is adding a handicap, since it takes engine power to spin the belt-driven supercharger. And when a turbo, which uses wasted energy from exhaust gas to spin the compressor and built boost, can effectively do the same thing, it's hard to make a case for a supercharger.  We won't give up hope completely, though. Mazda is using superchargers on its spark-assisted compression ignition gasoline engines. And while we're not sure how powerful and sporty those will be, Mazda has said that it's going with superchargers for exactly the reasons we like the Jaguar engine: smooth power and fast throttle response. They're also expected to be 10- to 30-percent more efficient than regular gasoline engines, so they should meet regulations for a while into the future. Until those engines roll out though, we'll continue to enjoy the one in our Jag.

ESPN didn't say what exactly Hill had done to warrant the two-week suspension; however, Hill sent a series of tweets the week before denouncing Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who had recently threatened to bench players who didn't stand for the national anthem. Hill further suggesting that those who oppose Jones should boycott companies that advertise at Cowboys games. . "Jerry Jones also has created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones," Hill wrote after Jones issued the ultimatum. "If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts." Later, Hill wrote that "if you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers.". ESPN's Statement on Jemele Hill: pic.twitter.com/JkVoBVz7lv. \u2014 ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) October 9, 2017 .

VRUGBY LEAGUE is set to appoint it's first female match official for the World Cup after Belinda Sleeman was included in the 26-strong list of officials. Sleeman was the first women to officiate in a Test match between Fiji and Tonga as a touch judge. Belinda Sleeman is set to become the first women ref in the rugby league World Cup. And she made history along with Kasey Badger as the first female officials appointed to a rugby league finals match between Manly and Penrith. James Child, who refereed his first Super League Grand Final on Saturday, will also be officiating at the World Cup, along with video referee Phil Bentham and touch judges Mark Craven and Chris Kendall. Chosen by head of officiating Tony Archer and the Rugby Football League's Steve Ganson, the squad is drawn entirely from the NRL and Super League for the first time. The RFL representatives also include Ben Thaler, Robert Hicks, Scott Mikalauskas and Liam Moore, as well as former Super League officials Tim Roby and Ashley Klein, who now referee in the NRL. Belinda Sleeman was included in the 26-strong list of officials. Sleeman was the first women to officiate in a Test match between Fiji and Tonga as a touch judge. The officials will be based in Brisbane throughout the tournament, which begins in Melbourne on October 27 when Australia play England. And they will have their own performance manager, a physiotherapist, a logistics and operations manager and three coaches - Ganson, Australia's former Super League referee Russell Smith and New Zealand's Luke Watts. Archer said: "This is an historical tournament in which all match officials qualified by officiating in either the NRL or Super League competitions. "We have the Grand Final officials from each competition and there is a wealth of international and representative depth in the squad.". Most read in rugby league. HARD TIME.

Archer, who said performances during the tournament would determine the appointment for the final in Brisbane on December 2, confirmed that international rules would be used. That means one referee, as opposed to two in the NRL, and an in-goal video referral system to replace the Australian bunker. There will also be no shot clock for scrums and goal-line drop-outs but there will be a seventh tackle from the 20-metre re-start if the ball is kicked dead and a tap re-start from a 40-20 kick.

VSome mornings you really need makeup but don\u2019t have the time. Anyone who can manage to wear foundation with a perfect finish within minutes is most certainly worthy of worship. For those of us who lack the talents, there\u2019s always BB cream. In this article, I\u2019m going to review Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB cream. Also known as blemish base, beauty balm, blemish balm, and beblesh balm in different part of the world, BB cream helps give your skin subtle coverage and light moisturization. It\u2019s an essential product for anyone who is constantly on the go. The best part is that BB creams are usually quite budget-friendly. Keep reading to find out how Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream fared in this review. Maybelline Clear Glow Bright Benefit Cream Review. Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream is described as a \u201cbright benefit cream\u201d rather than a beauty balm. The product claims to give you superior and flawless coverage with its special mineral clay formula. This BB cream from Maybelline offers 12 hours of shine control while acting as a concealer and moisturizer. It also offers sun protection with an SPF 21 and PA++ formula. This product offers 8 amazing benefits. The all in one formula claims to leave you with a matte finish, protect your skin from harmful UV rays, and conceal blemishes, while brightening, smoothening, evening out, refining, and hydrating your skin. Shades. The Maybelline Clear Glow All In One Bright Benefit Cream comes in three shades \u2013 01 Nude, 02 Radiance, and 03 Natural, with 01 Nude being the darkest and 03 Natural being the lightest. Features. Hydrates and nourishes your skin. Offers sun protection. Suits all skin types. Dermatologically tested. Allergy-tested. Non-comedogenic. Does not irritate sensitive skin. Gives a matte finish. Sweat and sebum resistant for up to 5 hours. Evens out your skin tone. Smoothes your skin and makes it softer. Conceals blemishes. Keep reading to find out whether it comes through on these claims. Packaging. Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream is packaged in a plastic tube. The light teal tube-type packaging is small and holds 18 mL of product. The screw cap and narrow nozzle ensure that there is no spillage or wastage, making it extremely travel-friendly. Although hard to read, the packaging also mentions the full list of ingredients along with benefits and directions for use. Ingredients. The ingredients list is impossible to discern. However, yours truly managed to figure out what this product is packed with. This formula is free of parabens and contains a variant of vitamin C that helps brighten your skin. However, it contains Benzyl Alcohol and Titanium Dioxide which aren\u2019t ingredients I\u2019d look for in a product. AQUA/WATER, ETHYLHEXYL, PALMITATE, NIACINAMIDE, SILICA, OCTYLDODECANOL, TALC, OCTYLDODECYL, XYLOSIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, ISOHEXADECANE, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, ASCORBYL GLUCOSE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, DISODIUM EDTA, CITRIC ACID, POLYSORBATE 80, POTASSIUM SORBATE, PARFUM/FRAGRANCE, HEXYL CINNAMAL, BENZYL SALICYLATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, LINALOOL LIMONENE, MAY CONTAIN TITANIUM DIOXIDE, IRON OXIDES, AND CI 77499, CI 77482, CI 77481. My Experience And Review. I stumbled upon the Maybelline Clear Glow Bb Cream at the supermarket when my old product had run out. Having heard a lot of positive reviews, I made space for it in my cart (literally.) And I haven\u2019t had much use for my foundation and sunscreen since. Shades And Availability. The product comes in three shades \u2013 0 1 Nude, 02 Radiance, and 03 Natural. This is a bit disappointing as it only caters to consumers with light to slightly dusky skin tones. I decided to buy 01 Nude and 03 Natural because I had a hard time figuring out which one would suit me, and turns out there is not much of a difference in both the shades. While both of them work just fine for my face, I swatched them on my hand, which has a bit of a tan, and both shades left a white cast even thoughI had given it time to oxidize. The white cast that 01 Nude (on the left in the picture above) left behind was slightly less apparent than the one left behind by the latter (on the right.) For a product that is being marketed for an Indian consumer base, the unavailability of shades is a huge disappointment. Coverage. In the image above I swatched two Maybelline Clear Glow BB Cream Shades \u2013 01 Nude (Left) 03 Natural (Right). While the coverage is light, it is enough to even out your skin tone while masking redness and healing acne scars. Although the cream cannot fully replace foundation, it does make for an excellent base on the days when I choose to wear heavy makeup, and on the days when I go for the natural no-makeup look. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and makes my skin look smoother and evenly toned. As you can see in the image, while the shades aren\u2019t very far apart, 01 Nude is closer to my skin tone and blended beautifully. Texture. The cream feels extremely light on my face and spreads evenly regardless of whether I use a brush, sponge, or my fingers. It is neither too runny nor too thick, but has the perfect consistency for efficient blending. Fragrance. It has a subtle and pleasant fruity fragrance which has me swatching and sniffing all day. However, the fragrance fades quite quickly. Performance. Since I have light skin, I haven\u2019t had a problem with the white cast that these BB creams tend to leave behind on darker skin tones. The cream instantly brightens and mattifies my normal-combination skin, and controls oiliness at my T-zone. It also makes for a perfect base for my foundation, but on most days it provides more than enough coverage by itself. It subtly masks my healing acne scars and completely evens out redness, and brightens up my under eyes, giving my skin a flawless finish. I\u2019ve been using the product for about 3 weeks now, and it has still not run out. Pros. Comes through on all of its claims. Offers sun protection. Travel-friendly packaging. Non-comedogenic (doesn\u2019t clog your pores). Instantly brightens your face. Controls oiliness to a certain extent. Gives you a matte finish. Does not cause breakouts. Covers minor blemishes. Easily available. Reduces the appearance of pores and fine lines. Cons. The unavailability of shades for people with darker skin tones. Small quantity. Not suitable for oily skin during summers. How To Use Maybelline Clear Glow BB Cream?. Squeeze a dime-sized amount of BB cream onto the back of your hand. Using your finger, apply five dots of the cream on your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. Make sure that all the dots have an equal amount of the cream. Using your finger, a brush, or a sponge, gentle blend the cream into your skin. If there is any cream left at the back of your hand, use it to cover up any visible blemishes or dark circles. When working the cream at your under-eye area, gently pat instead of rubbing. Shelf Life. 36 months from the date of manufacture. Price. 18mL for Rs. 250/-. Rating. 4/5- I would have given this cream a better rating if only there were more shades made available for Indian skin. Do I Recommend Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow BB Cream?. I would recommend BB cream to women with light skin, and ones with combination, normal, or dry skin types. It is most suitable for people who do not have a lot of skin issues as it helps even out your skin tone by covering up redness, slight pigmentation, and light marks. However, it does not offer heavy coverage for people who might have excessive acne scars or pigmentation. If you are constantly on the go (and have light skin) this is the product for you. The only thing keeping me from saying that I love this product is the unavailability of shades. Have you ever used Maybelline\u2019s Clear Glow Bright Benefit Cream?

VMumbai: After more than a year\u2019s silence on his row with Kangana Ranaut, Hrithik Roshan has decided to open up and clear the air surrounding the controversy. While the actor had communicated only through legal notices till now, he chose to break the norm with his first-ever social media post, followed by a TV interview. After his comments on an interview with Arnab Goswami on Saturday went viral, the actor also spoke to with CNN News 18\u2019s Bhupendra Chaubey on Sunday. During the interview, the actor revealed that despite being claiming that he's been harassed for four years, there was only one instance when he broke down. Popular dairy brand Amul is known for its interesting cartoons on various current topics, but the one on the Hrithik-Kangana row didn\u2019t go down well with the \u2018Kaabil\u2019 actor. He said, "The only time I actually had tears in my eyes was when I saw this huge Amul hoarding with my brand Krrish, which is something that is built by me, it is like my baby. And that brand was completely demolished on that visual. And it said something like Krrish being run out, being caught stealing some cheese or something. That was probably the only day when I felt that this is not right.". He further said, "I date it back to my first film Kaho Na Pyar Hai when the same Amul hoarding had me up and called me a phenomenon. And I just watched the entire journey and I said, 'You know, I have to find a way to detach from the hoarding that said I was a phenomenon and I have to find a way to detach from the Amul hoarding that is making me look like this disgusting creep. I really need to find what I think of myself as my identity. And I need to work on that. And I need to make it so strong that I can be bullet-proof against any perceptions from the outside world. That is a failing from all of us. We build our identity with what others say about us. That is how we have been brought up. Your parent tells you you are strong, you are strong. This was a fantastic lesson for me. Hard one, but to be walking into a party all by myself and still be able to contribute to people, make people laugh, spread positivity while they are looking at the hoardings and judging me.". Hrithik\u2019s friend, actor-director Farhan Akhtar wrote an open letter in support of him on gender discrimination when it comes to accusations made by a man against a woman as compared to a woman against a man. And Hrithik also reiterated it on the interview, he said, \u201cThe movie Pink inspired and affected me so much. But it also got me thinking, why 'No means No' only applies to a woman?\u201d. Hirthik got divorced from his ex-wife Sussanne in 2014, but the actor denies that his alleged affair with Kangana was the reason for it. He said, "Absolutely not. Sussanne has been very very vocal about this. She has been very vocal. And I feel like laughing at people. When people get divorced, it is not always because of infidelity by the man. That is just such a small-minded assumption. I am just trying to say that there are many reasons why people would like to live separate lives. Infidelity is just one of them. So the general assumption was, 'Ah he is the superstar, he must have done something wrong. She must have caught him.' That is not the case. We are great friends. It is between us. The reason that we decided to live separately may have been an inspiring reason, how do you know?\u201d. He also revealed that the controversy also affected his sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan. "I am being harassed as a father. I have kids going to school who may be teased and I am not okay with it.". He added, "People are saying that these two people are washing their laundry in the public. But it's not my laundry!". With Kangana usually being very prompt in her responses, be it through legal notices or statements through her lawyer, another sensational claim from her side is very much on the anvil.

VThomas Muller has welcomed Jupp Heynckes' return to Bayern Munich and aimed a parting shot at Carlo Ancelotti in the process. Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller. Thomas Muller has aimed criticism at former head coach Carlo Ancelotti by saying Bayern Munich "will have good training again" following the return of Jupp Heynckes. Ancelotti was sacked 24 hours after Bayern were beaten 3-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, with former boss Heynckes announced as his replacement until the end of the season after Willy Sagnol had initially been put in temporary charge. President Uli Hoeness claimed Ancelotti lost the support of five senior players at the club and there have been reports in Germany that his laid-back training sessions had begun to frustrate some of the squad. Arjen Robben was said to have criticised the sessions but vehemently denied the claims, while Mats Hummels has also dismissed suggestions he was among those to turn against the Italian. But Muller, who struggled for form for much of Ancelotti's year in charge, has welcomed the return of treble-winning coach Heynckes and admitted he hopes for an improvement in Bayern's preparations. "We will have a good training again," he was quoted as saying by Welt after Germany's 5-1 World Cup qualifying win over Azerbaijan. "Heynckes is the right man because he can inspire the team to have the ability to suffer more, to have more commitment and a better defensive set-up. "Heynckes will work with interest and passion. There are several screws that need to be turned. The team have some responsibilities to carry out.". Bayern resume Bundesliga action against Freiburg on Saturday.

V2018 Hyundai Creta facelift will have exterior updates and interior revisions; powertrain expected to remain the same. Hyundai Motor India Limited launched the Creta compact SUV in July 2015 as an immediate response to growing young customers opting towards buying big five-seaters instead of compact hatchbacks and sedans. While meeting the latest trend, Hyundai also enjoyed export benefits from Creta as the largest exporter of passenger cars in the country hit a dual-jackpot with large volumes of shipping to South Africa, Latin America, Australia, Asia Pacific, Middle East and some African markets. The success of Hyundai Creta can be related with the fact that it\u2019s currently the bestselling model in the Indian UV segment barring Maruti Vitara Brezza. As Brazilian market holds significance for products introduced by automakers in India due to the more or less similar road conditions, the Brazil-spec Creta gives major answers for an apparent facelift to us. Due to the recent anti-diesel vibe, Hyundai could follow the lines of Maruti Suzuki and introduce a similar mild-hybrid system that would boost fuel economy by up to 5 percent. While the tech could be employed in the facelifted Creta SUV in a similar fashion to the facelifted S-Cross, there are reports that mild-hybrid plans had already been axed by the brand due to the withdrawal of government benefits. Hyundai will most likely launch the facelifted Elite i20 early next year while the top-selling Grand i10 already received an update in early 2017. With the new-gen Verna making huge strides in the sales chart, the revised Creta will look to consolidate its position at the top of SUV charts in its segment. Here\u2019s everything you need to know the 2018 Creta from Indian market\u2019s perspective:. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift India Launch. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Launch. Second Half Of 2018. Hyundai showcased the facelifted Creta at the 2016 Sao Paulo Motor Show with styling updates and it has triggered a mid-life update for India. Although no concrete launch time-frame is known yet, the facelift will reportedly be launched in the later half of next year before an all-new generation tipped for 2021. In Brazil, the facelift is manufactured at Hyundai\u2019s Piracicaba facility in Sao Paulo on full-swing as required modifications were made to the production lines in July 2016 to make way for the new compact SUV. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Expected Price. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Price. Rs. 9.5 lakh to Rs. 15 Lakh. Currently, the price for the entry-level 1.6 E Petrol starts from Rs. 9.29 lakh while it goes all the way up to Rs. 14.55 lakh (both prices ex-showroom, New Delhi) for the 1.6 Plus SX AT top-spec variant. Expect the facelift with visual updates to cost between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000 premium when compared to the existing prices. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Engine Specifications and Mileage. Enging. 1.6L Petrol / 1.4L Diesel / 1.6L Diesel. Power. 128 bhp / 89 bhp / 121 bhp. Torque. 150 Nm / 224 Nm / 265 Nm. Transmission. Six-Speed MT or Six-Speed AT / Six-Speed MT / Six-Speed MT or Six-Speed AT. Initially offered in 10 different variants, the existing Hyundai Creta is powered by three engine choices. A 1.6-litre CRDi VGT diesel engine delivers 121 bhp and 265 Nm of torque and comes paired to a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission alongside a 1.4-litre CRDi diesel rated at 89 bhp and 224 Nm of torque. The sole petrol engine available is a 122 bhp producing 1.6-litre Dual VTVT engine linked to a six-speed manual transmission. It pumps out 154 Nm torque at 4,850 rpm. In the process of expanding the lineup, the Korean brand added an automatic transmission to the petrol engine in April before a special edition Anniversary model was introduced four months later last year. For the Brazilian market, it derives powertrain from the HB20 as the 1.6-litre CVVT flex-fuel engine should be good enough to develop a maximum power output of 128 bhp and 161 Nm of peak torque. The motor is connected with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. It competes against Honda HR-V, Nissan Juke and Renault Duster in Brazil. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Mileage. 1.6L Petrol Mileage. 17 kmpl. 1.4L Diesel Mileage. 22 kmpl. 1.6L Diesel Mileage. 20 kmpl for MT and 18 kmpl for AT. The ARAI efficiency figures of the 1.6 petrol, 1.4 diesel and 1.6 diesel MT and AT are 15.29 kmpl, 21.38 kmpl, 19.67 kmpl and 17.01 kmpl respectively. On the facelift, Hyundai will likely stick with the same engine lineup but they could be tweaked to deliver better fuel economy. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Dimensions. Length. 4,270 mm. Width. 1,780 mm. Height. 1,627 mm. Wheelbase. 2,590 mm. Bootspace. 402 litres. Ground Clearance. 190 mm. Fuel Tank Capacity. 60 litres. The upcoming Hyundai Creta Facelift measures 4,270 mm in length, 1,780 mm in width, 1,627 mm in height and features a wheelbase of 2,590 mm and 402 litres of bootspace. The ground clearance stands at 190 mm while the fuel tank can hold a rated maximum of 60 litres. All these dimensions are as identical to the outgoing model. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Colours. The existing colour palette for the five-seat compact SUV contains Polar White, Phantom Black, Mystic Blue, Red Passion, Sleek Silver, Pearl Beige and Stardust options. More paint jobs could be added to make the facelift attractive further. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Exterior. The Creta is built on the same platform as the HB20 and will comprise similar assembly techniques and part sharing. The Creta, also known as Cantus in some markets, is a global version of the ix25 SUV. It willcome boasting different radiator grille with chrome surrounds and newly designed bumpers up front and rear as well as sleeker fog lamps. At the rear, the Creta is equipped with restyled tail lamp cluster with chrome strip running between the lamps and the bumper seems to have been applied with minor changes alongside new reflectors compared to the India-run model. The Brazil-spec Creta showcases identical design language as the current avatar with similar set of LED Daytime Running Lights and we can expect the same on the India-bound model. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Interior and Features. The interior of the existing Creta looks premium and upmarket. It features a multifunction steering wheel with mounted controls, stylish instrument cluster and a centre console housing a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system on the high level grades. The touchscreen infotainment system is flanked by dual AC vents on both sides which sport vertical slats and are positioned on either side of the dashboard as well. Expect minor updates to the seat upholstery and trims levels as the interior design is likely to be retained. Emphasising safety, now the Creta is offered with ABS and EBD as standard while mid variants get dual front airbags as side and curtain airbags, VSM (Vehicle Stability Management) and ESC (Electronic Stability Control) are limited to the top-end SX trim. More safety techs and equipment could adorn the facelifted model. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Key Rivals. The facelifted Creta will compete against Renault Duster, Nissan Terrano, Mahindra XUV500, Tata Hexa, Renault Captur and the likes. 2018 Hyundai Creta Facelift Images.

VWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with beer getting smarter at the shelf (and the data that is responsibly collected) it\u2019s obviously not a good idea for businesses to take things too far. No one likes that \u201cclose talker\u201d at a cocktail party. They can be downright creepy. But avoiding the creep factor isn\u2019t easy, especially when powerful capabilities like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) are on the guest list \u2014 and usually depicted as creepy forces in the world of sci-fi (I\u2019m looking at you Blade Runner and Terminator).  The reality is that A.I. and Machine Learning don\u2019t have to be creepy and they shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s what businesses do with their data that matters and how mutual value and trust is created with customers. Dealing with doomsday scenarios. So what to make of recent comments from Elon Musk who believes the \u201cglobal race for A.I. will most likely be the cause of World War III?\u201d Or the notion that Musk has embarked on a \u201cbillion dollar crusade to stop the A.I. apocalypse?\u201d No doubt about it, these are bleak, doomsday predictions of the highest order, coming from a modern-day visionary with access to bleeding-edge info, and they should be taken seriously. As for Machine Learning, well, it doesn\u2019t fare much better. Google\u2019s A.I. chief John Giannandrea recently said he isn\u2019t worried so much about Musk\u2019s war-mongering bots but he is very concerned about \u201cthe danger that may be lurking inside the machine-learning algorithms used to make millions of decisions every minute.\u201d. Yikes. Thankfully, other tech luminaries have a much sunnier disposition about A.I. and Machine Learning. Bill Gates recently told CNBC, \u201cA.I. will make our lives more productive and creative\u201d while Mark Zuckerberg believes A.I. is going to make our lives better in the future. As for the doomsday scenarios making headlines, Zuckerberg thinks they are \u201cpretty irresponsible.\u201d. Personalizing the shopping experience. Gates and Zuckerberg's thoughts are backed by serious research. IDC predicts cognitive/AI capabilities will figure in to some 40 percent of digital transformation initiatives by 2019. And at SAP\u2019s recent TechEd event, it was revealed that machine learning can help the $2.4 trillion fashion industry with a more personalized consumer experience, according to Margaret Laffan, Director of Business Development, Machine Learning at SAP. \u201cStatic window displays of the past won\u2019t work in today\u2019s world of fast fashion and consumer demands for an increasingly more personalized experience,\u201d said Laffan in a recent story, \u2018The Ultimate Personal Shopper Is A Machine.\u2019 \u201cMachine learning gives retailers the speed and intelligence to quickly match the hottest looks with every customer\u2019s fashion style.\u201d. As you can see from this video demo of what this level of personalization looks like, it becomes much easier to understand why A.I. and machine learning can improve people\u2019s lives without being creepy.

VPimples on our back and shoulders (a.k.a back acne) are a belligerent nightmare!. And while they might not be as visible as those pesky pimples that pop up on our face, they are definitely no less painful or discomforting. Plus, they seriously restrict our wardrobe choices. So if you have been fighting a fresh crop all over your back for quite some time now, then read on. Because in this article I am going to reveal how making 6 simple and healthy tweaks in your lifestyle can help you get rid of them fast.  Pimple Removal Treatment | \u092e\u0941\u0901\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0921\u093c \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u091f\u093e\u090f... by boldsky . #1 Don\u2019t Repeat Clothes. Back acne is more commonly seen during summers and humid seasons because we sweat a lot during these times. That means if you are an Indian, your back acne problem can very well last for months on end!. In such a case, the simplest way to get rid of back pimples fast is by following one rule: Never repeat your shirt/top. The reasoning behind this is simple. The sweat and dirt accumulated on your clothes are ripe grounds for bacterial growth. And repeating them simply exposes your skin to these dense microbial colonies, which leads to back acne. The rule applies to gym clothes as well. Note: If you do not have enough gym apparel, just remember to wash the sweaty ones under running water after every workout session to dislodge most of the sweat and dirt. They will dry up by the time you have to workout again. #2 Change Your Bed Sheet Once Every Week. Your bed sheet may look clean even after a few weeks, but it actually isn't. This is because your bedsheets absorb a lot of sweat and oil from your skin. Plus, the dust you see on your sheets are actually your dead skin cells. So if you are suffering from pimples on your back, make sure you change your bedsheets every week. #3 Clean Your Back. Do you clean your back every day when you take a bath?. If you are like most people, you probably don't. In fact, a lot of people are also known to skip soaping their legs daily (hint: men) since it requires more effort (read: bending over). So if you are suffering from a bad case of back acne, it's time for you to buy a back-brush and start exfoliating your back with bath scrub or body wash. #4 Use Salicylic Acid Based Soaps and Body Washes. Dermatologists most commonly prescribe salicylic acid-based face washes and soaps for regular facial acne because this medicament is a potent anti-acne agent. So if you want to get rid of the pimples on your back, you can use the same every time you take a bath. #5 Shower After a Workout. While most of us shower without fail after every workout session, there are some who postpone it because of work commitments and inconvenience. Unfortunately, that's the quickest way to develop a bad batch of pimples on your back. So if you are guilty of skipping showers after gym, please make sure to leave at least 15 minutes in your schedule for a bath. #6 Wear Your Hair Up. Forehead acne is most commonly seen in those who leave their hair hanging over their forehead. Likewise, back acne is very commonly seen in those who have long hair. This is because hair carries a lot of dirt and natural oil in it. Therefore, whatever it touches ends up with a thin film of these substances. So if you have long hair and have back acne problems, the easiest way to get rid of them is by wearing your hair up in a ponytail or a bun. Was This Article Helpful?.

VLAHORE: Fairy-the lioness has died at Lahore Zoo at the age of 18, after a protracted illness. The Lahore Zoo spokesman said on Sunday that the management of the zoo wanted to euthanise the lioness as she had been suffering from paralysis for the last eight years. He said that even then some efforts were being made to send samples of her blood to a foreign country for tests but she died before it. Fairy was born at Lahore Zoo in 1999. Earlier in August, an African lioness cub, born in captivity at the Lahore Zoo, passed away after a brief illness. This is the third cub to die at the recreational facility and now there are only six left in its cages, The Express Tribune has learnt. She said that best team of veterinary medical practitioners, including Dr Rizwan, the medical head of the zoo, and other senior consultants, had tried their best to save the life of the cub. \u201cShe stopped eating a week earlier and was being fed through drips and syringes,\u201d she added. \u201cThe cub was born in Lahore Zoo,\u201d she added. However, a zoo official, requesting anonymity, said that she died because of alleged negligence on part of the zoo staff. The official added the lioness had been sick for at least month prior to her death. Published in The Express Tribune, October 9th, 2017.  Read more: Death , Fairy the lioness , Latest .

VThree-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton was part of the [+] [-] development team for the Project One concept.    development team for the Project One concept.  . At the Frankfurt Motor Show last month, Mercedes Benz put on one of the most extravagant and entertaining stage shows ever seen at an international automotive event. After a jazz-funk band warmed up the 3,000-plus audience, Broadway singers \u2013 yes, from New York City\u2019s Broadway! \u2013 appeared on stage using their substantial vocal ranges, unmistakable stage presence, and catchy tunes to introduce Mercedes\u2019 futuristic view of a greener world inhabited by clean hybrid and electric vehicles. The highlight of this remarkable ensemble happened when three-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton drove the Mercedes-AMG Project One hypercar concept on stage to a waiting Dieter Zetsche, Daimler\u2019s charismatic CEO. As Hamilton got out of the car, he said, \u201cthat was more nerve-wracking than driving the real F1 car.\u201d. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of Daimler AG, and Lewis Hamilton [+] [-] present the new concept car Mercedes AMG Project One in Frankfurt. Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images. Now while there was some level of lip service in that comment, he was actually part of the development team of a supercar that borrows technology directly from F1. This car rewrites history. The Project One is a true watershed moment as it becomes the first ever road-legal car to employ a Formula 1 engine, a powerplant that will be built in the same factory, right next to the engine that powers Hamilton\u2019s F1 car. But for longevity and commercial viability, according to Mercedes at least, the Project One will get a down-tuned version of the F1\u2019s turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 hybrid generating upwards of 700 horsepower. The One gets another 500 hp from three electric motors, one on each front wheel, the third integrated into the engine. Total power is \u201cover 1100hp,\u201d says Mercedes. A fourth motor turns the turbocharger to ensure that you always have instant power. This engine will spin to 11,000 rpm which is down from the 15,000 max reached by the Petronas F1 car, enabling the car to reach speeds of 350 km/h. The Project One is unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. [+] [-] Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images. As one would expect in high-performance hypercars of tomorrow, the Project One also gets a precision 4WD setup with torque vectoring system that channels torque to any given wheel enabling greater grip and stability in corners. Mercedes tells us that it will make only 275 of these cars. But don\u2019t worry about checking your bank account because all 275 have already been sold.  So why does this $2.8 million car matter? Because as Mercedes calls it, \u201cProject One: Formula 1 technology for the road.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2013 the plan is to feedback some of this hypercar\u2019s technology to stock standard road-going cars for the masses. In addition to the safety systems like torque vectoring and impact absorbing lightweight materials \u2013 carbon fiber, aluminum etc \u2013 fitted to the car that will filter down to production cars, it is the technology employed in the compact, fuel efficient, high-performance engine that will be most desired by motorists. Imagine a 400hp E-Class propelled by a 1.2-liter hybrid that achieves over 50mpg. That\u2019s the kind of advancement the Project One promises in the very near future, according to Mercedes.

VLife on Earth may have started when meteorites splashed down into little warm ponds like this one in the Bumpass Hell trail in Lassen Volcanic National Park in California.  A new study bolsters the theory that the chemical origins of life on Earth were midwifed by meteorites that delivered essential building blocks from space.  Meteorites slamming into warm, small ponds on the planet's rising land surfaces more than 4 billion years ago could have delivered those building blocks into an environment where they could grow and combine into ribonucleic acid, or RNA, said Ben K.D. Pearce, an astrobiologist at Canada's McMaster University.  The study, produced by researchers at McMaster and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the latest in a debate over the origins of life. Did it come from Earth itself \u2014 forming around hot undersea vents in the crust \u2014 or from small ponds on land, as Darwin theorized, with material deposited from the cosmos around it? Pearce and his colleagues come down on the "warm little pond" side, arguing that the oceans were too harsh an environment for the building blocks of life.  RNA can reproduce itself and evolve. In its current form, it takes the genetic code contained in DNA and forms proteins.  "At one time, it was the dominant life form on Earth, and likely the first life form on Earth," Pearce told Seeker. But it's made up of a family of molecules known as nucleobases, which stem from a reactive type of nitrogen that wouldn't have formed on a lifeless early Earth. RELATED: Climate Change 5 Million Years Ago Coincided With More Mediterranean Volcanoes.  Nitrogen compounds like ammonia and hydrogen cyanide likely collected on bits of dust and rock floating around the sun, snowballing into larger bodies where they could react to produce nucleobases.  "You have get these molecules from space," he said. And when those space rocks fell to Earth, the nucleobases they held could have landed in ponds of water and reacted with other chemicals that produced RNA.  Previous studies have put forth that theory, but what Pearce and his colleagues have done is to use computer models to gauge how probable that would have been. Nucleotides would have to survive in an environment bombarded with ultraviolet light, since there was no protective ozone layer at the time, and in water that could have broken them up.  While other scientists, including the famous astronomer Carl Sagan, have theorized that cosmic dust may have delivered those precursors, Pearce said any nucleotides riding in on dust particles were likely to have been too small to survive in their new home. RELATED:Mass Extinctions on Earth Coincided With Out-of-Whack Carbon Cycles.  But by entering data "from all facets of science," including biology, geophysics, and astrophysics, they've calculated that meteorites would have been a frequent and durable enough vehicle to deliver the building blocks of life, and wet and dry cycles could have helped them bond into larger chains that formed RNA.  "There were thousands of opportunities for this to emerge from thousands of different pond environments," Pearce said.  Pearce said the next step will be to try to test that theory in a laboratory. Researchers at McMaster, located at the western end of Lake Ontario, are building a "planet simulator" in which they hope to reproduce the conditions of a primeval Earth and see whether they can get the same results.

VThe SNDT Vice Chancellor and the Board of Examination fined two distance education colleges affiliated to the (SNDT) varsity, Rs 1 lakh each on October 5 as penalty for cheating cases in 2014 and 2016. Representation pic. In 2014, during the MA (Economics) - semester-I examination, a university squad member came across a case of cheating in Viraji Bhimaji Gherwara Mahavidyalaya, Darwah. Later a committee sought a penalty of Rs 1 lakh from the college. As the college has not paid the sum saying they were not involved in cheating, a show cause notice was again issued to them on September 29. "In 2014, we had only one candidate for the MA semester-I economics exam and she was caught cheating by the university squad. This is not a case of mass cheating. This decision is totally unfair," said an official from examination department of the college. Another college, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in Nagpur, which also runs the distance learning course under the SNDT university, came under scrutiny after a case of cheating caught by the squad during a 2016 examination. "The University cannot penalise us such a huge amount. We will appeal to the varsity to reduce the penalty or else we will discontinue our tie up with them," said a trustee of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar College, Nagpur. According to a show-cause notice, the colleges are penalised under sections 14(7) and 32(6)(a)(b) of Maharashtra University Act. These sections allow the vice chancellor and the board of examination of any university to institute an inquiry against the affiliated colleges and direct disciplinary action. Expert speak. "In the past, the Mumbai university has penalised one college in Dahisar, in a case of mass copying. However, such punishments are valid only in case of mass copying," said Vinod Malale, PRO of Distance Education Department from the Mumbai University. Official speak. "From now onwards the university will be very strict if any college or persons connected to university examinations are found aiding and abetting the students to resort to use of unfair means during examinations. Such incidences shall be dealt with by the Unfair Means Inquiry Committee and the punishments will be imposed by the competent authority in accordance with the provisions of the new Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 and the prevailing ordinances related to Examinations," said Shashikala Wanjari, Vice Chancellor of SNDT University.

Huawei Mediapad T3 8" .  newegg ca item id N82E16834324023.  i am wondering if they are worth it (is it worth getting the more expensive M3 lite 8" or is the cheaper T3 8" just as good).  and i have a question about the model sold on canadian newegg (newegg ca).  do they have a MicroSD card slot (this is necessary due to them having only 16gb of internal storage).  note: i would of posted a link to the items on newegg but it wouldn't let me because i am a new member .

V The Easy Danish Dough recipe is from my book, . Easy Danish Dough.  Notes: The dough does need to rest overnight in the refrigerator, so plan accordingly. It\u2019s important for the Danish dough to come to room temperature before you roll it out, or the butter will not incorporate correctly. This dough can be frozen, but doesn\u2019t rise quite as nicely as when it\u2019s fresh. If the dough is not used right away after being out and turned, it will puff up in the refrigerator. This will make it a little harder to roll out, but you will still have good results. 3/4 cup whole milk, warm (100-110F).  1 large egg, room temperature.  2 large egg yolks, room temperature.  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract.  2 1/2 cups (355g) all-purpose flour.  2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast.  2 tablespoons sugar.  1 teaspoon salt.  4 tablespoons (1/2 stick | 57g) Land O\u2019Lakes European Style butter, room temperature.  12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks | 170g) Land O\u2019Lakes European butter, cold, cut in 1/2-inch pieces.  Apple Jelly or Apple Butter. Cream Cheese Filling.  6 ounces cream cheese, room temperature.  1/4 cup sugar.  Pinch salt.  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract.  1/2-1 teaspoon lemon juice. Glaze.  1 cup confectioner\u2019s sugar.  2-4 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream.  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract.  Pinch salt.  1/4 \u2013 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice.  1 tablespoon creme fraiche (optional). For the easy Danish dough.  Grease a large bowl. In a large liquid measuring cup, combine the milk, egg, yolks, and vanilla. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt on low. Add the room temperature butter and mix on low until it is incorporated into the flour and no pieces are visible. Add the cold butter and mix on low, until it is broken down and smashed a bit, but still in 1/2-inch pieces. Add the milk mixture and mix on low until combined. The dough will be very sticky and there will be visible lumps of butter. Using a spatula, scrape the dough into the prepared bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days. The next morning, transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Knead 10-12 times, until the dough forms a ball. Cover the top lightly with flour and cover with a tea towel, let rest until it comes to room temperature. Pat the dough into a 6-inch square and roll into a 16 by 20-inch rectangle. If the dough sticks at all, sprinkle more flour underneath it. Brush any excess flour off the dough, and, using a bench scraper, fold the short ends of the dough over the middle to made three layers, similar to a business letter. This is the first turn. Flip the dough over (seam side down) and roll into an 8 x 16-inch rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle, business letter style. Repeat the steps again, for a total of four turns. On the last turn, gently use the rolling pin to compress the layers together slightly. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour before using or keep refrigerated for 2 days. For the cream cheese filling.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the sugar, salt, vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and mix on low until completely combined. Taste the filling, and add a little more lemon juice if the flavor is dull. (The filling shouldn\u2019t taste like lemon, but a little bit of lemon juice will add a bright note to the filling. When tasting, look for a bit of a zing in your mouth that doesn\u2019t scream lemon.) Cover the filling and set aside until ready to use. For the glaze.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioner\u2019s sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, vanilla, and salt (if using the creme fraiche, add here, too). Add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin the icing to a preferred consistency. Add 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, and taste for brightness (add more if needed, but again, you don\u2019t want a lemon flavor here). To assemble.  Cut the Danish dough in two equal pieces. Roll the first piece of dough into a 10 x 14-inch rectangle, using enough flour so the dough doesn\u2019t stick to the surface or the rolling pin. Transfer the piece of dough to a piece of parchment paper (this will make moving the braid much easier). Spread half of the cream cheese filling down the center of the dough, about 1 1/2 inches wide. Top the cream cheese with about 3/4 cup of the apple jelly. Carefully cut 1/2-inch thick strips of dough (a pastry cutter works best here), doing your best to make the strips even and equal on both sides. Starting with the top two pieces, gently twist then cross the pieces over the top of the filling. Continue the same motion of twisting the pieces and crossing them all the way down the braid. When you get to end of the braid, tuck the loose ends underneath the braid (this way they won\u2019t pop out when baking). Repeat with the second piece of dough. Move the braids (on the parchment) to baking sheets, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the braid rise until puffy (similar to a marshmallow when pressed), about 1 1/2 hours. Adjust an oven rack to the lower middle position. Preheat the oven to 350F. (I like to bake mine one at a time, but you could bake them together \u2013 adjust oven racks instead to upper and lower middle positions, then rotate sheets to opposite oven racks half way through baking. Lightly brush the braids with egg wash. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer the baking sheets to a wire rack and let cool slightly. Drizzle the braids with the glaze.

VOct 09, 2017: Comparing the futile debates in Karnataka over teaching Kannada mandatorily in schools, government schools in Melbourne, Australia, are already teaching the language to their students. There\u2019s more to it: Students there can even opt for Kannada as the second language for their Class 12 board examination. For the first time, schools run by the Victoria Government in Australia are teaching Kannada, starting this year. It is being implemented through Victoria School of Languages (VSL), Melbourne. The Melbourne Kannada Sangha had submitted a report to the VSL, requesting them to introduce Kannada as an optional language in government schools. Considering the report and the number of Kannadigas living in Melbourne, the VSL implemented it from January this year. Since then, classes have been running on a weekly basis and conducted during weekends for three hours at a stretch. For now, Kannadigas working there are teaching students and are being paid by the government. Vasan Srinivasan, member of Australian Multicultural Council, said, \u201cSchools here have an option to opt for any international language as a second language. This year, they introduced Kannada as one of the Indian languages to be taught in schools. Textbooks from K\u2019taka: P5. The teaching materials, including text books, are airlifted from Karnataka to Australia, said Srirangan Kanzal, a healthcare professional. \u201cThe language is taught in three levels. For beginners, we teach basics like Varnamale (alphabets). For those who already know the basics, the syllabus will be upgraded,\u201d he said. \u201cInitially, we use the translation method (English to Kannada) to familiarise them with the language. Later, we teach them to read and write. Now, we are teaching them Kannada rhymes,\u201d Kanzal added. \u201cAs there are no examins till Class 12 here, students can pick any language. If they are confident of scoring good marks, they can opt for any international language as second language for the Class 12 board exam,\u201d said Vasan Srinivasan, member of Australian Multicultural Council.

VDesigner Shilpa Tibrewala.  Chennai: . Now, the art teacher who has been living in Chennai for the past two decades, has finally come out with a boutique of her own in the city to nurture this interest. . \u201cMy advent into textile designing started with my art career. I have been interested in art since childhood and that later on expanded into an interest in weaves. I was teaching art a few years ago and the mothers of some of my students noticed the eye I had for picking good fabrics. They wanted me to pick out fabrics for them as well. . So, I started doing this as a home-based business for a while. Since both my father and grandfather were involved in the textile business, it was easier for me to find my footing. . At first there were just 40 people I was catering to. Then that became 80 and 180 and soon I had a good client base. This is how I decided to launch the present store, Artt n Attire. Our collection caters to the women who want to be simple and traditionally modern. It comprises handwoven sarees, suits, dupattas and lehengas curated, designed and handpicked from the corners of Varanasi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and the like,\u201d says Shilpa. . Shilpa adds that it is the giving back to the handloom industry that brings a lot of joy. \u201cWe provide skill training to many artisans who are involved in the handloom business in the hope that we can make them financially stronger and independent. . These are skills handed down for generations that had once put India on the map for the greatness of its textiles. We hope to revive that success,\u201d she explains.

VPhoto: 123rf. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most common mental health issues faced by Singaporeans, according to a study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health in 2010. In fact, one in 33 Singaporeans are affected by OCD in their lifetime. People with OCD tend to fear contamination and diseases. They also suffer from irrational fears and feel a need for routines, symmetry and patterns. Unfortunately, OCD is often dismissed as a personality quirk when, in fact, it is a severely debilitating illness, marked by obsessions \u2013 unwanted, persistent urges that trigger intense distress. Dr Jeanie Chu, Clinical Psychologist at The Resilienz Clinic, adds that it\u2019s especially important to realise that obsessions aren\u2019t always physical, such as cleaning rituals or setting things in perfect order. Instead, they can be \u201cthoughts zipping through the mind, which we cannot see\u201d. OCD causes the mind to revolve around certain themes, with the dread of contamination and disease taking top spot. Irrational fears of harm \u2013 \u201cdid I switch the stove off?\u201d \u2013 are another. An urgent need for symmetry and patterns is famously documented in the life of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, who uses repetitive visuals to \u201cobliterate\u201d the hallucinations in her head. Photo: 123rf. Yayoi Kasuma\u2019s famed art is an outlet for her OCD. When does a seemingly innocent habit of double checking things (did you send that text to the right person?) become an indicator of OCD? Frances Yeo, Consultant Psychologist at Thomson Medical Centre says the difference is that with normal day-to-day habits, \u201c\u2026people do not feel anxious once they\u2019re completed. Compulsions, however, are repetitive behaviours that arise to get rid of said obsessions or to reduce anxiety.\u201d. Personal story:. For 10 years, starting in her late 20s, Charlotte* refrained from going out whenever possible. Each time she left the house, she would feel \u201ccontaminated\u201d and the need to wipe down the house on her return. This would take at least seven hours. Her family would obey her OCD requests \u2013 walking where she said they could, or washing their hair at her request. But says Dr Jeanie, \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that engaging in compulsive actions on behalf of the sufferers creates a co-dependent relationship, which fuels the obsessive compulsive disorder.\u201d. Charlotte had to take baby steps to conquer OCD. She practised leaving the house or going out with her mother, and while she sometimes still feels \u201cdirty\u201d from being outside, she also feels empowered. She now works part-time at a jewellery shop and volunteers as a Peer Support Specialist at IMH. If you suspect a friend could be suffering, here are a few things you can do: Listen closely to their feelings and try not to give solutions. Instead gently advise them to get help early, and be supportive. Check in on them when possible, to see how they are coping. These helplines are available in Singapore:.

VThis is part of CNN Style's coverage on the "Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World." The exhibition will be shown at the Guggenheim Museum Oct. 6, 2017 to Jan. 7, 2018. . In 1997, conceptual artist Xu Zhen filmed himself smashing a dead cat repeatedly against a concrete floor. A year later, in a video called "Shouting," he let out a series of loud screams in Shanghai's streets and captured the crowds' bemusement as they turned to face the waiting camera. Xu, who was then in his early 20s, was building a career on hoaxes, pranks and shock value. But, two decades later, one of China's most talked about artists has come of age.  1  /  11   \u2013  "Shouting" (1998) . "Shouting" is one of Xu's earlier works, where he let out screams in crowded public spaces and recorded people's reactions. Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen . The once censored provocateur is now the CEO of his own art company. More likely to exercise irony than provoke outrage, Xu has assumed the role of reformed upstart and mentor for a new generation of Chinese artists. "I think they're different," said the 40-year-old, from his Shanghai studio. "The youngest artists focus on matters of their own lives, like sex and human relations. A few years later, they will grow interested in social issues -- economy, business models, the Internet. "The artists we work with vary in age, born between 1985 to 1994. Society changes so fast so that, even in this 10-year period, there have been two or three (different) generations.". Becoming a brand. The fact that Xu can present himself as an elder statesman is testament to the speed at which China's art world is changing. (He says he's seen it pass through "four or five general phases" since the mid-1980s.) . But it also speaks to his ability to adapt to the times. The foundation of MadeIn Company in 2009 was a defining moment of this transition. It was a move that effectively ended Xu's solo career, transforming him from artist to brand, rebel to CEO. Xu describes it as his "art-creation" company. . Operating like Warhol's Factory, MadeIn's Shanghai exhibition space blurs the line between gallery and shop. It displays the work of up-and-coming talent (alongside Xu's own work), branded clothes, furniture and accessories. .  "Eternity Parthenon" (2014) Upside Buddha figures sit atop reproductions of Greek statues.    Credit:  Madein Company/Xu Zhen . Further out of the city, MadeIn's 54,000-square-foot headquarters boasts an exhibition hall and five separate workshops. "Some think there's a gap between art-lovers and non-art lovers," he said. "I'm interested in making art more accessible. Every piece of clothing, every meal you pick, everything is culture. I think (art) is not limited to painters (or) photographers. The momentum to create art is everywhere.". As well as creating art, the company undertakes research and publishing, with departments dedicated to media relations, planning, production and design. "We're not turning an art studio into a factory. We're turning an art studio into a brand," he said. "Under the brand, there are productions (and) various parts of the art industry. Why did I set up Madein Company to make art? Because in China, the form of a company has more freedom than individuals.". Market demands. Born in 1977, the year after Mao Zedong's death, Xu has regularly critiqued China's journey from collectivism to consumerism. In one of his best-known installations, "Supermarket" (2007), visitors were invited to shop at a convenience store stocked entirely with empty packages. But now, as CEO of MadeIn, the artist has both satirized and succumbed to the power of the market. It's a matter on which he is unapologetic. "I think all artists want their works to be sold, absolutely," he said. "The question is the precondition under which the works are sold.  "Xu Zhen Supermarket" (2016) The products inside the art installation are actually empty.    Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen . "It involves the questions: Are you willing to make an effort to cater to the market? What if the market happens to love your works or if the market won't love your works for another 20 years? Or what if no one loves your works?". Yet, despite this very conscious commercialization, Xu has continued to push the envelope. In "Small Change" (2011-2014), he produced 20 tanks from Chinese bank notes, arranging Mao's face at the firing end of each gun. And in a move reminiscent of his former pranks, MadeIn presented work by a group of anonymous Middle Eastern artists, only to reveal that they had been invented by Xu as commentary on cultural prejudice. MadeIn's fixation with the internet adds further credence to its founder's description of his work as being "of the zeitgeist." .  MadeIn Company produced the "Physique of Consciousness" video in 2011. The company describes it as "the first cultural fitness exercise" -- combining exercise movements with spiritual and cultural rituals.    Credit:  Madein Company/Xu Zhen . From distorted digital porn ads to collages made from pictures found online, Xu can add a body of internet-inspired artwork to two decades worth of paintings, photographs, sculptures and videos. "The most impactful event for me, was the rise of the internet (in) around 2000," he said. "As a tool, it changes how we understand our lives to a large extent. It changes knowledge and the relationship among individuals. "It's a huge, brand new theme for art creators. Five thousand years of human civilization has solidified our understanding of our culture and our self-recognition. Those ideas are rearranged in the internet era; something new is dug up.".  "Rainbow" is a three-minute film where Xu's back turns red, beaten by an unseen assailant.    Credit:  MadeIn Company/Xu Zhen . Yet, amid Xu's artistic evolution, it seems fitting that one of his earlier, more raw works will be on display at this month's "Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World" exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum. After all, it was "Rainbow" (1998), which depicts Xu's back slowly turning red as it is slapped by an unseen assailant, that introduced him to the world when it was screened at the Venice Biennale in 2001. "I think it's kind of brutal," he said. "It's very realistic and powerful." . Watch the video above for more of Xu Zhen's thoughts in his Shanghai-based studio. . Momo Moussa, Stephy Chung, Elliot deBruyn, CNN contributed to this report. .

VSenior officials have been told to exercise restraint not just at work but also at home, and have been directed to relieve all railway staff engaged as domestic help at home. Railways Board chairman Ashwani Lohani has been tasked with turning around the national carrier as it deals with a bad track record, both in safety and finances.(AFP\u2009File Photo). The railway ministry has asked its senior staff to slug it out \u2013 at home and at work \u2013 as part of steps to end the VIP culture in India\u2019s national transporter. In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol. In an order on September 28, the ministry said that the instructions and guidelines issued to the railways regarding the protocol to be observed at airports and railway stations during the visit of the Railway Board chairman and other board members stand withdrawn with immediate effect. Railway Board chairman Ashwani Lohani said no official will entertain bouquets and gifts at any time.  However, it\u2019s not just in the office that senior officials of the national carrier have to exercise restraint, but also at home. All senior officials have to relieve all the railway staff who have been engaged as domestic help in their homes. . Officials say that around 30,000 trackmen work at the homes of senior officials. They have been asked to resume duties. Sources in the ministry say that in the past one month around 6,000-7,000 personnel have reported back to work. \u201cNo one will be exempt from the directive to rejoin work except under very special circumstances. We are hoping that all the staff will join work shortly,\u201d a senior official of the ministry said. Railway minister Piyush Goyal has also asked senior officials to give up travelling in cosy saloons and executive class travel privileges and start travelling in sleeper and AC three-tier classes, mingling with other passengers.  These include members of the railway board, general managers of railway zones and divisional railway managers in each of the 50 divisions. . \u201cI believe that when these protocols were in place, people drafting them would have seen some reasoning behind them. It is difficult for me to say what they were though. However, now, these have no logic. \u201cAlso, there is a tendency in public organisations to not review protocols which have become archaic, but remain part of the dos and don\u2019ts for officials. They should be reviewed on a regular basis,\u201d said a former railway board member who didn\u2019t want to be quoted. .

VCalifornia state Assemblyman Ash Kalra (at podium) held a press conference Oct. 5 at San Jose State University, to herald the passage of a bill he authored, AB 21, which would protect the state\u2019s undocumented students. California Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill that morning. (photo courtesy of Ash Kalra\u2019s office). California Governor Jerry Brown Oct. 5 signed AB 21 \u2014 authored by Indian American state Assemblyman Ash Kalra \u2014 which would protect undocumented students from deportation as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ends. President Donald Trump ended the Obama-era initiative Sept. 5, calling on Congress to come up with legislation which would permanently protect undocumented youth from deportation. DACA \u2014 which offers relief from deportation, work permits, and drivers\u2019 licenses to about 800,000 young people, including an estimated 7, 218 Indian Americans \u2014 is scheduled to end March 5. Senate Republicans had introduced the SUCCEED Act Sept. 25, which would offer qualified undocumented youth a path to citizenship over a 15-year period. Kalra\u2019s bill \u2014 AB 21 \u2014 requires the University of California system, along with the California State University system, the state\u2019s community colleges, and private colleges that receive state funding to extend protections to students, faculty and staff who are undocumented and under threat of harassment or deportation. The bill also aims to ensure that DACA recipients continue to have access to financial aid, legal aid, and rights to due process. More than 4,000 students enrolled across the University of California\u2019s nine campuses are DACA recipients. About 10,000 students in the CSU system, and 61,000 students at California\u2019s community colleges are DACA recipients. A 2001 bill, AB 540, allows certain undocumented students in California to pay in-state tuition. \u201cI am so proud that our governor has signed Assembly Bill 21 into law and that he and our legislature continue to demonstrate California\u2019s leadership and stand against the tyranny of our current federal administration,\u201d said Kalra in a press statement. \u201cAB 21 defends the tradition and legacy of California\u2019s colleges and universities as beacons of free thought that challenge students in a peaceful and safe environment \u2014 where all students, regardless of their immigration status, may continue to take advantage of the education to which they are entitled, free from intimidation or risk of a loss of access to resources and programs that other students enjoy,\u201d said the assemblyman, who is serving his first term in the California state Legislature. The bill received bipartisan support in the California state Legislature, and also has the backing of all of the state\u2019s public university systems. \u201cToday's signings follow a series of actions by Governor Brown and his administration to bolster resources and support for the immigrant community,\u201d said Brown\u2019s office in a press statement, noting that the governor has previously signed the California Dream Act, which allows top students who are on the path to citizenship to apply for college financial aid. Brown has also signed legislation to help fund legal services for unaccompanied minors arriving in California from Central America as well as legal services to assist immigrants seeking naturalization and deportation defense. He has also signed legislation to extend health care coverage and other protections to undocumented children in the state.

VArtistes perform a traditional folk play. file photo. M Aamir Khan . Tribune News Service . A group of theatre artistes is rehearsing for a play \u2018Dandih Kaleh\u2019 (Donkey\u2019s Head) at the Cultural Academy\u2019s hall on the banks of the Jhelum river. The actors are very enthusiastic as the play is to be staged at Tagore Hall - the hub of cultural activities. . Even as festivals and events related to theatre have become common at the Tagore Hall now, artistes say a lot still needs to be done to fully revive the lost glory of theatre in the Valley that had taken a hit after the eruption of militancy over 27 years ago. . \u201cBefore 1989, there were so many groups here and theatre activities were at their peak. However, these suddenly came to a standstill. Theatre is now reviving to some extent but the government and corporate houses need to come forward in a big way to promote the culture,\u201d said veteran theatre artiste Farooq Sheikh. . He said they still had to knock at the doors of people for sponsorship and taking up theatre as a profession in the Valley was unthinkable. . \u201cProduction costs are high and we have to knock on people\u2019s doors for sponsorship. Whosoever is involved in theatre presently is only so because of his love for this art,\u201d he said. . Another well-known theatre/television actor Hassan Javaid echoed similar views. \u201cI have given my life to theatre but I always tell youngsters to keep other options ready as well. One cannot solely survive on theatre in Kashmir even though we are glad that Tagore Hall of late has hosted several theatre-related events where youngsters are getting a chance to showcase their talent,\u201d he said. . Despite nil monetary gain, youngsters are taking to theatre in a big way. Rayees Wathori (23), who had done a brief role in Salman Khan-starrer Bollywood movie \u2018Bajrangi Bhaijaan\u2019, is on job to revive \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019 \u2013 Kashmir valley\u2019s own folk theatre that is on the verge of extinction. . \u201cWe, a group of 15 youth from Budgam (in central Kashmir), have formed a group to revive \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019. There is no monetary gain but we hold \u2018Bhand Peather\u2019 shows only to keep our culture alive,\u201d he said. . Wathori, too, said the government needed to come forward in a big way so that theatre activities flourished in the Valley. .

VNew Delhi, Oct 9 () When India announced demonetisation last November, Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler described it as a "policy I have long supported" but also remarked "damn" when it was brought to his notice that the government was introducing Rs 2,000 currency notes. Thaler, a Professor of Economics and Behavorial Science at the University of Chicago, today won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is currently serving as Distinguished Service Professor of Finance, University of Chicago Booth School. Rajan, whose name was also doing the rounds for the Nobel Prize, recently stated that he was never in favour of demonetisation. In a tweet on November 8, 2016 -- along with a link to a news article about demonetisation -- Thaler said, "This is a policy I have long supported. First step toward cashless and good start on reducing corruption.". Soon after responding to comments that Rs 2,000 currency notes are to be introduced, Thaler tweeted, "really? Damn". These tweets came from the Twitter handle '@R_Thaler', which is not officially verified but was tagged by the official feed of the Nobel Prize. "BREAKING NEWS The 2017 Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to Richard H Thaler @R_Thaler @UChicago @ChicagoBooth #NobelPrize," the official twitter feed of the Nobel Prize tweeted today. On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as part of efforts to curb illicit fund flows and corruption. Thaler is the Charles R Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of Economics and Behavioral Science and Director of the Center for Decision Research, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences today said Thaler has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making.  "By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes," it said in a release while announcing him as the winner of the Nobel prize.

V Sluggish trend in soy oil continued on weak global cues and physical demand with soy refined quoted at \u20b9655-58 for 10 kg, while soy solvent declined to \u20b9622-25. Expected rise in festival demand ahead of Diwali may arrest downtrend in soy oil, said M Sanjay Agrawal, a soybean trader talking to the Business Line. .  Soybean traded lower on rise in arrival of new soybean in local mandis with its prices quoted at \u20b92,850 a quintal (down\u20b9150 from last week). Plant deliveries of soybean quoted lower at \u20b92,850 on slack demand in soy oil. Soy DOC ruled at \u20b922,000-23,500 a quintal. .

VWinky Lux has truly outdone itself. After winning us over with its viral color-changing jelly lipsticks and hosting the Unicorn Carnival of our dreams, the brand has now debuted an eye-shadow palette inspired by the only thing you love more than makeup: cats. . The Kitten Palette ($25), out today, features nine eye shadows that feel as velvety as a feline's fur. We got our hands on the new launch early and can confirm the shadows are kitten-soft to the touch but, even better, are superpigmented, creamy, and blendable. The palette has nine shades in four finishes: holographic, matte, satin, and glitter. The hues are a unique mix of both cool and warm tones with Fall-ready copper, brown, and cranberry right alongside shimmery chrome and iridescent lavender. On top of all that goodness, the packaging just begs for an Instagram. It's millennial pink with a floral print adorned with little cat heads. Too cute.

VNew Delhi [India], Oct 9 (ANI-NewsVoir): The outer wall of BR Ambedkar Memorial located next to Le Meridian Hotel in New Delhi, turned into a canvas to display one-of-a-kind Street Art Exhibition centered on a very grim issue of child trafficking. . The occasion dominated paintings based on panorama emanating from those avenues of our society which are considered bleak and dismal and where thousands of children trapped in the sex work industry are suffering in silence. The event was meant to draw attention to the apathy which these children are subjected to, after they are dragged into sex slavery. Apart from the keen visitors and the art enthusiasts, the occasion also witnessed keen participation from the survivors of child trafficking who unveiled 60 feet long street art to honor the journey of their lives. The thought provoking Street Art Exhibition received notable applauses and appreciation from the audience as it successfully highlighted a very pertinent issue of child trafficking that has plagued the Indian society at large. It is estimated that 40 percent of India's children are susceptible to threats like being homeless, trafficking, drug abuse, forced labour, and crime. As per data recorded by the Government of India, a large number of cases were registered under crimes against children during the last couple of years. However, despite the government's continued endeavors, the absence of a structured mechanism to link the efforts of various stakeholders and lack of convergence between ministries at the Central and State level, tends to impede enforcement against sex trafficking of children. The thought provoking Street Art Exhibition meant to draw attention of the community and the government on the issue of children trapped in the sex-work industry, was unveiled jointly by Delhi Street Art (an initiative to promote public art of young artists) and Jan Sahas Foundation.

VHighlights. Jio Payments Bank could launch in December, report says . Jio Payments Bank is a joint venture between Reliance Industries and SBI . Users only need an Aadhaar card to open an account with a payments bank. Reliance Industries may have plans to begin operations for the Jio Payments Bank before the year ends. Jio Payments Bank, which is a joint venture between Reliance Industries Limited and State Bank of India, will start its operations in December, Livemint reports. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, wanted to launch Jio Payments Bank alongside the shipment of JioPhone, which he unveiled in July, the report said. But the RBI asked Jio Payments Bank to demonstrate its capabilities, and prove that it is fully compliant with the regulations before the launch, a factor which the report cited as the reason for the delay. With the Jio Payments Bank, both Reliance Jio and SBI are eyeing last-mile customers, according to the report. Reliance Jio's network reaches several rural areas. Its JioPhone is also marketed to enrich the lives of people living in small towns and villages. According to the report, Reliance Jio is at present shipping the handset in remote areas, and will subsequently bring it to the urban markets. A person cited in the report said payments bank is not the core focus of Reliance Jio. Airtel was the first company to roll out its payments bank in India. The Payments Bank is an audacious project from the Indian government to bring banking and financial services to much of the population in the country. First unveiled in 2014, a payments bank will allow customers to avail several banking features such as performing transactions from their smartphone and without ever going to a physical bank. Anyone with an Aadhaar ID can open an account with a payments bank. According to UIDAI website, more than 1.18 billion people in India have been assigned with an Aadhaar card. SBI has over 400 million customers, while Reliance Jio has more than 120 million subscribers.

VRetail brands are using hotels to market products. Does it work?. You might not immediately think of a hotel as the most likely way to sell products, but retailers are excited about the possibilities of this unconventional, intriguing approach. But there are four methods retailers are using to get people who stay over to become more familiar with products. . 1. Making It Easier for Guests to Experience--Then Buy--Products. Many people balk at buying items for their homes because it's hard to envision whether the products they see on the shelves will be as fantastic during real-life use. That's probably why Restoration Hardware has been hard at work planning a 14-room hotel with a proposed rooftop deck and swimming pools. The company recently received planning permission for the property, which is located in a historic building within Manhattan's Meatpacking District. Restoration Hardware already has a section of its website devoted to hotel bedding, and it's filled with luxurious Italian linens. Going to a Restoration Hardware retail location and feeling the sheets is one thing, but sleeping on them for a few nights leaves no doubts about how great they feel. While staying in this planned hotel, guests could find furniture and other home accessories in their rooms that they can't wait to own. Then, thanks to a nearby Restoration Hardware retail location, they can quickly go and purchase items to enhance their abodes. 2. Giving a Platform to Emerging Artists. It's not uncommon for hotels to fill lobbies and rooms with artwork from local painters or photographers. However, the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin is taking that concept to a new level. Since it opened in the late 19th century, the hotel has been known for Victorian art and now has a permanent, 80-piece collection. It also boasts a forward-thinking artist-in-residence program that showcases the work of an artist and even allows guests to get customized pieces on the spot. Every year, the hotel welcomes a new creator who sets up his or her studio in the lobby. Currently, the lucky person is Margaret Muza. She offers tintype photography, a process that's even older than film. For $150, hotel guests can get self-portraits that Muza makes in about 15 minutes. This marketing plan is admirable for various reasons. It gives exposure to artists who otherwise may remain largely unknown to people outside the art world, and it's also a way for travelers to buy unique souvenirs from their stays. Plus, since the Pfister Hotel already has a background in art, this program strengthens that facet of the brand even more. . 3. Helping Guests Recreate One of the Best Parts of Their Hotel Experiences at Home. Many upscale hotel brands are enabling guests to focus on the importance of sleep by offering extravagant extras like in-room massages and foods to help them drift off to dreamland. These amenities allow properties to charge significantly higher rates for rooms with specialized beds and other sleep-related perks. Some hoteliers have even started selling the beds used in the rooms so guests can get the same restful nights of sleep they enjoy at a luxurious hotel throughout the rest of the year. The Four Seasons hotel chain is one example of a brand that's taking this approach. It has partnered with Simmons to offer exclusive mattresses complete with toppers and opulent sheets. 4. Promoting an Active Lifestyle for Guests on the Go. Many health-conscious travelers moan about having to disrupt their gym regimens when they're away from home. However, because well-known fitness brand Equinox has recently branched out into the hospitality industry, customers can soon enjoy top-notch hotel experiences that keep them fit. Equinox plans to open its first hotel in Manhattan's Hudson Yards district by 2019 with another one getting established in Chicago afterward. According to Equinox marketing executive Carlos Becil, the market is ripe for a smooth pairing of a fitness brand and place to stay. He notes that 95% of people polled said they would like to book rooms in an Equinox branded property. Consider that those people were already familiar with Equinox and knew what the brand entails. However, Equinox is expanding its gym locations, and hotels could add momentum to that process. Anyone can stay at the Equinox hotels, but people who go to the brand's fitness centers and are members there get special privileges. If non-members are particularly impressed by the quality and amenities offered within their hotel stays, they could realize there is no better time to make good on the promises to start working out more often. These case studies prove that using hotels as product-selling platforms is a smart idea indeed. People already crave immersive accommodation options that let them escape everyday routines for a while. This kind of branding is an intelligent extension of that reality. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

V The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) has announced its collaboration with acclaimed artist Seema Kohli for the spring-summer edition of Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW) 2018.  Kohli has conceptualized an installation titled "Tatvamasi- The Other Self" derived from Vedic beej mantra. It expresses the basic concept of seeing one's own self in the other. As an artist, she felt the need to initiate harmony through different mediums of art. .  "I'm delighted to showcase my work Tatvamasi at a prestigious platform like Amazon India Fashion Week. This is a landmark edition for FDCI and since the theme of this season is celebration, I feel in today's social scenario it is imperative that we celebrate ourselves in another and reflect oneself in another to create an interpersonal feeling of oneness and inclusiveness. .

VWhat 'rapid intensification' means for storms.  (CNN)Yet another tropical storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean on Monday, the 15th named storm of what has been an active and destructive hurricane season. . So far, though, Tropical Storm Ophelia doesn't appear to post the same threats to battered islands and coastlines as posed by Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria. "Forecasts currently show that Ophelia is not a threat to land," CNN meteorologist Judson Jones said. The new storm formed in the open Atlantic from Tropical Depression Seventeen, the National Hurricane Center said in its 11 a.m. advisory. The tropical storm is carrying 40 mph winds and is located about 860 miles west-southwest of the Azores Islands, the center said. The current forecast calls for Ophelia to strengthen gradually during the week as it drifts toward the east and become a hurricane on Friday, which would make it the 10th hurricane of the 2017 season. . Most active season since 2005, the year of Katrina. This season is the most active since the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the year Katrina struck New Orleans and Mississippi. That year there were 28 named storms, of which 15 were hurricanes. Of the named storms this year, 9 have been hurricanes and five turned into major hurricanes of Category 3 or more, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Varian said. With nine consecutive named storms becoming hurricanes already this year, it would take just two more to break the record of 10 set in 1878 and matched in 1886 and 1893, Varian said. The most recent hurricane, Nate, killed 28 people in Central America and slammed the US Gulf Coast over the weekend, causing heavy rains and flooding. It has been downgraded to a tropical depression. "The peak of the hurricane season is the first or second week of September, but it's not over till the end of November. October is usually active and there could be a few more named storms," Varian said. CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.

VI\u2019ve heard a lot of incredible survival stories from those who lived through the recent bout of hurricanes all across the country, but the story of this baby girl riding out not just one but two major tropical storms just might take the cake!. Little Gabriella Coane is less than 1 month old, but she\u2019s already lived through quite an ordeal. Mom Jessica gave birth on August 20, 2017, only 1 week before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and caused massive devastation. Jessica and her husband, Bruce, live in Houston and decided to ride out the storm in their apartment in the city after Gabriella was born. But when they found out that nearby chemical plants might have been impacted by the storm, they made the decision to flee \u2014 to their second home in Miami. According to PEOPLE, Bruce and Jessica took a roundabout 1,200-mile-long route in order to avoid Harvey as they drove from Texas to their Florida home. That\u2019s over 20 hours of driving!. \u201cShe crossed 5 states during the first 2 weeks of her life,\u201d Bruce said of baby Gabriella. When they heard that Hurricane Irma was now heading their way, the family initially wanted to stay and ride that storm out as well. But friends convinced them to once more evacuate, so they found a hotel that could accommodate them \u2014 several more hours away in a small Alabama town. This baby has done more traveling by car in her few weeks of living than most people do in a whole year! What are the odds of being born just in time to experience two major natural disasters? Thank goodness the Coane family all made it out safely. Footage provided by KHOU Houston. If you\u2019re looking to help the victims of the recent hurricanes, consider donating to the Red Cross, or take a look at these eight ways you can lend a hand.

VEvery single line item in our entire Bernie Madoff scam of a system is cooked. My theme this week is The Great Unraveling, by which I mean the unraveling of our social-political-economic system of hierarchical, centralized power. Let's start by looking at how the basis of governance has transmogrified from consent of the governed to consent of the conned. In effect, our leadership leads by lying. As we know, when it gets serious, you have to lie to preserve the perquisites and power of those atop the wealth-power pyramid, and well, it's serious all the time now, so lies are the default setting of the entire status quo. But all too many of us are willing to accept the lies because they're what we want to hear. As any competent con-man knows, you can only con those who want to be conned. You can only scam the marks who want to believe that what's obviously too good to be true is in fact true. The story of scams such as Bernie Madoff's isn't that canny Bernie victimized helpless wealthy people; the untold story is that all those "victims" wanted to believe that something that was obviously too good to be true--incredibly high returns, logged month after month and year after year like clockwork--was in fact true because their greed made them more than just vulnerable to being scammed--they wanted to be bamboozled by Bernie. Victims of scams naturally deny their own culpability. It's extremely uncomfortable to admit that greed didn't just blind us to a patently impossible yield; we wanted to be conned because it felt so wonderful to believe we richly deserved unearned wealth. All wealth is "earned" to those doing the skimming. The greatest con machine of all time, Wall Street, judiciously refers to every skim and scam as "earnings.". And so the "victims" blame our lying leaders for telling them what they want to hear. You see how the webs of self-interest reinforce each other: those atop the wealth-power pyramid secure their position by lying persuasively enough to gain The Consent of the Conned--those who give their consent to a visibly corrupt and unsustainable status quo because that status quo is promising to provide too good to be true goodies. In other words, the lies are constantly compounding: the leadership lies to themselves-- we have to lie to keep everything glued together for the good of the people--when their real motivation is to keep the system glued together because the system gives them wealth and power. If we can be honest for a moment, we might admit that representational democracy encourages leaders to issue too good to be true promises because those promises win votes. Those on the bottom of the wealth-power pyramid accept the too good to be true assurances because that's exactly want we want to hear: that we all deserve a piece of the unearned wealth that, like Bernie Madoff's painfully impossible scam, flows in permanent abundance via some sort of financial magic. The books are cooked, people; we embrace a gigantic too good to be true Bernie Madoff scam of a system because it's what we want to believe and what we want to hear. Then, when the whole phantom-wealth con collapses in a heap, we quickly pull on the tattered cloak of victimhood: we were promised, we were lied to, we trusted our leaders to lead us wisely, and so on, as if the con wasn't obvious to anyone who was skeptical of too good to be true claims. Now that the whole Bernie Madoff scam of a system is unraveling, two self-reinforcing dynamics are in play: our leadership, elected and unelected alike, are doubling down on the lies because there is no alternative--TINA. What does a liar gain by confessing the whole prosperity thing is illusory, and darn it, we can only spend what we produce in real-world surplus? Short answer: nothing, because that's not going to win elections or gain the consent of the governed. So lies are piled on lies to the point of absurdity. But just as Bernie Madoff's wealthy marks ignored the warnings of the skeptical and mounting evidence that they were being conned, the electorate wants to believe the magical thinking is real, and so they accept the latest statistical flim-flammery as "proof" that the con is not a con. Once again, we worship the Goddess TINA--there is no alternative. Just as our leaders are now trapped in their web of lies and false assurances, the governed are also trapped in the con because it's too painful and unnerving to admit we've willingly bought into a complete con: we're too smart to be conned, we protest; look, it's not a con, the GDP is growing and unemployment is low--and so on. Bernie Madoff's marks made the same defensive protests: it can't be a con, look at my statement: the monthly "earnings" keep pouring in. The books are cooked, folks, at every level of our Bernie Madoff scam of a system: the federal books are cooked; state, county and city books are cooked; corporate books are cooked; the statistical metrics are all cooked; the projections are cooked, and the estimates are cooked. Every single line item in our entire Bernie Madoff scam of a system is cooked. Wanting to believe a con is true doesn't make it true. The power of a con rests in our great desire to believe that what's too good to be true is magically true. It isn't, but it feel so reassuring and, well, deserved for it to be true. It's tempting to blame our leadership for perpetrating this systemic con, but every con requires marks who are willing to accept that what's too good to be true is magically true. * * *.

VGuest post by Paul A. Miller. As a folk historian and facilitator with Legacy Chronicles Life Stories, it should come as no surprise that I believe in the value of securing and sharing these precious memories of our loved ones. I am convinced family storytelling can bring together generations, restoring and strengthening relationships while educating each of us about our own backgrounds. Family stories help us understand where we come from and who we are. But can family storytelling also improve mental health?. I\u2019m not a mental health expert; nevertheless, from my experience, I believe so. Here are four ways sharing family stories can promote a healthy mind in both the teller and the listener. Identity. Identity has become a buzzword in America\u2019s political battlegrounds, but this concept is basic to a person\u2019s mental health. We grow and maintain healthy relationships with others when reaching out from a place of understanding who we are as individuals. Storytelling fosters construction of identity in two ways. For the storyteller, expressing those memories affords an opportunity to create a unique style and character. The stories themselves often portray the teller as the protagonist, and the teller narrates his or her own drama which re-enforces specific aspects of that identity. The listeners learn and engage with parts of their familial background, providing additional material to be used in constructing their own identities. I personally found this to be the case when my father told me the story of his childhood. Though a third-generation American, as a child his family spoke German almost exclusively. For me, an appreciation for the challenges of immigrant families and non-English speakers is more than a policy choice or a moral imperative, it is part of the background of who I am. It is part of my self-identity. Direction. As each of us looks back over our experiences, we inevitably see commonalities. We connect the dots. We formulate a vector for our life. One gentleman I recorded had overcome two major challenges in life: addiction and a debilitating accident which cost him two limbs. In his storytelling, these major events, either of which he could have blamed for derailing hope for a happy life, instead became segments of highway on a road which is leading somewhere. They give him direction and point to a purpose which he now actively pursues. An audience can also find direction in the example of the storyteller. Life can seem a little random sometimes \u2013 at least mine can! Experiencing the wisdom of our loved ones through stories can open up new ways to interpret our complicated lives, ways which may point toward opportunities we had not considered. We feel peace with purpose, and our mental outlook improves. Community. Among the great tragedies of our day is the pervasive loneliness in society. Although our technology connects us in ways never dreamed of even 50 years ago, that same technology separates us from human contact. I may learn of the activities of a friend on the West Coast in great detail, but I can\u2019t shake his hand or look him in the eye. I may tweet back and forth with my cousin, but we still don\u2019t actually meet and talk. The human element is fading from our communications, and with it, our sense of mutuality and relationship. When close friends or family members come together, they inevitably tell stories \u2013 stories about their work, their pastimes, their activities, their friends, their challenges. They draw a portrait of who they are in their story selection, in their speaking style and in the details they provide. The teller receives the gift of self-expression, which affirms individual value even as it includes the teller in a wider community with the audience. The listeners receive a gift as well: understanding. Even when the story is challenging or boring \u2013 even when it makes no sense \u2013 the story is educating the audience about this person whom they care about, uniting them as humans. They may be of different opinions and outlooks, but teller and audience are united as a community in the storytelling setting. In a recording session I held recently, two siblings remembered a story in substantially different fashion. They contradicted each other on several points, argued a bit about who was right \u2013 then allowed each other to finish the story in their own way. United as tellers and audience, they felt an obligation to mutual respect in the presentation and reception of the story, told separately. In the end, they laughed together over faulty memories! The sense of community was maintained. Shared Stories, Healthy Minds. We are social animals. Our relationships largely define how we look at ourselves and how we react to the challenges of life. We are storytellers. The anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson has said, \u201cThe human species thinks through metaphors and learns through stories.\u201d We use stories to pass on vital information, not only on facts and figures but in concepts, in art, in ethics, and in truth. We are an audience. We cannot help but listen in on a good story. We spend billions of dollars entertaining ourselves with stories in movies, television programs, plays, and books. My grandfather lived a large and exciting life. Farmer, brewer, policeman, restaurateur, liquor control agent \u2013 he did it all. He traded in Cadillacs, snowmobiles, and horses. He nearly blew up his garage more than once. He was a fireworks-shooting, cigar-smoking fisherman extraordinaire. And while people often remember his various careers, his trading ventures or his highly-colorful language, what they generally recall most are his stories. People still smile and laugh when they hear I am Woody Tuohy\u2019s grandson. To put it simply, his stories brought people joy, and he enjoyed telling them. Immerse yourself in the stories of your loved ones. Tell a few stories yourself. Include the younger members of your family in this celebration of our humanity. It can\u2019t help but improve your outlook on life.

VExecutive Summary. Scientific studies have long suggested that investing in the right people will maximize organizations\u2019 returns. In a world of unlimited resources, organizations would surely invest in everyone.In the real world, however, limited budgets force organizations to be much more selective, which explains the growing interest in high potential (HiPo) identification. If we are going to invest in the right employees, how do we find them? What are the key indicators that signal star potential? Research points to three general markers of high potential: 1.) ability (Is the individual able to do the job in question?); 2.) social skills (Can this person establish and maintain cooperative working relationships); and 3.) drive (is this person motivated to work hard, achieve, and do whatever it takes to get the job done?). Most organizations could probably upgrade their talent identification processes if they keep things simple and focus on these three generic markers of potential. Investing in these individuals will produce the highest ROI for your company. How inclusive or exclusive should organizations be when developing their employees\u2019 talents? In a world of unlimited resources, organizations would surely invest in everyone. After all, as Henry Ford is credited as saying, \u201cthe only thing worse than training your employees and having them leave is not training them and having them stay.\u201d In the real world, however, limited budgets force organizations to be much more selective, which explains the growing interest in high potential (HiPo) identification. An employee\u2019s potential sets the upper limits of his or her development range \u2014 the more potential they have, the quicker and cheaper it is to develop them. Scientific studies have long suggested that investing in the right people will maximize organizations\u2019 returns. In line with Pareto\u2019s principle, these studies show that across a wide range of tasks, industries, and organizations, a small proportion of the workforce tends to drive a large proportion of organizational results, such that:. the top 1% accounts for 10% of organizational output. the top 5% accounts for 25%, of organizational output. the top 20% accounts for 80% of organizational output. Careful research over many jobs and across many organizations in multiple industries highlights a clear pattern: the payoff from employing top talent \u2014 defined as the vital few who account for the biggest chunk of organizational output \u2014 increases as a function of job complexity. For less complex jobs, like manufacturing, top employees outperform average employees by a median margin of about 50%. However, for medium complexity jobs, such as trainers or first line sales managers, that difference grows to 85-100%, and for highly complex jobs, such as senior leadership roles, the contribution of top performers is more than double that of the average performer. It is also noteworthy that talented employees are \u201cforce multipliers\u201d, raising the performance bar for their colleagues, and particularly for their direct reports. By word and deed, they model and teach winning behaviors that shape high-performing cultures. Simply adding a star performer to a team boosts the effectiveness of other team members by 5-15%. No wonder, then, that study after study shows stronger financial performance in companies that make proportionally greater investments in identifying and developing top talent. If we are going to invest in the right employees, the key question concerns who they actually are. This begs the question of what highly talented people are like. In other words, what are the key indicators that signal star potential?. As academic reviews noted, the first and most important decision that needs to be made in this regard is to decide \u201cpotential for what?\u201d Unfortunately, most HiPo interventions focus on individual career success \u2014 \u201cpotential to move up two roles in five years\u201d is a common definition \u2014 but the ability to advance one\u2019s own career does not guarantee that one will make a crucial contribution to the organization. In fact, most organizational leaders \u2014 and it would be hard to argue that these people have not attained individual success, since they got to the top \u2014 don\u2019t have a positive impact on their teams and organizations, with estimates suggesting that at least 1 in 2 leaders cannot engage employees and fail to turn their teams or organizations into high performing machines. Indeed, there is no shortage of leaders who turn A-players into a B-team. In our view, HiPo interventions should focus on predicting who is likely to become a key driver of organizational performance. That is, they should define future stars as the people who will \u201cconsistently generate exorbitant output levels that influence the success or failure of their organizations.\u2019\u2019 Fortunately, science reveals that regardless of the context, job, and industry, such individuals tend to share a range of measurable qualities, which can be identified fairly early in the process. In a review that compared scientific research on predictors of job performance to the qualities in highest demand for the 21st century workforce, we identified three general markers of high potential. Ability. The first category concerns indications that an individual is able to do the job in question. The best leading indicator here is demonstrating the knowledge and skill it takes to perform the key tasks that make up the job. The single-best predictor of job performance is a work sample test \u2014 where you observe the candidate actually performing the tasks that make up the job. However, in forecasting potential to excel in a bigger, more complex job at some point in the future, the question shifts to how likely an individual is to be able to learn and master the requisite knowledge and skill. The single-best predictor of this is IQ or cognitive ability. Learning ability includes a substantial cognitive component but also the motivation to pick up new knowledge and skills fast and flexibly. Any role requires abilities beyond cognitive ability. For instance, potential for performing in a leadership role at the executive level requires strategic thinking and the ability to adapt an organization for the long-term future. In addition to raw intellectual horse power, this involves vision and imagination, as well as an entrepreneurial mindset. Thus early indicators of the ability for senior organizational leadership would also include creativity and a knack for systems thinking. Social skills. The next big category reflects the growing significance of team work and collaboration in modern organizations. At a basic level, employees have to be able to get along and earn the support of supervisors and coworkers. Indeed, the number one reason for managerial derailment is relationships problems. Social skills involve two fundamental abilities: the ability to manage yourself and the ability to manage others (relationships). Employees likely to succeed in bigger, more complex jobs are first able to manage themselves \u2014 to handle increased pressure, deal constructively with adversity, and act with dignity and integrity. Secondly, they are able to establish and maintain cooperative working relationships, build a broad network of contacts and form alliances, and be influential and persuasive with a range of different stakeholders. And for senior roles, they have to be able to develop sophisticated political skills \u2014 the ability to read an audience, decode the unspoken rules, and find solutions that satisfy the often competing interests of key power brokers. The ability to manage oneself and to manage others are the core elements of emotional intelligence. So an early indicator of high potential is emotional intelligence, which can be assessed by psychometric tests and further refined through training and development. Drive. The third category concerns the will and motivation to work hard, achieve, and do whatever it takes to get the job done. It is easily identified as work ethic and ambition \u2014 an ability to remain dissatisfied with one\u2019s achievements. This deeply motivational category is the accelerator that multiplies the potential influence of ability and social skills on future success. Ability and social skill may be considered talent; but potential is talent multiplied by drive as this will determine how much ability and social skills get put to use. Drive can be assessed by standardized tests that measure conscientiousness, achievement motivation, and ambition. It can also be identified behaviorally \u2014 as signaled by how hard an individual works, willingness to take on extra duties and assignments, eagerness for more responsibility, and even readiness to sacrifice. For instance, many executive-level roles require a global mindset and some degree of cross-cultural experience. The willingness to embrace a degree of psychological and even physical discomfort and relocate in order to gain the experience and develop these skills separates talented individuals from true high potentials. In sum, most organizations could probably upgrade their talent identification processes if they keep things simple and focus on these three generic markers of potential. Not many employees are highly able, socially skilled, and driven \u2014 but if you bet on those who are, which involves evaluating these qualities as accurately as you can, you will end up with a higher proportion of future stars who will contribute disproportionately to the organization. Investing in those individuals will produce the highest ROI.

VIf you work away from the home, you may be looking for dogs who can be left alone \u2014 at least while you\u2019re at the office. First, remember that dogs are social animals. Dog parents who work away from home still need to prioritize time for their dogs\u2019 daily mental and physical exercise and interaction. Secondly, 9 to 5 owners do well to choose breeds that manage solo hours without undue boredom, stress, gloom or destruction. Let\u2019s hear from five self-proclaimed dogs who can be left alone for a reasonable amount of time without serious separation anxiety:. The Pekingese is a pretty independent dog breed. Photography courtesy Dian Thomas. Developed long ago in China, we were favored Imperial companions. At times carried in our owners\u2019 sleeves, we were bred in diverse colors to coordinate with wardrobes. Today, you needn\u2019t carry me often. I\u2019m sturdier than many toy breeds, and I appreciate walks and outings. And while I love family time, I don\u2019t commonly languish when you\u2019re working. I\u2019m naturally inclined to put my paws up, so a relaxing day suits me. If your house and heart can accommodate two Pekes, however, we\u2019ll enjoy the company. And if you have a safe environment for me to move from indoors to outdoors, I\u2019d appreciate a doggie door. We\u2019re a self-determining breed. Of course, we want to come and go as we please!. Greyhounds are content to curl up on the couch when you\u2019re not home. Photography courtesy Cyndi Swanson. An ancient breed famous for extraordinary speed, we also excel in relaxing on your couch. We\u2019re affectionate, easy keepers. We do, however, need a chance to run in a fenced area since we instinctively chase moving creatures. Many of us are retired racing Greyhounds who are hopeful for home life. With training and love, we transform from racers to relaxed buddies. Whether bred for racing or companionship, it\u2019s quite remarkable how adaptable and easygoing we are in homes. Did I mention we have thin skin and little fat? We like your soft, cushy furniture better than the floor!. Great Pyrenees. Photography via Shutterstock. Used for centuries in southwestern Europe\u2019s mountainous areas, I was bred as a sheep guardian dog. I often protected sheep alone, which explains my occasional skepticism about human commands. Though reserved with strangers, I take good care of my family. I also don\u2019t insist on endless sports or activities. In fact, although I\u2019m serious about my watchdog work, I like to simply nap with one eye open. Don\u2019t let my large size fool you \u2014 I can jump to attention quickly if needed. I expect daily exercise, but I\u2019m relatively calm indoors. All bets are off, though, if you leave me outside. I may bark at each new happening. And when you get home from work, I\u2019ll want to walk with you, lean on you (yes, we do that!) and hang out with you. Alaskan Malamutes definitely need attention \u2014 but they don\u2019t nag! Photography courtesy Beth Dulea. We\u2019re the biggest Arctic sled dog, bred to haul heavy loads for Inuit tribes. We worked hard for man, often using our own judgment to assess ice conditions and determine safe routes. These days, we welcome time with you but we demonstrate a self-ruling spirit. We\u2019re deemed playful upon invitation \u2014 that means we don\u2019t endlessly nag for attention. We do thrive on outdoor exercise. May I suggest an extra outing on weekends, such as sledding or hiking? On workdays, if I have a walk or a romp before you leave, I\u2019ll likely doze until dinner. Caveat: if you\u2019re gone too long (or forget to walk us!), we may howl our disapproval. Sealyham Terriers aren\u2019t an overly demanding breed. Photography courtesy Sandy Schneider. We\u2019re inquisitive and self-confident, but not overly demanding. We were developed in Wales for hunting, following our prey even underground. My forefathers were bred by Captain John Tucker-Edwardes to hunt fox, rats, badgers and rabbits. In time, our companionship was as valued as our work. We shared our lives with Hollywood celebrities such as Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart. Today, we\u2019re a comparatively rare breed, eager to bond with families. We expect walks, attention and chances to explore our worlds, but when we\u2019re indoors we\u2019re relatively calm. Now, for weekends, may I suggest a Barn Hunt?.

VBitcoin continues to march back towards its record highs, breaking back above $4600 for the first time since September 8th. So what will it take for the digital currency to get back to record highs above $5000 and beyond?. Forbes' Panos Mourdoukoutas offers several possible catalysts... The return of buzz, which will bring buyers back to the market. And that will take a catalyst, like the rollback of China\u2019s ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which killed Bitcoin\u2019s buzz in the first place. The ban may be temporary, to appease international agencies and hardcore communist members ahead of the upcoming Communist Party convention, as written in a previous piece here. Another catalyst could be a financial crisis which could make Bitcoin the \u201csafe heaven\u201d asset, as investors flee financial assets. Like the 2008-9 financial crisis that extended across almost every asset category. Or a sovereign debt crisis. Then there\u2019s the prospect of a regional war, beginning either in North Korea or the South China Sea, which would disrupt global trade; or in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia and Iran are moving closer to an open war. And there\u2019s the prospect of an endorsement by a major Wall Street institution, which wouled increase awareness among investors, helping the demand for Bitcoin cross the \u201ctipping point\u201d and reach cascade. How likely is it that any of these catalysts will materialize? They are all likely, but it takes time. The Chinese Communist Party Convention, for instance, will be over at the end of this month. This means that the first catalyst may materialize soon after. Time may get close for the second catalyst, as financial markets undergo a crisis, every 8-10 years; and eight years have already lapsed since the last crisis. As of the other two catalysts, it\u2019s hard to set a time. That\u2019s why investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should take a longer view on placing their bets on the digital currency, always keeping in mind that Bitcoin is an alternative to national currencies, and the \u201cnew gold,\u201d a hedge against global uncertainty. These views come just days after American tech billionaire investor and television personality Mark Cuban recently claimed that he sees Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the way of the future. As CoinTelegraph.com reports, he also countered the various claims that the leading digital currency is not real and has no intrinsic value. In an interview with Bloomberg, the renowned American businessman claimed that Bitcoin is just like the traditional stocks that investors can buy and sell. \u201c...it's interesting because I think there are a lot of assets that have values based on just supply and demand. You know, most stocks, they don't have any intrinsic value, no true ownership rights, no voting rights, you just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. They're like baseball cards and I think Bitcoin is the same thing...\u201d. Cuban also said that he has been looking to buy into Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market ever since and he confirmed that he already invested in the leading digital currency, as well as some initial coin offerings (ICO). \u201c...I have bought some, bought it through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange because that gave me liquidity. I am also involved with ICOs, actually token sales, because I think Blockchain is a great platform for future applications...\u201d. His most recent statements are quite far from his previous perception as he earlier called Bitcoin as \u2018bubble\u2019. His company\u2019s recent moves, however, seem to be bullish of cryptocurrencies as his team have been investing in ICOs and Blockchain projects.

VBeijing, China \u2013 A senior official of China forestry regulatory body says governments of African countries should make common efforts in regulating Chinese companies operating in their respective forestry and extractive sectors to limit illegal wildlife trade or environmental degradation. Report by Alpha Daffae Senkpeni - This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. Wang Chunfeng, Deputy Director General for the Department of International Cooperation of the State Forestry Administration (SFA) of China, said in order to compliment the significant strides China has made in curbing illegal wildlife trade or environmental degradation, African countries must put in place stringent regulations. \u201cThe country where our Chinese companies have investments should strengthen their regulations and give more information about the company to our government,\u201d Wang said in Beijing on September 26. \u201cAnd our government will be strict and regulate that company based on information about Chinese firms in Africa are communicated to our country.\u201d. He also called on African countries to take actions to punish Chinese firms accused of illegal wildlife or environmental degradation, while also encouraging governments to ensure logging are done at a sustainable level. China has already imposed several regulations for firms investing in Africa\u2019s extractive sector, he said. Some of these regulations encourage Chinese oversea firms to uphold \u201cGreen standard\u201d before acquiring loans from a Chinese bank. This means, companies operating outside China must consider the protection of the environment and respect the local people, Wang said. He said relevant Chinese government agencies have also created a \u2018blacklist\u2019 of companies involve with illegal activities. \u201cSince the start of this year, Chinese government has started reviewing regulations for oversea companies and have started drawing new regulations,\u201d Wang said, adding that the new measures will help improve an \u201cecological friendly environment\u201d. According to the SFA, Chinese government has improved its cooperation with Africa in wildlife conservation providing technical and material support to several African countries\u2019 natural conservation initiatives in order to help combat illegal activities. Premier Li Keqiang, in 2014, as support to Africa\u2019s wildlife conservation initiative announced material and technical support worth US$10 million. There have also been frequent exchanges of knowledge and experience between the continent and China in dealing with the problem, the SFA said. China currently has bilateral agreements with Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, providing support to the three countries in enhancing their respective wildlife law enforcement. SFA however encouraged African countries opting to broaden their cooperation on dealing with wildlife conservation issues to make request to the Chinese government for extended partnership. In December 2016, China announced that it would shut down carving factories in the country before the end of 2017 \u2013 a move expected to massively curb poaching or the killing of elephants in Africa. The country has also made amendments in its conservation laws especially on the purchase of illegal wildlife. The law provides severe punishment for citizens involve with smuggling or criminally purchasing wildlife. China\u2019s legal framework to protect its natural reserve started back in the 1950s when the country put into law a policy which now sees the preservation of 147 million hectares of land covering all kinds of natural reserve. Already, China has launched rigid law enforcement actions for the monitoring of ports, railways, markets and also checking the Internet for illegal trades. Once there\u2019s suspected activity, actions are taken, the SFA said. \u201cTech company has a role, we track to locate, find and stop illegal trade online,\u201d said Wang Li, Tencent public relations manager. \u201cWe have shut down a lot and make their trafficking difficult.\u201d. Li told African journalists in Beijing that online trafficking has dropped in China. . Data from the SFA shows a significant decrease in illegal wildlife activities in China, although curbing the trade in Africa remains a challenge.

VPhotograph: Courtesy Geffen Playhouse. Actor Arye Gross first graced the Geffen Playhouse stage in 2012, when he portrayed the idealized but endearingly real father, Mr. Abramowitz, in the premiere of Donald Margulies\u2019s Coney Island Christmas. The performance was a thrilling experience for Gross, who in his teen years lived in Westwood and claims to have loitered in the Scandinavian furniture store that once occupied what is now the theater\u2019s lobby. Gross is one of those actors you may not know by name but would certainly recognize. He first appeared in films such as Soul Man and Tequila Sunrise in the 1980s, and played Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s roommate on Ellen,.  with later recurring roles in Castle and Six Feet Under. In the theater world, he\u2019s one of the most familiar and universally admired actors on Los Angeles stages. Audiences know him from South Coast Repertory\u2019s rendition of Our Mother\u2019s Brief Affair,as the articulate but puzzled son; his part as the gently agonized title role in Antaeus Theatre Company\u2019s Uncle Vanya; and his turn as the heavy-handed editor in Pasadena Playhouse\u2019s Above the Fold. Though his list of theater and television credits may be long, Gross performs alone onstage for the first time in his career when he returns to the Geffen this fall in the Playhouse\u2019s production of Glen Berger\u2019s Underneath the Lintel. Berger wrote this solo play, which bears the subtitle An Impressive Presentation of Lovely Evidences, more than 17 years ago. The Actors\u2019 Gang premiered it in 2001, and since then it\u2019s traveled the nation. Now, at long last, director Steven Robman has delivered the script into the hands of the actor who may serve it best. . Arye Gross. Gross plays a librarian living in a small town in the Netherlands, who becomes consumed with the story behind a book that\u2019s 113 years overdue and suddenly is returned in the library\u2019s overnight slot. \u201cHe cannot just let that go,\u201d says Gross. \u201cHe\u2019s got to find out who returned it and who checked it out.\u201d The librarian engages in rhetorical conversation with the audience about his attempts to discover the book\u2019s history and whether to continue onward\u2014though Gross says he hopes the audience doesn\u2019t answer back, which he worries would require him to be clever on his feet. Though many of us may have difficulty recalling the last time we checked a book out of a library, Gross remembers. He checked it out for this play: a tome about 18th-century English landscape painter Joseph Wright of Derby, whose work factors into the librarian\u2019s historical scavenger hunt. \u201cThe situation that faces the librarian is that, in order to follow the most miraculous thing that\u2019s ever happened in his life, he has to give up everything,\u201d says Gross. \u201cAnd the evening has to do with his dilemma.\u201d When asked if Gross would be inclined to follow his character\u2019s path, he pauses and says with a smile, \u201cthat is the question.\u201d. Underneath the Lintel is at Geffen Playhouse Tue\u2013Sun at various times from Oct 10 through Nov 19 (geffenplayhouse.com). $60\u2013$80. .

VThe beauty segment of the market is undergoing a humongous change. The growing concern of consumers regarding the use of unnatural chemical ingredients has led to a demand for organic products. This trend is driven by the increasing awareness of the ill-effects of various chemicals which are used in the manufacturing of cosmetics. These ingredients cause a lot of health issues to its users. Cosmetic companies use these chemicals as they increase the effectiveness of their products and are also cheaper to source. Some ingredients used are known to be cancerous and some are labelled not unsuitable for humans.This has led to an increasein demand for natural products. Natural products are safe and without any side effects. More people are realising the goodness of natural products and switching to it. Anything which is labelled 'organic' or 'natural' is fast selling and manufacturers are cashing in on the trend. While some products may genuinely be derived from nature, not all natural or organic products are totally free from chemicals. Therefore, one needs to be too careful in reading the fine print. Almost everything that we use today contains harmful chemicals. Your everyday things like soaps and shampoos can be made at home, that too with ingredients easily available in your kitchen. Our shampoos and soaps contain surfactants which dry our skin and hair. The face wash we use actually causes damage to the delicate layers of the skin. When the skin is dry, you'll observe early signs of ageing. Therefore, the best way to stay away from these chemicals is to use natural or better still, home-made products. Using natural products for our personal care will reduce the damage and help maintain our skin health. Your face wash is a product that you use almost everyday. Why not switch it with a natural home-made product and see the difference it makes on your skin? This article will tell you about recipes for making a home-made cleanser which will clean your skin and make it soft and supple. It will restore the natural pH balance of the skin and give it a glow. Here are different home-made facial cleansers for different skin types. 1) Home-made Facial Cleanser For Normal Skin.  You can get away with anything on normal skin. Here is an easy recipe of a home-made facial cleanser for normal skin. Chamomile Facial Cleanser.  Ingredients:.  1) 1/4 cup baby wash (or any other mild liquid soap).  2) 1/4 cup chamomile tea.  3) 3/4 teaspoon olive oil.  4) 3 capsules vitamin E. Method:.  1) Take a soap dispenser and make sure it is empty and dry.  2) Add the baby wash to it.  3) Now, add the chamomile tea and olive oil.  4) Cut the Vitamin E capsules and add them to the mixture.  5) Mix all the ingredients and close the bottle.  6) Use this cleanser to wash your face everyday. 2) Home-made Facial Cleanser For Dry Skin.  Dry skin needs extra moisture. Regular facewashes strip away the natural oils of the skin. Here is a refreshing lavender and rose cleanser to restore the skin's moisture levels. Lavender And Rose Facial Foaming Cleanser.  Ingredients:.  1) 1/4 cup baby wash.  2) 4-5 tablespoons rose water.  4)2-3 drops lavender essential oil. Method:.  1) Mix all the above ingredients one by one in a dispenser.  2) Close the bottle and store it in a cool and dry place.  3) Use it in place of your regular facewash. You will notice that your skin doesn't dry out that easily anymore. 3) Home-made Facial Cleanser For Oily Skin.  Oily skin is naturally oily. Therefore, people tend to clean it often with harsh soaps to get rid of the excess oil. Washing excessively will rid your skin of the oil, but the skin will counteract it by producing even more oil instead. Maintaining a delicate balance is important. Here is a facial cleanser which will clean the excess oil without drying the skin. Aloe Vera And Tea Tree Facial Cleanser For Oily Skin.  Ingredients:.  1) 1/4 cup baby wash.  2) 2 tablespoons fresh aloe vera gel.  3) 3-4 drops tea tree oil. Method:.  1) In a clean bottle, mix the baby wash and fresh aloe vera gel together nicely.  2) Add the tea tree oil.  3) Close the bottle and shake to mix everything well.

VNearly 60 years ago, the US Navy launched Vanguard-1 as a response to the Soviet Sputnik. Six decades on, it\u2019s still circling our planet. From his desk at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, space debris analyst Tim Flohrer keeps track of the 23,000 or so catalogued objects currently orbiting the Earth. They range from spacecraft and satellites \u2013 some working, most not \u2013 to discarded rocket stages and fragmented space hardware. All of them the result of 60 years of space exploration. Using radar data from the US Space Surveillance Network (also, primarily, the country\u2019s early warning system) and observations from optical telescopes, Flohrer helps ensure none of this space junk puts operational spacecraft at risk. Before we speak, I\u2019ve asked him to check on object 1958-002B, also known as Vanguard 1. Launched in March 1958, this grapefruit-sized shiny metal sphere was boosted into a high elliptical orbit. And it\u2019s still there, passing between 650 and 3,800km (406 to 2,375 miles) from the Earth. \u201cThe earlier satellites, such as Sputnik, have all re-entered the atmosphere,\u201d says Flohrer. \u201cBut I estimate that Vanguard 1 will remain in orbit for several hundred, if not a thousand years.\u201d. Conceived by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in 1955, Vanguard was to be America\u2019s first satellite programme. The Vanguard system consisted of a three-stage rocket designed to launch a civilian scientific spacecraft. The rocket, satellite and an ambitious network of tracking stations would form part of the US contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. This global collaboration of scientific research involved 67 nations, including both sides of the Iron Curtain. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a space race,\u201d says NRL Historian, Angelina Callahan. \u201cThe US was always forthright in terms of launch and intended purposes for the satellite but the Soviets held their cards closer to their chest.\u201d. So, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik on 4 October 1957, it came as a shock. \u201cA lot of the disappointment of Sputnik [for the US satellite team] was from the fact that their partners in this international partnership were not telling them they were sending a satellite up,\u201d says Callahan. The rockets that launched the Vanguard satellites were based on the German V-2 design (Credit: Getty Images). \u201cThere was tremendous fear generated by Sputnik,\u201d says Tom Lassman, curator of Cold War rockets at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. An identical \u201cflight backup\u201d of the Vanguard 1 satellite is on display at the Institution\u2019s Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport. \u201cSputnik made military leaders realise the Soviet Union could hit us with a missile.\u201d In the weeks that followed the Soviet launch, pressure from the Eisenhower White House mounted on the Navy team to launch a US satellite as soon as possible. On 6 December 1957, what had originally been planned as a further incremental test of Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 (TV3) became a major public event. Whereas the Soviets only announced Sputnik after it had successfully reached orbit, politicians, senior military figures and the world\u2019s media gathered at Cape Canaveral, Florida for the US launch.  There\u2019s a lot of failure in a successful research and development process \u2013 Angelina Callahan, NRL historian . After a series of countdown delays, at 11:44, the Vanguard rocket lifted from the launch pad. A few seconds later, someone in the control room shouted: "Look out! Oh God, no!" as the rocket rose four feet in the air and crashed back to the ground in a ball of flame. The nose cone was thrown clear \u2013 the Vanguard satellite still beeping. (You can read a full account of the disaster in this Nasa report). The New York Times described the explosion as a \u201cblow to US prestige\u201d, Senator Lyndon Johnson called it \u201chumiliating\u201d. Others were even less diplomatic \u2013 newspapers dubbing the US satellite variously \u201cflopnik\u201d, \u201ckaputnik\u201d and \u201cstayputnik\u201d. For the NRL team, it really wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of failure in a successful research and development process,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cDuring the course of these failures, they developed a very good system.\u201d. Ex-Nazi rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun, who had long been pushing to launch something \u2013 anything \u2013 into orbit, seized the opportunity. With backing from the US Army, he had been developing the Jupiter rocket \u2013 an evolution of his V2 ballistic missile. The Vanguard programme was beset with several launch failures (Credit: US Navy). \u201cThe priority was to get something up as quickly as possible,\u201d says Lassman. On 31 January 1958, one of von Braun\u2019s Jupiter launchers blasted Explorer 1 \u2013 a satellite designed and built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California in just three months \u2013 into orbit. America\u2019s first satellite was fitted with a cosmic ray detector to measure the space radiation environment. Designed by James Van Allen of the University of Iowa, the instrument revealed a belt of charged particles trapped by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which became known as the Van Allen Belts. Finally, on 17 March 1958, it was the Navy\u2019s turn. Under clear skies, NRL\u2019s Vanguard rocket carried Vanguard 1 into orbit. The tiny spacecraft was soon sending back its first radio signals. In fact, because it was the first satellite powered by solar cells, the spacecraft was still transmitting data until 1965. Explorer 1 only lasted a few months.  Not only is Vanguard 1 still in orbit, its legacy lives on . Although not the first satellite, Vanguard 1 was still a remarkable achievement. As well as proving the technology of a new launcher system, the ground station network and solar cells, the satellite showed how our planet bulges out around the equator. Equipped with an instrument to measure atmospheric density, it provided the first-ever measurements of the Earth\u2019s tenuous outer atmosphere and an estimate of the number of micrometeorites surrounding the planet \u2013 all vital information for future spacecraft. As a military-funded project, this also fed into calculations for the accuracy of ICBM trajectories. Not only is Vanguard 1 still in orbit, its legacy lives on. The rocket system forms the basis for the Delta launch vehicle, one of the world\u2019s most successful launchers. Long term tracking of the satellite continues to help scientists understand the influence of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on satellites and how orbits decay over time. Perhaps most importantly, Vanguard 1 revealed the potential of satellites on which we\u2019re all now dependent. Vanguard 3, which is at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, bears the damage from its failed launch (Credit: Audin/Wikimedia Commons). \u201cThe NRL produced a classified report talking about the satellites the US Navy would need in future decades,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cIt included weather, navigation, communication and reconnaissance satellites and the report closed with all the science that would be needed to make those systems viable.\u201d. Sixty years on, that science and those predictions have become reality. The satellite that helped make this possible, and the team behind it, deserve to be remembered. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d says Lassman. \u201cWe not only have an artefact in the museum, we have one flying around in space \u2013 it\u2019s living history.\u201d. --.

VActress Katrina Kaif has been roped in as the brand ambassador of eyewear company Lenskart. The actress will be the face of Lenskart for the next two years and would also feature in the brand\u2019s new campaign, said a statement. \u201cI am delighted to be associated with Lenskart\u2026 It\u2019s very important for me to find synergies with my brand associations and I believe Lenskart resonates the same. Lenskart is a brand loved by Indian youth and this is a conscious effort to connect with the fashion savvy Indians,\u201d said the actress. Commenting on the new campaign launch, Peyush Bansal, Founder and CEO, Lenskart.com says that the brand is all about fun, fashion, playfulness and friendliness \u2014 and Katrina is the perfect fit. \u201cKatrina, we feel, is all of this too naturally, hence a perfect fit and not a forced fit.

VEight years after it was launched, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana remains hamstrung by inflexible procedures and an inadequate coverage ceiling, finds new evaluation of its impact. Health insurance in low- and middle-income countries is recognised as a strategy to improve health access and facilitate Universal Health Care (UHC) by reducing the financial burden of accessing good health. In India\u2019s public health calendar, the recent past has been eventful. The head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, has become the first Indian on the global leadership team of the World Health Organisation. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the state with one of India\u2019s worst health indicators, has challenged Kerala, by far the best performer on those indicators, to \u201csee how the system works\u201d in his state. And an evaluation of a flagship health insurance scheme for the poor has found that it \u201chas been ineffective in reducing the burden of out-of-pocket spending on poor households\u201d. While the first two piqued greater interest, the quantitative evaluation of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), carried out eight years after its launch, is extremely important. \u201cOne of the main objectives of any health insurance scheme is to provide financial coverage (or risk protection) by reducing such burden while enhancing use of healthcare,\u201d Dr Anup Karan of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and first author of the study, Extending health insurance to the poor in India: An impact evaluation of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana on out-of-pocket spending for healthcare, told The Indian Express. \u201cWe found that RSBY has not been able to reduce out-of-pocket payment for healthcare for the poor, and they face the catastrophic impact of such payments,\u201d Dr Karan said. Health insurance in low- and middle-income countries is recognised as a strategy to improve health access and facilitate Universal Health Care (UHC) by reducing the financial burden of accessing good health. WHO DG Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus has repeatedly stressed that UHC is a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d governments must make, irrespective of income levels. Dr Winnie Yip, professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, said, \u201cTo move towards UHC, risk pooling and prepayment are necessary. When a large proportion of health expenditure is funded by out-of-pocket payment, as is the case in India, households or individuals are subject to major financial risk when they fall ill, because there is no sharing of risk.\u201d. In India, insurance is often associated with for-profit private insurance, Dr Yip said, when \u201cthe majority of the world\u2019s insurance is social or public health insurance\u201d. In Thailand, UHC has been implemented using social insurance. \u201cComplete tax revenue financing, like in the UK, is not feasible for lower and lower-middle income countries, including India. To have the government pay for everybody and everything (is not feasible), so individual contribution is needed,\u201d Dr Yip said. ***. RSBY, a tax-financed health insurance that is managed through private insurance companies, was introduced in 2008 for inpatient care to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. Over 40 million families were enrolled till September 2016. The evaluation, also co-authored by Dr Ajay Mahal of the University of Melbourne, was published in the peer reviewed Journal of Social Medicine. It used cross-sectional household-level survey data from the 1999-2000, 2004-05 and 2011-12 phases of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), and district records of enrolment information. So, where is India going wrong with the first national scheme of its kind?. For starters, the authors advocate the immediate inclusion of outpatient care in the insurance scheme. Outpatient care comprises up to 70% of total healthcare utilisation in India and 60% of total health expenditure. \u201cUnless full, or at least chronic conditions, are covered, I don\u2019t think any scheme can provide any significant financial risk protection to Indian families,\u201d Dr Karan said. This, he said, was particularly critical for the poor, \u201cas they would prefer not to get hospitalised and lose their work days and wages\u201d. Dr Yip explained that because OP is not covered, \u201cpeople could delay seeking care until they are more severely ill, which is costly both from the perspective of costs and health\u201d. Despite rising healthcare costs, the scheme continues to be capped at Rs 30,000 since 2008. \u201cThere has not been any revision, while the costs of hospitalisation have almost doubled,\u201d Dr Karan said. For a family of 4 or 4.5 persons, it was \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d, he said, when the average expenditure on one hospitalisation in the private sector is around Rs 26,000. \u201cThis means that even if one member of the family gets hospitalised in a year, the financial coverage is exhausted,\u201d Dr Karan said. Also, the cap does not take into account post-hospitalisation costs. ***. The one positive impact of the scheme was in non-medical spending, the study found. Explaining the \u201cvirtual income transfer\u201d effect of the scheme, Dr Karan said, \u201cThe poor increased their household consumption level, or non-medical spending, after RSBY intervention. The increase is very small, but statistically significant. This is certainly an indirect benefit of the scheme which needs deeper exploration.\u201d. The authors also caution that beneficiaries may have been persuaded by providers to utilise inpatient services that were not covered by RSBY, or denied care. \u201cMost countries have found that health insurance without changing provider behaviour usually results in cost inflation. It was found that it is necessary to establish \u2018strategic purchasing\u2019 through quality monitoring, using provider payment methods that incentivise providers to reduce unnecessary prescriptions and tests, and establishing an IT system to audit providers,\u201d Dr Yip said. Without these steps, she said, \u201cno matter how much more RSBY increases coverage, it still may not reduce financial risk\u201d. Impact evaluation is considered increasingly necessary in all realms of public policy, to understand what is working and what isn\u2019t. In India, Dr Karan said, there are only a few examples of rigorous impact evaluation, and fewer still for health financing schemes. The study gives the examples of four state social health insurance schemes, which reached mixed conclusions. For example, an evaluation of the Yeshasvini scheme in Karnataka by researchers from Delhi University, reported an over 70% reduction in out-pocket spending, and a 30% reduction in borrowings. Evaluating the Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme in Andhra Pradesh in 2012, the nonprofit thinktank Centre for Global Development found reduced inpatient out-of-pocket spending among enrolled families in phase I of the study, but relatively small impacts on outpatient out-of-pocket spending, and catastrophic payments.

VBlazes tear through Calistoga.  (CNN)Alyssa O'Gorman and her family fled their home in the nick of time, dodging wind-driven wildfires roaring across northern California's wine country. As the flames closed in Sunday night, they left without a change of clothes. O'Gorman, her parents and her grandfather gathered up their animals and were out of the house in minutes. O'Gorman had been driving home from her job as nursing assistant when she first spotted flames. . After evacuating the house, which sits at the dead end of a one-lane road in rural Napa County, she and her family watched from a distance as a propane tank exploded and their home's roof caught fire. If she hadn't been coming home from work and her parents were sleeping, "we would have been in the house trapped," she said. Veronica Ortega was at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Santa Rosa when she smelled smoke and saw flames as she glanced out the window of her fiancé's room on the fourth floor. The two soon were loaded onto a city bus and shuttled away. O'Gorman and Ortega were among many who scrambled to safety as the blazes rolled through, forcing emergency evacuations from the hospital, homes and hotels. . The fires spread across roads and torched several structures, local officials told CNN. Multiple people were treated for injuries, CNN affiliate KPIX reported. Napa really hurting right now. I pray everyone gets home safe and we pull together as a community to help those who are affected. pic.twitter.com/Gr47w9ZITu. \u2014 Cakes (@MikaylaSegura) October 9, 2017 . The National Weather Service in San Francisco on Sunday issued a "red flag warning" for the Bay Area. citing current or impending critical fire weather conditions. The warning is to last until Tuesday morning. It cited dry, "windy locations through the Napa Valley and northern Sonoma County valleys" and winds with "frequent gusts" of 30 mph. "Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly," the warning said. The blazes engulfed acreage in Sonoma and Napa counties as responders worked through the night to fight the fires. KPIX said the blazes had stretched local firefighting resources -- and calls were out for assistance. In Sonoma County, Santa Rosa's city manager declared the fires a local emergency. News footage showed hospital patients wheeled out on stretchers. #GOES16 satellite update: around 3 am Monday morning. Satellite continues to show multiple wild fires across the North Bay, and a new fire start has been detected just to the east of Cloverdale. Strong and gusty northeast winds will continue through at least mid morning. #cawx pic.twitter.com/jufkkU38wZ. \u2014 NWS Bay Area (@NWSBayArea) October 9, 2017 . The city also ordered evacuations in several neighborhoods. Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said hotels were evacuated and shelters were set up. The county is working to set up shelters at fairgrounds to house animals. In Napa County, evacuations were underway as firefighters battled a 200-acre wildfire, according to Cal Fire. Another wildifre is burning in Calistoga, where evacuations are also underway. Fires were also reported in Mendocino and Lake counties. In Santa Rosa, one fire has burned 20,000 acres. Meanwhile, as she takes refuge with a relative in Santa Rosa, O'Gorman can't stop thinking about about the valuables and keepsakes left behind in the home -- which she now believes is gone. She's too distraught to sleep. "I'm probably not going to," she says. "Not until I can see my house." .

VBoys lie on beds while being treated at a cholera treatment center in Sanaa, Yemen October 8, 2017. Picture taken October 8, 2017.REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah. HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - One of the latest victims of the cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in Yemen had yet to even take her first breath. . Her mother Safaa Issa Kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbour. \u201cMy stomach started hurting more and more,\u201d said Kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm. . Once there, she was referred by nurse Hayam al-Shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration -- one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October, according to doctors at the city\u2019s Thawra hospital. . \u201cI felt like death,\u201d Kaheel said, her voice strained. \u201cThank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhoea hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d . The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrhoeal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year. . Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable. . The cholera ward is full of children -- some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing. .  Cholera-infected Siddique Nuruddin Ali, 7, lies on a bed at a cholera treatment center in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen October 8, 2017. Picture taken October 8, 2017.REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad . Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones. . Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness. . Yemen\u2019s war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power. . At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. . The country\u2019s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid. . Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon. . \u201cThe cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations,\u201d she warned. .

VHaving been reprimanded by her boss (and President Trump) for her previous divisive remarks, ESPN's Jamele Hill called on football fans to boycott advertisers who are aligned with teams pushing back against 'kneeling'. As a reminder, after her last outburst, here is what ESPN president John Skipper said in a memo to staffers: . "ESPN is about sports... It is not a political organization." . So much for that... As Fox News reports, the ESPN anchor who called President Trump a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d on Twitter last month is now calling for a boycott of advertisers aligned with "America's Team.". If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers. Don't place the burden squarely on the players. https://t.co/Gc48kchkuv. \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) October 9, 2017. Jemele Hill, host of "SC6," called on fans to take indirect action against the Dallas Cowboys after owner Jerry Jones told players they would be benched if they didn't stand up during the national anthem. Hill, an outspoken liberal, tweeted that Jones \u201chas created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones\u2026 If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts.\u201d. The ESPN host wrote, \u201cBy drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fanbase happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fanbase feels.\u201d. She urged \u201cpaying customers\u201d to \u201cboycott his advertisers\u201d if they don\u2019t agree with Jones\u2019 comments. Hill quoted a list of Cowboys\u2019 advertisers in one of her tweets, which included AT&T, Bank of America, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Ford Motors, MillerCoors and Pepsi, and sent a message to her 760,000-plus Twitter followers. \u201cChange happens when advertisers are impacted,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cIf you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.\u201d. However, as Daily Caller\u2019s David Hookstead wrote... \u201cThe NFL is the biggest crutch keeping ESPN alive. If the NFL cuts ties, which would be reasonable if the network\u2019s employees start calling for a boycott, ESPN would be in massive trouble.". \u201cNot sure how happy ESPN management will be with an employee telling NFL fans to boycott NFL related sponsors, given the fact that ESPN needs the NFL to stay alive.\u201d. Let's see John Skip[per squirm out of this one.

VJosh Lilley Gallery presents \u201cDe Ramp\u201d, fourth solo exhibition of British painter NICK GOSS. Nick Goss was born in 1981 in Bristol. He graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art in 2006 and received Postgraduate Degree from the Royal Academy, London, in 2009. In his early years he spent the summers in Zeeland, a picturesque lowland in West Holland, where a devastating North Sea flood occurred in 1953, which was named \u2018De Ramp\u2019. The narration of this event about displacement of people and animals, their helplessness affected the artist hugely. Afterwards, J. G. Ballard\u2019s \u201cThe Drowned World\u201d about a devastating flood in London inspired him to create his series of painting \u201cDe Ramp\u201d. In this series, the artist draws pictures of semi-drowned horse wading through water, old women trudging with their earthly belongings towards unknown shelters. In the paintings, the artist gradually increased the water level in each scene, while subtly adding some minute details of the present day London, so that the effect becomes more gruesome on the viewers.The artist presents the paintings of De Ramp as if they are changing before the viewers. The Known landscape of London metamorphoses before us. The lone residential towers sprout up above the floodwaters and may be interpreted as tombstones or flowers \u2013 memories of life lost or tributes to life beginning again. They are also, simply, the things that the artist sees when he looks out his studio window. Goss\u2019 compositions deal with psychological space of crisis and freely fuse it with the world history on reference to the personal history. The compositions are rich with daily observations and literary fantasy that shows pure pictorial effects taken the lessons of centuries of art practices. The images on view at De Ramp challenge at one go the eye and the mind. Yet they can be navigated through one another.

VDespite the withdrawal of a shutdown in the Bengal hills, nearly 60 per cent the workers are yet to resume work at the Darjeeling tea gardens, industry officials said on Sunday. "About 60 per cent of around one lakh workers of the Darjeeling tea industry have not joined work even after the withdrawal of the shutdown," Darjeeling Tea Association's Chairman Binod Mohan told IANS. According to him, the prolonged shutdown might have forced the workforce to venture out of the hills and seek alternate jobs. . "Hopefully, they will come back soon and join work," he said adding that the annual tea production had been "affected severely" this year and the only thing required to be done is "clearing the jungle" that has grown during the strike. "There was no work at Darjeeling tea gardens for over 100 days. A significant part of the workforce migrated to other places for alternative jobs. The situation in Darjeeling still remains fragile. It seems workers who got some earning sources outside are taking their time to return," said Centre of Indian Trade Unions' General Secretary (tea industry) Zia- Ul-Alam, also convener of Joint Forum of Trade Unions, an umbrella organisation of trade unions working in tea sector. All stakeholders, including all political parties in the hills, Centre and state government and tea industry players must sit together to build confidence among workers, he said. Mohan said the tea industry has started making bonus payments to the workers. After a recent tripartite meeting between workers' unions, tea garden owners and the government, it was decided the bonus to workers would be paid at 19.75 per cent of the annual wage earnings for the financial year 2016-17. Due to the shutdown, all plucking and manufacturing operations in the 87 gardens in Darjeeling was suspended and there was no second flush production, considered premium variety contributing to about 20 per cent of the annual industry production and accounting for approximately 40 per cent of the annual revenue, Mohan said. The industry sought a Rs 230 crore-Rs 240 crore financial support from the government, he added.

VGATE topper shares his exam strategy, preparation tips and why he choose to pursue PhD from IISc instead of joining any PSU . Ameya Dravid is pursuing PhD from IISc. The registration process for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) 2018 will end today. The candidates can now start preparing for the entrance exam that is scheduled to be held in February. One of the best ways to begin your studies is by taking tips from those who have successfully qualified the exam. Pune\u2019s Ameya Dravid achieved All India Rank 2 in GATE 2017 and at present, pursuing PhD from his dream college \u2014 Indian Institute of Science (IISc). His father is an engineer turn entrepreneur and mother is an advocate. He calls himself a \u201cnerd\u201d as, unlike his peers, he hasn\u2019t join PSUs or corporate world. He shares his preparation strategy and love for science with us:. Tell us about your background. Did you always wish to join IISc?. I did my engineering from VIT University in Biotechnology. I always wanted to study science and therefore kept preparing for GATE simultaneously. While I find the road to pursue B Tech pretty much marked out, in Ph D you have to decide everything yourself. I took time to adjust but now feel confident and more independent. Why didn\u2019t you take up a job in a PSU or give CAT like many aspirants?. Everyday when I wake up, I need to read something new. On the job, your learning gets limited. I have a passion for science since class 7. Also, I always knew that engineering is my real calling. This is one reason that holds me from applying in some corporate company or a PSU. Even after finishing B Tech, I didn\u2019t sit for placement. Since when did you start preparing for GATE?. My informal preparation had begun in the second semester itself. I started devoting few hours every day to revise subjects. However, it was during October \u2014 B Tech fourth semester \u2014 that I started studying seriously. My faculty prescribed some books and research material that helped me understand various concepts. How many hours did you give to preparation in the last months?. The last few months were hectic. There were semester exams as well as we needed to finish projects assigned to us. I used to wake up early to study for four to five hours before the class. Once back, I used to give another three hours to my preparation. During weekends too, I devoted seven-eight hours.  I took help of the old GATE papers to understand the pattern and the kind of topics that gets repeated. GATE is conducted every year by any of the old IITs. Did you find any similarities in the pattern? . I noticed that exam conducting body from IIT focus on certain topics. For instance, IIT Roorkee gives importance to bioprocessing. Have you taken any coaching? What were the sections you were not confident about?. I followed the test series from some online portals but didn\u2019t find a need to join coaching centres. I was pretty confident on self-study. I found immunology, plant biotechnology and animal technology difficult. . Name some important topics that you feel are a must read for any student attempting GATE exam?. The following topics are high scoring:.  1) Antibodies and cells of immune system 2) Cell growth and reaction kinetics 3) Resistance in plants 4) Basic integration and differentiation 5) Basics of Vectors and Matrices 6) Flatfile formats in Bioinformatics 7) Antibiotic resistance mechanisms. How did you rejuvenate?. I am a nerd, science comes naturally to me and therefore I feel happy studying it. However, in-between, I used to watch Breaking Bag and Friends. They are quite a stress-busters.

V Fintech firm Qbera on Monday announced its partnership with Droom to provide easy financing options for purchasing pre-owned cars, bikes or new cars from the online automobile marketplace. Aspiring automobile owners can now choose from more than 50 lakh options on Droom, which include cars, bikes, scooters, and super cars and finance their dream vehicle with unsecured personal loans from Qbera. Also, With the help of a driven team of experts and cutting-edge innovation, the platform approves and disburses personal loans of up to Rs. 7.5 lakh in as little as 24 hours. "Traditional lenders have exhaustive and strict criteria when it comes to funding auto loans for pre-owned vehicles. Due to long and time-consuming verification procedures, borrowers have to undergo arduous waiting periods before they receive the funds in their bank accounts. Moreover, traditional financial institutes offer loans at interest rates which start from 14 percent and can go as high as 20 percent. Qbera, on the other hand, follows a risk-based approval procedure and offers borrowers instant loans at the same rate in the shortest span of time. Hence, instead of seeking second-hand car loans, it would be a wiser option to apply for a personal loan on our platform," said Aditya Kumar founder and CEO, Qbera. "Getting auto loans for used vehicles in India is full of pain points, simply because it takes forever. High rejection rates, lots of paperwork and unaffordable credit terms make it difficult for consumers seeking loans for used vehicles. Through our partnership with Qbera, we are offering a new-age auto financing option to make the loan disbursal process smoother, more affordable, efficient, and paperless. Hence, we are confident that this collaboration will prove to be a win-win situation for both companies and consumers," added Sandeep Aggarwal founder and CEO, Droom. India's automobile industry displays humungous potential and is currently the third largest market in the world. The pre-owned car market in the country, with approximate annual sales of 3.6 million cars, is growing at an exponential rate of 20-25 percent and is expected to grow to 4x of its current value by 2020. Currently, a majority of automobile deals by millennials in India are conducted online. Traditional lenders are often reluctant to finance pre-owned cars due to the faster rate of depreciation, thus offering a sizeable market opportunity for digital lending platforms like Qbera in this segment. The platform assesses borrowers based on a wide range of non-traditional criteria in addition to traditional information such as their income, credit score, social score, and FOIR/DTI to ensure that they have the capacity to repay the loans.

VChristchurch builder Michael McGrath, 49, has been missing since May 21. The brother of missing Christchurch man Michael McGrath appears to have lost hope his sibling is still alive. It has been 141 days since McGrath, 49, left his Halswell home without his 1994 blue Subaru Legacy or his bike. The cash-job builder left his home locked with his wallet and money inside on May 21. On Saturday his brother Simon McGrath posted a moving tribute on Facebook. Simon McGrath posted a tribute to his brother on Facebook on Saturday. "Bro it's been over 4 months since I last saw you, but it seems just like yesterday. Now the days drift on and on and nothing is and will ever be the same. "When you were around there was always a degree of expectancy \u2013 reflections of the good times we had and of what future projects you were scheming up. David Benbow outside his house in Halswell. "Now all I am left with is the ever lasting memories and possibilities of what could have been. RIP \u2013 the sun will set for you.". In a Police Ten 7 television show appearance in July, McGrath said he knew straight away "something bad had happened" to his brother. "We have these nightmares, I wake up and I'm living the nightmare. "I think something sinister has happened to him.". Police have said David Charles Benbow, Michael McGrath's childhood friend, was a "person of interest" who needed to be "eliminated" from the missing person inquiry. . Officers spent about 10 days combing Benbow's Halswell home and, it is understood, found no sign of anything untoward. . Benbow was one of two people to visit McGrath's home late on the afternoon of May 21. He went to the Parkhouse Rd, Sockburn transfer station soon after McGrath's disappearance to dump a small amount of rubbish. . They seized and searched his 1999 Toyota Camry car, which he had dropped at a Halswell panelbeaters between May 21 and May 23, then returned it. . Benbow and McGrath went to Hillmorton High School together and drank together at a Halswell pub. Benbow's brother played rugby with McGrath. . Benbow's former partner, Joanna Green, who was also a person of interest to the inquiry and a friend of McGrath's, was at school with both men and had split from Benbow before McGrath went missing. Stuff has visited Benbow several times. He has claimed he is the victim of a witch hunt by police and media. He said early on he was as surprised as anyone at McGrath's disappearance and had no idea where he would have gone.

VOne of five tigers at Hamilton Zoo in the revamped enclosure. Tigers at Hamilton Zoo now have the mother of all cat poles to climb on. Staff have spent months revamping the "tired" 2001 enclosure and it now boasts a big cat climbing post, a paddling pool, tunnels and a tweaked soundscape. "We wanted to change it up to make it more viewable for our visitors but also exciting and still creating a habitat that tigers would want to be in," curator Catherine Nichols said. The rope climber has been added to encourage tigers like Oz to climb as they would in their natural habitat. "So if you think of them in their natural habitat they've still got areas to hide in, there are young trees that will grow up and be a bit more of a screen and shade.". The redesign is not a response to the death of Samantha Kudeweh in 2015 who was fatally attacked in an tiger enclosure. . The waterfall has been elevated to improve sound. The design was a team effort with the zoo keepers considering the personalities of the five Sumatran cats and what they could do to encourage their natural behaviour. Sound was a significant part of that. They elevated the waterfall which increases the sound of water flowing and also circulates the pool to give it movement and catch the Tigers' attention. It also creates a shallow pool and the idea is that Tigers will use it to cool off in summer. They are, after all, adapted to swim with their partially webbed paws. The team made tunnels to create a feeling of security and comfort. Most of the work was done in-house with the keepers working with the ground maintenance staff and other team members. Gone is the old bamboo hedge. "It was a feature the Tigers would hide under so we were conscious that visitors were turning up and not always getting to see the tigers. They are secretive by nature. They are designed to hide so we had to think about that.". The revamp has seen two tunnels added so the Tigers can get shade and also feel more secure. There is also a tree growth area which gives tigers comfort. "It gives them security and comfort while still allowing us visibility. "I think they've really enjoyed it so far. They've put in a big climbing tower with a rope feature which allows the keepers to put an enticement up high to encourage them to climb.".

VExercising self-discipline helps set the tone for the rest of the day. CREDIT: Getty Images. What is the best early morning habit for success? originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. . Answer by Joshua Otusanya, Accountant, Stand up Comedian, Former Division 1 Athlete , on Quora:. Drink Water On An Empty Stomach - I was a Division 1 soccer player in college and one of the things we were taught was to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning. Do it on an empty stomach immediately after you wake up. It is super simple and has a number of benefits such as flushing out toxins, speeding up your metabolism, and flushing out your bowels. Meditate - Set aside 10-20 minutes a day to meditate. Meditation helps you manage stress, stabilize your mood, increase the gray matter in your brain, and more. Dance - Turn on your favorite music and dance! Let loose and start feeling excited about the day. Let the music play as you go through your morning routine. This helps you start your day off on a happy note. Wim Hof Breathing Method - Fill your brain and blood with fresh oxygen. Doing this technique for just 10 minutes makes you feel more alert and alive. For more information on this, click here => Wim Hof Breathing Method. Create A Task List - Put together a short and concise list of things you want to get done for the day. Doing so keeps you focused and gives you a clear sense of direction for the day. Go For A Run - As a former Division 1 soccer player in college, we started off most of our mornings by running, and it's incredibly good for you. Speed up your metabolism and develop self-discipline while taking in fresh oxygen. I also found that morning exercise is a fantastic way to wake yourself up in the morning. Free-Write - You will find this especially beneficial if you're an artist. Before going to sleep, set a pen and notebook by your bed. When you wake up the next morning, immediately start free-writing anything that comes to mind for three whole pages. Don't limit yourself. If you have nothing to say, write what you're currently wearing. The goal is to not stop writing. This "brain dump" exercise will leave you feeling incredibly refreshed in a unique way. Watch Motivational Videos - Who doesn't love getting pumped up in the morning to start off the day?. Wake Up Earlier - Exercising this element of self-discipline helps set the tone for the rest of the day. Studies show that doing so increases productivity throughout the rest of the day. This may not apply to you if you are someone who is more productive late at night. Clean Up - You know the deal. Take a shower, brush your teeth, and dress for success. Here is an additional video I made showing you what to do in the morning to have a successful day:.

VNew Delhi [India], Oct. 9 (ANI): The sport of Golf is gaining momentum in India with a breezy pace. Bounded by natural prettiness with green grass all around, the country boasts some of world\u2019s best Golf courses. Emerging trend of playing golf among the youth has motivated the government and private players to improve infrastructure including golf courses of international standards and trained manpower. The government is now keen to exploit golf tourism in its true potential, and aims to promote Golf for the development of overall ecosystem of tourism. \u201cWe are grateful to the Ministry of Tourism who have initiated a Golf Tourism Policy \u2013 how to promote India as a golf tourism destination. In India, we have beautiful golf courses; right from Jammu and Kashmir to Deep South we have one of the best golf courses in the world. Golf needs a good weather, and in India, out of 365 days, almost 324 days are sunny, which are very rare in the world. So, that is very important for golf,\u201d said Rajan Sehgal, President, India Golf Tourism Association. India has about 220 golf courses, in which 25 are signature golf courses which are at par with international standards. Many private resorts and golf courses are providing its guests the world\u2019s best dining, open-air Jacuzzis along with the golfing facilities. One such property is the nine-acre large Jaypee Greens Golf and Spa Resort, located on the outskirts of the national capital. Designed by veteran golfer Greg Norman, the resort promises some of the most stunning views of the beautiful 18-hole golf course. It attracts many foreign tourists who love to spend their time by playing golf along with dining. \u201cJay Pee is one of the most beautiful golf courses. It\u2019s easy to come and play here as a guest, and as a visitor. For me, it is very comfortable because it is near to Delhi and the level and quality of the course is very high. I have seen lot of course in the world and I think it\u2019s one of the best in India,\u201d said Alexander, a tourist from Russia. To promote golf culture and attract tourists, over 100 new golf courses are required in the country. It will not only help attract tourists and generate revenue for the state, but also open new job opportunities for the youth. India Golf Tourism Association has plans to train caddies to guide foreign golfers and make them aware about other tourist attractions. \u201cWe are also working with the Ministry of Tourism on a skill development basis as to how to train these caddies, because when you go to Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia, their caddies are so professionally trained that it\u2019s an attraction. In India also, we are training some caddies; not only about golf, but when they are helping foreign golfers during the course for around four and half yeurs, they should tell them about the city also,\u201d said Rajan. Vikram Sethi is a well-known golf coach who foresees a bright future for golf in India. He believes an aggressive promotion will help attract world golfers to the country. \u201cWe do have potential to be golf tourism country, though a lot needs to be done. But, to say it\u2019s not possible would be wrong. We have excellent golf courses all over the country. In the north, Delhi being the city which has maximum number of courses, then south \u2013 Bangalore has very good courses, Pune has very good courses. East might be little weak, but we have one of the oldest Royal Calcutta Club. So we have golf all around the country, it\u2019s just the question of being able to promote it,\u201d added Vikram Sethi, a Golf coach. With golf courses spreading to every nook and corner of India and the growing popularity of the sport backed by sightseeing of the sports \u2013 Golf enthusiasts are looking forward to visiting India for a holiday that goes beyond tees and greens.

VTwo "Emotion dolls" at the gender-neutral Egalia preschool in Sweden.  (CNN)From the moment a child is born, its gender pretty much determines how they will dress, which toys they'll be given and ultimately how they are meant to behave within society. . But some schools in Sweden are trying to strip away such gender norms. . There's nothing obviously out of the ordinary at Sweden's gender-neutral preschools at first glance. There are no designated areas to play with dolls or building blocks. The toys have been strategically jumbled to create an environment for girls and boys to play together. These two preschools in Sweden -- Nicolaigarden and Egalia (meaning 'equality' in Latin) -- go to great lengths to de-emphasize gender. Children are given the freedom to challenge and cross gender boundaries. Rather than encourage children to do particular things, the teachers are careful not to box children based on their gender or subtly discourage them from doing certain things. The school has removed the terms "girl" and "boy" completely. Instead they make a deliberate effort to call each child by their first name or the gender-neutral pronoun "hen". But is it necessary to intervene at such a young age, and what are the long-term effects?. Removing the 'gender straitjacket'. A new global study found that young girls and boys are outfitted with "gender straitjackets" by the age of 10, resulting in lifelong negative consequences. The Global Early Adolescent Study analyzed how gender is learned, enforced and reinforced among early adolescents in 15 countries. It concluded that culturally-enforced gender stereotypes -- which are linked to an increased risk of mental and physical health problems -- are firmly rooted between the ages of 10 and 14. The study found these stereotypes leave girls at greater risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence, child marriage, and HIV. For boys, the risks can include substance abuse and suicide. . In Sweden, which is ranked as the fourth-most equal country in the world when it comes to gender, the government has made a concerted effort to emphasize equality in the Education Act. Following a new amendment introduced in 1998 requiring all schools to work against gender stereotyping, Lotta Rajalin set up her first gender-neutral preschool for one to five-year-olds in Stockholm's Old Town. The gender-neutral policies at Rajalin's schools ensure that stories, songs and dramatizations are screened or re-scripted to include non-nuclear families (single parents or same-sex couples) and heroines sweeping princes off their feet. . Teachers opt for non-traditional plot twists to ensure that they're not reinforcing gender stereotypes. How to be a gender-neutral teacher. Perhaps the most important distinction in these preschools is the way the teachers treat each child. To help identify any unconscious bias they have when dealing with girls and boys, the teachers filmed themselves interacting with children and took note of how they responded to the different sexes. "After we had been filming and observing each other, we understood that it's not the children we have to change, it's ourselves," Rajalin tells CNN. They discovered they used different tones of voice when talking to girls or boys, and tolerated rowdiness in boys while discouraging it in girls. Similarly, they found themselves to be more likely to comfort a crying girl, while they would tell a crying boy to brush it off. . "When you change yourself and your thinking and your expectations, you will see new things and you will see that it's better for children's development," she says. Rajalin believes gender stereotypes limit the opportunities available to a child. Her gender-neutral teaching methods stem from what she calls "the whole life spectra" or "circle of opportunity." This circle is often divided into two semi-circles -- one for boys and one for girls. . Through gender-neutral teaching, Rajalin hopes to open up this circle of opportunities for all children to define themselves. "We try to take away the barriers which stop both girls and boys doing what they want to do," she says. "We want all children to have the same opportunities to feel, to express themselves, to like what color they like, to play the sport they're in, and so on. We don't want to limit them.". Following a small, structured observation of children at one of Rajalin's preschools, Ben Kenward, a researcher in psychology at Uppsala University in Sweden and Oxford Brookes University in England, found these children had a reduced tendency to be influenced by gender stereotypes, compared to a control group of children from a typical Swedish preschool. "The [gender neutral] pedagogy is having some of the effects that it's intended to have, and if you're committed to giving these young children the same opportunities ... then our study suggests that this kind of pedagogy is a good tool.". 'Brainwashing children'. However, these gender-neutral policies have generated much criticism over the years. Swedish psychiatrist and author David Eberhard considers calling boys and girls "hen" to be "intellectually dishonest" as it is being "blind to biological differences.". "This is the kind of brainwash that works when the kids are small and in the short run they adapt to this, but what happens when they go to normal school and they find out they were living in a sect?" he tells CNN. "This is a sort of a religious sect to say there's no differences between men and women, it has nothing to do with science.". Eberhard explained that he does not oppose boys choosing to play with dolls, but he draws the line at calling a girl or boy "it" or "hen". Rajalin believes a lot of criticism is misguided, as people do not fully understand what they are trying to do. "We are not trying to say girls should be boys or boys should be girls, we just want every person to have the right to be the person they are, regardless of gender," she says. Harmless 'experiment'. While Eberhard's views are strong, he says gender-neutral schooling is unlikely to have any negative long-term effects on young children. "I suppose that they [the children] are so sure about their identity that it doesn't matter," he says. "But, as individuals, you may very well have young kids of different sexes that become very frustrated or confused.". He believes Sweden would be better off solving the problem of gender inequality in the real world. Rajalin, however, believes adopting gender-neutral methods and exposing children to teachers of various different ethnicities, religions, sexes and sexual orientations, will better prepare them for the nuances of the real world. It will boost their self-confidence and set them up to be more successful in life, she says. Psychology professor Philip Hwang from the University of Gothenburg is not convinced. He thinks Rajalin's gender-neutral preschools are harmless but overrated. "I don't really see any harm in it, but I think it pleases the parents more than it changes the children," he tells CNN. He says he has met a couple of parents that really believe sending their children to gender-neutral preschool will have lasting effects and that they will grow up in a gender-neutral society. "It's a statement more than something that has actual effect on children's long-term development with regard to gender issues," he says. "It takes generations to change norms and values like this.". Even Kenward, who is optimistic that the gender-neutral pedagogy is creating equal opportunities for children of both genders, is unsure what the long-term effects will be. "It's an open question what happens to these children when they move into primary school," he says. "My guess is it [gender neutral pedagogy] could continue to influence their behavior potentially, not in a very strong way necessarily. But it may have some lasting effects.".

V Many of the idols created for Durga Puja are works of exquisite art and hence, worthy of preservation. Taking this into consideration, the State Government, as well as some private individuals and organisations, are going to turn some of the best Durga idols of Kolkata and its suburbs into permanent exhibits. The idol carved out of mahogany wood by the famous artiste, Bhabatosh Sutar, created for Chetla Agrani, will be permanently preserved at Eco Park by the State Government. This is being done at Eco Park for the last few years. Bhabatosh Sutar is himself involved in a preservation. The 6 feet-tall terracotta idol of Baidyabagan Nabapally at Singhi More in Amtala, made in the traditional style by veteran artiste, Biswanath Kumbhakar of Panchmura in Bankura, is going to be preserved at the artistes' conclave, Chander Haat, at Barisha, on the outskirts of Kolkata. Another venue for preservation is the Phire Dekha (meaning 'looking back') gallery beside Rabindra Sarovar Lake. Since the gallery is being renovated, no clay idols have been chosen for preservation this year. instead four fibre glass idols are being preserved the ones exhibited at Jagat Mukherjee Park, Shiv Mandir, Buroshibtala and Barisha Udayan Pally.UNI SJC KK.

Bronx rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie debuted at Number Four with his debut album The Bigger Artist, which only sold 10,000 copies but streaming equivalent albums (SEAs) bumped up its total haul to 67,000. . Miley Cyrus' latest Younger Now settled for Number Five and 45,000 total copies. That's a notable drop from Cyrus' last album Bangerz, which debuted at Number One in 2013; the free release Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz wasn't eligible for the Billboard 200 in 2015. The bottom half of the Top 10 featured all returning albums: Post Malone's Stoney (Number Six), Lil Uzi Vert's Luv Is Rage 2 (Seven), Imagine Dragons' Evolve (Eight), Kendrick Lamar's Damn. (Nine) and Ed Sheeran's Divide at Number 10.

V Academy Award-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo, who is set to reprise the role of Bruce Banner/Hulk in Marvel Studios' "Thor: Ragnarok", says it was fun for him to play two different characters.  "In this story Banner's been basically inside the Hulk for two years when we find him. During this time, all of the traumatic things in his life that have been making him afraid, making him doubtful, making him unable to enjoy his life, have been erased. His neurotransmitters and neuropathways have been completely re-wired. So when he comes awake, he's like an eight-year-old or 12-year-old boy," Ruffalo said. .  The actor added: "He has the same exuberance and curiosity and wonder. He finally also realizes that he's free of the Hulk.".  Describing Hulk's changes, Ruffalo said: "Hulk can be sad or happy. He's speaking. He's not only alive because of rage, so we can start to have more geography in the character's emotional life, his intelligence, what he does, what he eats, if he sleeps -- all the questions I've been dying to ask for years since playing this part. .  "It's a different Banner and a different Hulk. So I get to play two totally different characters in this movie, which is really fun.".  For Ruffalo, one lasting memory of working on the film was the welcoming ceremony by aboriginal natives at the start of production. .  "Taika Waititi, the director, is a Maori. So the people who did the ceremony are his Maori brothers here in Australia. They came to bless the movie. I've been to Native American blessings for the climate march in America that we had a couple years ago. They're always beautiful and sincere and invigorating and lovely and communal," Ruffalo said. .  The actor says he was excited to be part of the welcoming ceremony on this movie. .  "There's a lot of wisdom in that culture that we could carry with us. It was really beautiful and moving. I do feel like we were blessed," he added.  "Thor: Ragnarok" is set to release on November 3.  --IANS dc/rb/dg. ( 355 Words).

VIt may sound like a long process, but it'll be worth it. Anyone who has started going gray knows it doesn't happen overnight. You don't suddenly wake up with silver strands as if someone painted them while you slept; it starts with a pigment-deprived hair or two while some of your hair still grows in full color. And when more of your hair starts growing gray, you may start to notice a demarcation line in larger sections of your hair where the color stopped and the gray started. Going gray is a process, but realizing it's happening can feel very sudden. You may know immediately that you want to cover it with dye, or you may consider embracing the gray. In the case of our Birnur Aral, Ph.D., Director of the Good Housekeeping Institute's Health, Beauty and Environmental Sciences Lab, she did a little bit of both. "I had an unrelated allergic reaction that made my lips swell up for a few weeks, so I skipped my monthly hair color visit in order to give my body a break," explains Dr. Aral, who had been coloring her hair since her late 20s to cover up grays. "My roots grew about an inch, and I started noticing the salt-and-pepper pattern of my natural hair and toying with the idea of going gray.". Ultimately, Dr. Aral decided to go fully gray, and her experience both personally and professionally \u2014 this scientist has tested a whole lot of hair dye in her 20-plus years at the GH Institute! \u2014 can serve as a guide for you if you're ready to make the switch. Here's what you need to know. 1. A "color correction" can save you from growing it out. "Letting the roots grow would have been the cheapest solution but not the most stylish," Dr. Aral says. "Some people let the roots grow for an inch or two and then just get a pixie cut and transition that way. I wasn't ready for a drastic change of color and cut at the same time.". Instead, she opted for consultation with colorist Anne Marie Barros of Rubann in New York City. You have the option of essentially getting a "color correction," but instead of correcting it your natural or dyed color, your colorists correct it to be more like the gray shade growing in. Dr. Aral before her first appointment. 2. The transition process is a lot like getting highlights.  "To match the salt-and-pepper look of my roots, the colorist put in baby highlights all over my head," Dr. Aral says, noting that the foils stayed on much longer than she had personally experienced while coloring her hair in the past. "Toward the end of the lifting process, the colorist applied dark brown hair color to the remaining hair to create an all-over salt-and-pepper effect. When the foils were taken out and my hair was rinsed, a toner was applied to turn the highlights into a cool gray and silver.". Depending on the color you're transitioning away from, your experience may be different. And even if you're rarin' to go, you may have to wait a while before you even begin the process. "I tell people to get at least two inches of growth to begin with," says Nikki Ferrara, colorist at New York's Serge Normant at John Frieda. "Then I start to highlight.". 3. It can take a while \u2014 and get expensive. If you've never lightened your hair before, you could find yourself in the salon for an unexpected length of time during the coloring process. "I spent a total of seven hours in the salon and really saw how intensive the process was to justify the price tag," Dr. Aral explains. That price tag? About $500. That, of course, can vary with your starting color, your hair length, the salon you go to and the level of experience your colorist has. The initial highlighting session isn't the only thing that can take a while. It can take anywhere from six months to a year to fully go from color to gray, Ferrara says. 4. Some upkeep is required before your color is fully grown out. As with going platinum or any cooler blonde shade, you may find that the gray "highlights" get a little brassy. "The highlighted parts turn a bit yellow once the gray toner starts washing out," Dr. Aral said. Your colorist may also recommend coming in for more toner or glosses during the course of your transition. "Usually, you will have to gloss every once in a while to keep the brassiness at bay," Ferrara says. To help keep warm yellow tones at bay with less frequent salon visits, consider using a purple-toned shampoo like Clairol Shimmer Lights. This balances out brassiness and keeps your gray a gorgeous silver shade. Dr. Aral after her initial color treatment. 5. It's an adjustment \u2014 but worth it. Just like with any new hair color, you may find that how you normally do your makeup and hair or your wardrobe may not be as flattering as you once thought. "I feel with gray hair I need to have my hair styled \u2014 blown out or ironed \u2014 and makeup on; otherwise I look older than my usual self," Dr. Aral said. "I also feel like certain patterns and colors don't look good on me anymore. White, grey and black looks good but haven't figured the right bright colors yet.". Despite the adjustment, Dr. Aral has no regrets: "At this point I am not thinking of going back as I typically receive positive feedback.". Dr. Aral four months after her initial color treatment. "Most people won't have the patience, so they choose to color their hair again," Ferrara says. "But it's super-rewarding if you can stick it out and get on a routine with your colorist to get highlights every few months.". More From Hair Ideas for 2017.

VLhasa:  Seven tourists have been fined for chasing Tibetan antelopes in a national reserve in Tibet. The regional forestry authority said on Monday that the tourists in two off-road vehicles left the designated travel route and chased a herd of Tibetan antelopes in Serling Co National Nature Reserve in Nagqu Prefecture last week, reports Xinhua news agency. Forestry wardens seized their video footage, which recorded over one minute of the chasing. The tourists involved said they had wanted to get a closer look at the antelope. Representational image. AP. Zhaxi Doje, an official with the Tibet Forestry Bureau, said frightened Tibetan antelope running on top speed can suffer heart and lung failure. The tourists were fined 105,000 yuan ($16,000) in total for "disturbing rare wildlife's living and breeding". The population of Tibetan antelope declined sharply from 200,000 to 20,000 due to illegal hunting in the 1980s. Thanks to the habitat protection in the past decade, the population has recovered but the species is still listed among China's first class protected animals.

VNew Delhi, Oct 8 (PTI) The tourism ministry wants to change its staid, routine image and introduce an element of fun and celebration to its functioning. It is planning beach and adventure festivals, post-sunset concerts and flea markets to promote India as a preferred tourist destination. "We want to break stereotypes. We have realised that we have to do things differently to draw more tourists," tourism ministry secretary Rashmi Verma told PTI. The ministry is organising a 20-day feast and fiesta 'Paryatan Parv' across India from October 5, during which festivals are being held around tourist destinations to show people that "when you come to India you get an experience." . It is also tying up with other ministries and departments with which they have been at loggerheads traditionally, like the environment and forests ministry and the Archaeological Survey of India, which primarily are focused on conservation but have immense value for tourism. Verma says bringing the two departments aboard and at the same time promoting sustainable tourism will boost footfalls. In the days to come, the tourism ministry is scheduled to hold a beach festival in Gujarat, adventure festival in Rajasthan, flea markets in Manipur, motorbike rally in Uttarakhand, dance championships in Uttar Pradesh, and 'nukkad nataks', concerts by artistes, food festivals and other varied programmes. "Tourism is often looked upon as an elite thing, we want to tell everyone it is for the masses. Everyone who travels is important to us - someone going to a temple or to a restaurant is a tourist. We also want the youth to be travellers, take trips together and experience India," Verma said, adding that many of these programmes will be organised in the evenings to encourage tourists to stay on at their destination. This is only the beginning, Verma says, the ministry plans to make it a permanent fixture around places of tourist interest.

VFormer CIA Director Leon Panetta has called United States President Donald Trump's comment "calm before the storm" a "play for attention.". "I don't think it is responsible ... but in this instance we probably all should take a deep breath and try to assume that he's just making a play for attention and You begin to assume that it's more about getting attention than it is about proclaiming some kind of national policy," CNN reported quoting Panetta as saying. President Trump made "the calm before the storm" remark while taking photos alongside military leaders before Thursday night's dinner at the White House. The White House has denied explaining it. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to elaborate on what, specifically, the President meant. "As we have said many times before ... we're never going to say in advance what the President's going to do, and as he said last night in addition to those comments you're going to have to wait and see.". On being asked to explain his statement, Trump also responded with a "You'll find out," in a conference. Thursday's dinner followed a meeting in which Trump and the military leaders discussed Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and the fight against Islamic State. Trump is close to announcing his decision on whether to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement. He has time till October 15 to certify that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal. If he declines to certify Iran, then the Congress will have the option to re-impose sanctions on Iran, which would effectively end the deal.

VThe 2017 Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to American academic Richard Thaler. Richard Thaler is from the University of Chicago and has been given the prestigious award for his remarkable contributions to behavioural economics. The announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Monday said that Thaler \u201chas incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes\u201d. Thaler has authored books titled Nudge and Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics. Among his contributions are his \u201ctheory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect,\u201d the Academy said. Talking about the prize money he won, Thaler said that he would try to spend it as irrationally as possible. The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel\u2019s 1895 will.

V Navi Mumbai: A 100m low-lying stretch along the heavily crowded Ghansoli-Airoli service road, near Rabale police station, was flooded after a brief spell of rain on Sunday evening. .  The flooding in the stretch, which connects Rabale station vehicular underpass and Thane-Belapur Road, was due to a storm water nullah being choked. .   The road is also several inches below the drainage line on one side. Encroachments too have usurped most of the road and two of the four lanes. .  Meanwhile, two motorcyclists had a miraculous escape after their vehicles skidded badly on the stretch. .  Commuters had to wade through knee-deep water even on Monday due to the civic officials not acting on time. Kaushal Mishra, a commuter, said, "I had a bad fall in the waterlogged stretch and sustained bruises. I will take up the issue with the senior civic officials." .  Locals alleged that the civic body has not carried out cleaning of the drainage line which led to the flooding. "But their tall claims of efficient drainage system have fallen flat with the flooding even during sporadic rains. .  "Encroachments have hit laying of the sewage line, footpath, road widening and installation of streetlights. Once the rain recedes we will carry out asphalting work," said NMMC executive engineer Anil Nerpagare. .

VPorsche celebrates its British Le Mans winners with liveried-up 911 Carrera GTSs. Porsche loves a special edition 911 almost as much as it loves winning Le Mans. Which is our rather contrived way of introducing you to this trio, the three guises of 911 Carrera 4 GTS British Legends Edition. Each has been specced by one of Porsche\u2019s British Le Mans 24 hour victors. So there\u2019s the Carrera White car that pays tribute to Nick Tandy and his Porsche 919 Hybrid (winner of Le Mans in 2015), the Guards Red car that salutes Richard Attwood and his Porsche 917 (victorious in 1970) and the Sapphire Blue car, which is a nod to Derek Bell and his Porsche 962 (a pairing that won in 1982). Bell also took Porsche to Le Mans victory 1981, \u201986 and \u201987, mind\u2026. White it\u2019s initially odd that Porsche has used the heavier all-wheel-drive 911 GTS as the British Legend Edition\u2019s base, the spec that lies beneath makes a degree of sense. Massively adjustable electric seats, automatic wipers and widely adjustable suspension \u2013 plus all-weather grip \u2013 may all add weight and complexity to the pureness of a 911, but they do make driving one for a long period of time (y\u2019know, endurance racing style) easier. Bell\u2019s car even has a PDK paddleshift gearbox in it. But before the purists write angry comments below, PDK was used in 962s in the 1980s. It\u2019s optional in these limited editions, though, so you can stay manual if you wish. Each of the three cars gets colours and decals to mimic the livery of the car it\u2019s influenced by, and Tandy, Attwood and Bell\u2019s signatures feature too. There\u2019s carbon and Alcantara aplenty inside, with perhaps a little more credence than usual thanks to the explicit motorsport link. Beneath the rear deck is the same 444bhp 3.0-litre flat-six turbo engine as a standard Carrera GTS, with a 3.6sec 0-62mph time if you\u2019ve gone for PDK. It\u2019s almost precisely half as powerful as Tandy\u2019s circa-900bhp 919 Hybrid, while its 192mph top speed is down 32mph on the 2015 winner. Not to worry, though, as it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find yourself short of pace when driving the Mulsanne Straight, as your 911 can only really end up there in the 51 weeks of the year it\u2019s a public road. Prices vary depending on colour, ranging from £122,376 for the Attwood red car to £123,210 for Tandy white or Bell blue. Which is a reasonably healthy climb over the £101k of a standard Carrera 4 GTS, though these cars do come with a lot of options boxes ticked, accounting for at least half of the price premium. And they will be rare, too. They\u2019re only on sale in the UK, and while Porsche won\u2019t commit to telling us what the production run is, we\u2019d bet the pool of Le Mans die-hards with £123k and the requisite paucity of shyness to run one of these is small. Would you?.

VHailing from Koratty in Thrissur district, Krishnan is a final year postgraduate student in Sanskrit.  The proclamation was a royal decree, which opened temples of Travancore to the so-called lower caste Hindus in 1936. (Photo: PTI/Representational). Pathnamthitta (Kerala): Yedu Krishnan scripted history on Monday by becoming the first Dalit priest in Kerala to assume duties at the sanctum sanctorum of the Manappuram Lord Shiva Temple at nearby Thiruvalla. In a landmark step, 36 non-brahmins were recently recommended for appointment in various temples under the Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages at least 1,248 shrines in the state, including the famous Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala. Son of P.K. Ravi and Leela, Krishnan (22) had undergone 10 years training in Tantra shastra. He is among six Dalits out of the 36 non-Brahmins recommended for appointment as priests by the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board. The young priest took blessings of his guru K.K. Aniruddhan Thantri and entered the shrine with present chief priest Gopakumar Namboodiri, chanting mantras, temple officials said. Hailing from Koratty in Thrissur district, Krishnan is a final year postgraduate student in Sanskrit. He had begun performing pooja at the age of 15 at a local temple near his house. Krishan\u2019s presence inside the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine comes at a time when Kerala is set to observe the 81st anniversary of the historic Temple Entry proclamation on November 12. The proclamation was a royal decree, which opened temples of Travancore to the so-called lower caste Hindus in 1936. .

VHyderabad: The Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, hosted its first Human Library event on Sunday. The idea of the Human Library was born in the year 2000, when Ronni Abergel, a social activist, launched it in Copenhagen, Denmark. The Human Library now has around 600 book depots worldwide. The Hyderabad chapter was founded by Harshad Fad. Individuals from stigmatised sections of society, who are stereotyped on the basis of their ethnicity, religion, sexuality, disability, occupation, social status or lifestyle, volunteer as \u2018books\u2019 in this library. Readers are free to choose these human books from a catalogue. The books then share their life experiences with a group of readers and an interactive session follows. IIT Hyderabad hosted a total of 12 books in collaboration with the Hyderabad chapter of the Human Library. The books \u2018Chains of Freedom\u2019 and \u2018Price of Smiling\u2019 are popular with the readers. . Professor Haripriya Narasimhan, head of the department of liberal arts, IIT Hyderabad, said, \u201cThe Human Library is one such event which will enable young minds on campus to understand the deep-rooted prejudices that exist and also how the human spirit allows us to overcome these differences.\u201d . The Department of Liberal Arts endeavours to expose students to different perspectives of our lives as experienced by ordinary people, so that they can locate their disciplinary practices and objectives within the larger society. The Human Library is one such event which will enable the young minds on campus to understand the deep-rooted prejudices that exist and also how the human spirit allows us to overcome these differences.''.

VHurricane Nate brought a burst of flooding and power outages to the U.S. Gulf Coast before weakening rapidly Sunday, sparing the region the kind of catastrophic damage left by a series of hurricanes that hit the southern U.S. and Caribbean in recent weeks. Nate \u2014 the first hurricane to make landfall in Mississippi since Katrina in 2005 \u2014 quickly lost strength, with its winds diminishing to a tropical depression as it pushed northward into Alabama and toward Georgia with heavy rain. It was a Category 1 hurricane when it came ashore outside Biloxi early Sunday, its second landfall after initially hitting southeastern Louisiana on Saturday evening. The storm surge from the Mississippi Sound littered Biloxi\u2019s main beachfront highway with debris and flooded a casino\u2019s lobby and parking structure overnight. By dawn, however, Nate\u2019s receding floodwaters didn\u2019t reveal any obvious signs of widespread damage in the city where Hurricane Katrina had leveled thousands of beachfront homes and businesses. No storm-related deaths or injuries were immediately reported. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant praised state and local officials and coastal residents for working together to avoid loss of life. Lee Smithson, director of the state emergency management agency, said damage from Nate was held down in part because of work done and lessons learned from Katrina. \u201cIf that same storm would have hit us 15 years ago, the damage would have been extensive and we would have had loss of life.\u201d Smithson said of Nate. \u201cBut we have rebuilt the coast in the aftermath of Katrina higher and stronger.\u201d. Nate knocked out power to more than 100,000 residents in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida, but crews were working on repairs. As of Sunday afternoon, Alabama Power said more than 62,000 customers remained without power, while utilities and cooperatives in Mississippi said more than 21,000 were without electricity. In Louisiana, there were scattered outages during the storm, while Florida Gov. Rick Scott said 6,800 customers had lost power in his state. Mississippi\u2019s Gulf Coast casinos got approval to reopen in midmorning after closing Saturday as the storm approached. Sean Stewart, checking on his father\u2019s sailboat at a Biloxi marina after daybreak, found another boat had sunk, its sail still fluttering in Nate\u2019s diminishing winds. Stewart was relieved to find his father\u2019s craft intact. \u201cI got lucky on this one,\u201d he said. Before Nate sped past Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula late Friday and entered the Gulf of Mexico, it drenched Central America with rains that left at least 22 people dead. But Nate didn\u2019t approach the intensity of Harvey, Irma and Maria \u2014 powerful storms that left behind massive destruction during 2017\u2019s exceptionally busy hurricane season. \u201cWe are thankful because this looked like it was going to be a freight train barreling through the city,\u201d said Vincent Creel, a spokesman for the city of Biloxi. The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said the four hurricanes that have struck the U.S. and its territories this year have \u201cstrained\u201d resources, with roughly 85 percent of the agency\u2019s forces deployed. \u201cWe\u2019re still working massive issues in Harvey, Irma, as well as the issues in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and now this one,\u201d FEMA Administrator Brock Long told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d. The federal government declared emergencies in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Nate initially made landfall Saturday evening in Louisiana, but fears that it would overwhelm the fragile pumping system in New Orleans proved to be unfounded. The storm passed to the east of New Orleans, and Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on the city known for its all-night partying. \u201cHurricane Nate had the potential to wreak havoc on Louisiana, but thankfully, we were largely spared major damage,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement. In Alabama, Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier said he woke up around 3 a.m. Sunday to discover knee-deep water in his yard. Although some homes and cars on the island had flooded, Collier said he hadn\u2019t heard of anyone needing rescue. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it would be quite that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of snuck up on us in the wee hours of the morning.\u201d. At landfall in Mississippi, the fast-moving storm had maximum sustained winds near 85 mph (140 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Nate steadily weakened after its first landfall in a sparsely populated area of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. At 5 p.m. EDT, the center of Nate was about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Nashville, Tennessee. Nate was expected to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians through Monday. The Ohio Valley, central Appalachians and Northeast could also get heavy rain before the storm exits Maine on Tuesday. Biloxi city employees worked before dawn to clear Highway 90, where sand, logs and even a large trash bin had been washed onto the four-lane, beachfront road. Despite the debris, there was little to no visible damage to structures. A handful of businesses had reopened before dawn, and the storm surge that washed across the highway had receded by 6 a.m. Mississippi DOT crews had to remove over 1,000 pumpkins blown onto Highway 90 in Pass Christian, west of Gulfport. Willie Cook, 75, spent his morning chopping down a pecan tree that fell in his backyard. He said Nate was nothing like Katrina, which pushed 8 feet (2.4 meters) of water into his east Biloxi house. \u201cThe wind was blowing, but it wasn\u2019t too rough,\u201d Cook said of Nate. Storm surge flooded the parking structure of the Golden Nugget casino and several others in Biloxi. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn said about 1,100 people spent the night in shelters. \u201cThankfully, right now we have no major damage reports,\u201d he said. Hancock County Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Adam said Nate\u2019s storm surge flooded low-lying roads, but he hadn\u2019t heard any reports of flooded homes. \u201cWe turned out fairly good,\u201d he said as he prepared to survey neighborhoods. In Alabama, the storm flooded homes and cars on the coast and inundated at least one major road in downtown Mobile. At sunrise in Pensacola Beach, Florida, a small front-end loader scraped sand off a parking lot and returned it to the nearby beach. On Saturday night, about 6 inches of salt water began flowing through Anthony Perez\u2019s garage and a ground-level room of his Pensacola Beach condo along Santa Rosa Sound. The entire building was still surrounded by water on Sunday morning. \u201cI went downstairs and said, \u2018Uh! There it is! It\u2019s already flowing through,\u201d\u2019 Perez said. Officials rescued five people from two sailboats in choppy waters before the storm \u2014 two people from a sailboat in Lake Pontchartrain and three who were in the water after a boat hit rocks in the Mississippi Sound.

Alia Bhatt. Alia Bhatt has become well known for effortlessly showcasing designer gowns on the red carpet. She\u2019s featured on our Best Dressed lists many times. But now, the Udta Punjab star shows us she can also don fashionable, casual attire. She decided to make her outfit cool and fresh as she attended the 19th Mumbai Film Festival.

She dons a pair of pink, strappy heels to her outfit. Keeping things simple, Alia ties her hair in a plain bun and wears no jewellery. But she does add warm makeup; coral blush and rosy lipstick to accentuate her romantic look. An outstanding star to feature amongst our top picks!. Sara Ali Khan. Sara Ali Khan will soon make her Bollywood debut by featuring in Kedarnath, alongside Sushant Singh Rajput. Over the weekend, fans received a first glimpse of the stunning starlet\u2019s look with this image. Wearing vibrant colours and floral graphics, Sara gets top marks from us. She wears a beautiful dress, decorated with yellow, floral patterns and hues of pastel green. Around her neck, the actress adorns a jade scarf, complementing the dress wonderfully. But we absolutely love Sara\u2019s accessories. She matches a pair of silver earrings with various colourful bracelets. While one hand carries a wooden basket, Sara also covers herself from the glowing Sun with a gorgeous umbrella. Depicting a blue background with pink, floral designs, the accessory matches well with Sara\u2019s look. Will we see more of Sara\u2019s enchanting outfits in Kedarnath? We certainly hope so!. Parineeti Chopra. Parineeti Chopra looked utterly incredible when she shared this image with fans over the weekend. Donning a traditional outfit, the star carries sophistication and elegance.

Created with a dark turquoise material, it contains regal embellishments on the cuffs and shoulders. To make a bigger statement, Parineeti adds a glamorous, gold choker necklace. The star also lets her hair down in loose waves, highlighting her chestnut locks. For makeup, she wears a pastel pink lip, with memorising smokey eyeshadow and mascara. Karan Johar. Another fashion icon to grace our list for the weekend fashion. Filmmaker Karan Johar was another attendee of the Mumbai Film Festival, joining Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor. The director decided to combine the classic suit with updated, quirky twists to create a lavish look. He dons an all-black ensemble; pairing a blazer and trousers with a simple, black shirt. But we\u2019re impressed with the yellow horizontal stripes, decorating Karan\u2019s cuffs and collar. A much-needed splash of colour, making the suit vibrant. Karan is known for wearing intriguing, fashionable shoes; this hails as no exception. Check out the sleek, trendy embellishments on Karan\u2019s Louboutin footwear!. Neha Dhupia. Neha Dhupia enters into our list for the weekend fashion with this luxurious lehenga. The starlet has faced a rough year when it comes to fashion, following an unflattering outfit at the IIFA Rocks 2017. But now, she\u2019s impressed us by wearing a magnificent Anamika Khanna creation. A black base, it contains memorising, shimmering embellishments. With gold panelling and a low, round, neckline, Neha exudes glamour and sophistication. She adds a cream dupatta, finished with black stripes down its length. For her hair, Neha ties it up into a stylish bun with side locks framing her face. Finishing the regal look, the actress wears a rosy, red lip alongside creamy brown eyeshadow. After gazing through our captivating top picks for the weekend fashion, we\u2019re left impressed by their stylish outfits. Especially with Alia Bhatt and Sara Ali Khan\u2019s elegant, romantic creations. Neha and Parineeti also stole our hearts with their memorising, traditional looks. With the right combination of outfit, accessories and makeup, they showed us how to rule the fashion game. We also can\u2019t forget Karan Johar and his impeccable taste. With trendy footwear and twists on old classics, the director knows how to pull off daring choices. With so many enchanting looks to brighten our Monday, we can\u2019t wait to see who will feature in our next edition!.

VLhasa: Seven tourists were fined for chasing Tibetan antelopes in a national reserve in Tibet. The regional forestry authority said on Monday that the tourists in two off-road vehicles left the designated travel route and chased a herd of Tibetan antelopes in Serling Co National Nature Reserve in Nagqu Prefecture last week, reports Xinhua news agency. Pic courtesy: Web/gov.cn. Forestry wardens seized their video footage, which recorded over one minute of the chasing. The tourists involved said they had wanted to get a closer look at the antelope.  Zhaxi Doje, an official with the Tibet Forestry Bureau, said frightened Tibetan antelope running on top speed can suffer heart and lung failure. The tourists were fined 105,000 yuan ($16,000) in total for "disturbing rare wildlife's living and breeding".  The population of Tibetan antelope declined sharply from 200,000 to 20,000 due to illegal hunting in the 1980s. Thanks to the habitat protection in the past decade, the population has recovered but the species is still listed among China's first class protected animals. .

VShameful. In a gruesome incident that has come to light on Monday, a Nigerian national was allegedly tied to a post and beaten mercilessly in South Delhi's Malviya Nagar and all of it was caught on camera. Reports suggest residents in the area claiming that he was caught trying to rob a house in the area, after which he was beaten up by residents of the area. A video of the incident shows the man pleading for forgiveness as a he is beaten with what looks like a rod. At one point in the video one can see a man holding up the man's feet while another person hits him on his feet with a rod. NDTV reports that the victim was allegedly caught inside the home of Krishna Kumar and Kumar's neighbours claimed that he fell while trying to escape. The report says that he was handed over to the police in a badly wounded state. The police have told the news channel that action will be taken against the attackers based on evidence from the video. The video posted by NDTV India shows how badly the man was attacked:. There have been several such incidents against people from African nations in the national capital region. Students, belonging from African countries, were beaten up in several areas of NCR in March after residents of a Greater Noida society had alleged that a group of African student living there had kidnapped and drugged a teenager who later died. A raging mob had beaten up helpless students in Greater Noida's Ansal Plaza mall. The African Heads of Mission posted in New Delhi had strongly condemned the attacks and had called them "xenophobic and racial in nature". A statement issued after a meeting of the envoys following the incident and dated March 31 said: "As regards the recent unfortunate incident in Greater Noida, the African Heads of Mission strongly condemn the incident and express their deep concern and also take note that these reprehensible events both outstanding and unresolved cases against Africans, were not sufficiently condemned by the Indian authorities. The meeting unanimously agreed that those re-accumulated attacks against Africans are xenophobic and racial in nature.".

V Finally . Being one of the models of the moment in 2017 means expanding your horizons beyond the world behind the camera lens and diving into collaborations, designing and brand launching all at once, just ask Gigi Hadid. 22-year-old Hadid just announced that after a year, her first line of cosmetics is due to land on beauty counters very soon. How is this all happening? Well, Maybelline has finally tapped their campaign face to start her own diffusion line, aptly named, GigixMaybelline. A year in the making.. #GIGIxMAYBELLINE COMING SOON. @maybelline \U0001f98b\U0001f484\u2728. A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Oct 8, 2017 at 9:17am PDT. From the looks of what we\u2019ve glimpsed so far, GigixMaybelline already has a nude and iridescent colour scheme, plus a wearable nude lip and a coral blush amongst the offering. The line is set to be released in October in the US so fingers crossed Australia will be set for the same. This article originally appeared on Vogue.com.au.

VWine country is burning. Thousands of residents of Napa Valley, Sonoma and six other counties have been forced from their homes \u2013 and thousands more are preparing to flee \u2013 as 14 wildfires tear through Northern California, resisting fire fighters\u2019 efforts to contain them. California\u2019s fire chief says at least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings have been destroyed \u2013 and officials said that estimate was probably conservative. While no deaths have been confirmed, fire officials say numerous residents have been injured and a number of people are also missing. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott say an estimated 20,000 people have been evacuated. Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for Sonoma, Napa and Yuba counties, revealing that FEMA had approved emergency grants to help the state combat the fires. More than 20,000 people have been forced to evacuate, state officials said. #BREAKING: Gov. Jerry Brown announces State of Emergency for Napa, Sonoma and Yuba Counties. due to fires pic.twitter.com/Yvd75jt4IZ. \u2014 KPIX 5 (@CBSSF) October 9, 2017. As the LA Times reported, fire-friendly weather conditions converged prior to the outbreak of fires, which originated primarily in Sonoma and Napa. The Santa Ana winds - strong, extremely dry down-slope winds that occur mainly in the fall and originate inland in desert regions \u2013 were one factor in helping the fires spread. Warm temperatures also create the dry conditions that have helped the blazes spread like\u2026well\u2026wildfire. \u201cThis is really serious, it\u2019s moving fast. The heat, the lack of humidity and the winds are all driving a very dangerous situation and making it worse,\u201d the governor said at a morning press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not under control by any means. But we\u2019re on it in the best way we know how.\u201d. In Santa Rosa, the capital of Sonoma county, whole neighborhoods have been evacuated and 200 patients have been moved from area hospitals, the Associated Press reported. Smoke plumes from the fires showed up on the NWS radar\u2026.

Smoke wafted down to the Bay Area, but the Marin County Fire Department confirmed that there were no fires in that part of the state. Further south in Anaheim Hills, a 25-acre brush fire broke out Monday, forcing some residents to evacuate, NBC reported. Firefighters said they were concerned about embers drifting on strong winds into nearby neighborhoods. Thick smoke billowed over the freeways and the communities of Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills. October is historically one of the most dangerous months of the year when it comes to wildfires in California. Four of the state's five most-destructive fire occurred in October, including the 1991 Oakland Hill firestorms that resulted in 25 fatalities and burned 2,900 buildings. The Lake and Mendocino County Sheriffs ordered evacuations. The sheriff in Butte County said there were two fires in the area and ordered mandatory evacuations in several neighborhoods. Belia Ramos, the chairwoman of the Napa County board of supervisors, said the county was trying to contain three main fires, one of which is threatening more than 10,00 acres in Northern Napa County, another that is threatening between 8,000 to 12,000 acres, and a third that has affected some 2,00 acres. The fires were moving swiftly and in unpredictable paths through densely populated areas. California struggled with wildfires during the summer, including a blaze late last month that forced 1,000 people in Southern California to evacuate. Both AT&T and Verizon confirmed that their customers may be currently experiencing outages. "A power and connectivity issue is causing a service interruption in parts of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties," Verizon Wireless Pacific market public relations manager Heidi Flato said. "Our engineers are aware of this issue and are working with our vendor partners to resolve this issue quickly.". PG&E is also reporting power outages, mostly in the Sonoma area, due to the fire, according to SFGate.

VCricket\u2019s world body, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is set to approve plans for the World Test Championship at a meeting in New Zealand this week, reports suggested on Monday. The Sydney Morning Herald, on Monday, reported that plans for a nine-nation Test championship were under way and the ICC was set to give the concept a green light on Friday at a meeting in Auckland. According to AFP, the report stated that the first edition of the competition would run over a two-year cycle beginning in 2019, culminating in a final between the top two teams at Lord's. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said the league competition would give Test series a broader international "context", making them more than stand-alone bilateral contests. "You're also creating structure in such a way that you no longer have games without meaning. They are all part of a league championship," he told the Herald. A recent innovation designed to reverse the trend is the introduction of day-night Test matches, which moves playing sessions to more spectator-friendly hours. The idea of four-day Test matches has also been floated, although traditionalists oppose the move. With an eye on attracting more crowds and increased TV viewership, the ICC had for years been pitching the idea of a Twenty20 version of the game. But since 2010, disagreements over format of the league and other matters saw the delay in the league taking off. The Herald also reported that the ICC will also look at a major shake-up of one-day international fixtures at the Auckland meeting. It said a 13-nation ODI league was being considered, which would operate on a three-year cycle with results affecting World Cup qualification. Under the plans, the number of ODIs in a series would be capped at three, ending the lengthy five-match series that are currently part of the international fixture list.

VThe system, dubbed CornerCameras, can detect moving objects hidden around corners.  In spy novels and superhero films, the ability to see through walls has always been a handy \u2014 not to mention, impressive \u2014 trick. And now, this tech could be available to people in real life, with smartphone cameras that can help detect moving objects even if they are hidden around corners, according to a new study.  This futuristic-sounding tech could one day help vehicles see around blind corners, the researchers said.  "We may eventually be able to use this idea to alert drivers to pedestrians or cars that are about to dart out from behind buildings into a driver's path. Perhaps a few seconds of notice could save lives," said study lead author Katie Bouman, an imaging scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[Mind-Controlled Cats?! 6 Incredible Spy Technologies That Are Real].  "Search and rescue, or helping to understand what is going on behind a wall in a hostage situation, are also potential applications," Bouman added.  Researchers have taken many different approaches in trying to make the "superpower" of seeing around corners a reality. For example, in 2015, researchers showed they could use lasers to see objects around corners by firing light pulses at surfaces near the items. Those surfaces could act like mirrors, scattering the laser pulses onto any hidden objects. By analyzing the light that was reflected off the objects and other surfaces back onto the scanners, researchers could reconstruct the shapes of the hidden items.  Although most strategies for seeing around corners "are really great ideas," they also "usually require complex modeling [or] specialized hardware, or are computationally expensive," Bouman told Live Science. The 2015 study's technique, for example, required both extremely fast lasers and extraordinarily sensitive cameras.  But Bouman and her colleagues' method for seeing around corners simply uses a smartphone camera.  "We use light naturally in the scene and do not have to introduce our own light to probe the hidden scene," Bouman said. "This allows us to use common consumer cameras and not specialized equipment to see around corners.".  The new system, known as CornerCameras, analyzes light that is reflected off objects hidden around corners and that falls on the ground within the line of sight of the camera. This light is called the "penumbra.". The system works by analyzing light at the edge of walls, which is impacted by the reflections of objects around the corner from the camera.  The system analyzes this penumbra over several seconds, stitching together dozens of distinct images, according to the study. This data helps the system measure the speed and trajectory of objects around corners in real time. (It does not see any identifying details about those objects \u2014 just the fact that they are moving.).  "I think the biggest surprise was that the system worked well in situations that I would not have expected," Bouman said. "For instance, once, during filming, it started raining. This caused big raindrops to start appearing on the ground, changing the color of the concrete floor.".  Because CornerCameras is trying to analyze light signals that are just 0.1 percent of the total brightness of the ground, "I thought these raindrops would wipe out any signal we had," Bouman said. However, CornerCameras analyzes the data of a scene across dozens of images, so "the effect of the raindrops was essentially averaged out.".  One current limitation of CornerCameras is that it requires a stationary camera that's held very steady. "In many situations, such as in a collision-avoidance system on a car, you do not have the luxury of a stationary camera," Bouman said. The researchers are now focused on getting the system to work first on a moving wheelchair and eventually on a moving car, she said.  Future research will also aim to make CornerCameras work in a variety of lighting situations, or in changing lighting conditions, such as when clouds overhead constantly move in front of the sun. "Getting the system to work in these scenarios would open up the possibility of it being able to be used by a person with a handheld smartphone," Bouman said.  Bouman and her colleagues will detail their findings on Oct. 25 at the International Conference on Computer Vision in Venice, Italy.

VNagpur: The state's chief wildlife warden, AK Misra, on Monday evening, issued fresh orders to shoot the problem tigress of Bor. After a journey of around 200km, the tigress is moving towards Garamsur near Bor Tiger Reserve again. The high court said the order did not reflect efforts to tranquillize the tigress and NTCA SOP was not followed. . This is the third order issued since June 23 to shoot the tigress. The fresh order states, "Notwithstanding the order to shoot the tigress, all efforts shall be taken to trap and tranquillize the tigress.". However, the court had granted liberty to issue fresh orders. Accordingly, Misra issued fresh order on Monday under Section 11(2) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 to shoot the tigress. The order reflects report of the hurriedly constituted seven-member committee under Nagpur deputy conservator G Mallikarjuna. The first order was issued on June 23 which was challenged by wildlife lover Dr Jerryl Banait through PIL. The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had stayed the order on June 29. The second order was issued on October 4 and it was withdrawn on October 6 after the forest department failed to defend its action before a double bench of justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi. The report states that in South Bramhapuri, the tigress had mauled two villagers and injured 4 people in six incident. After it was captured and released in Bor Tiger Reserve on July 29, it has killed two persons and injured one.

VRichard Thaler (Pic courtesy: Chicago Booth website).  US academic Richard Thaler, who helped popularise the idea of "nudging" people towards doing what was best for them, won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize on Monday for his work on how human nature affects supposedly rational markets.  Influential in the field of behavioural economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.  "I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that," Thaler, a professor at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.  Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: "Richard Thaler's contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making." "His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioural economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.".  Thaler brought to prominence the idea of "nudge" economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviours without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.  In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year's resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.  The issue has relevance for economics as individuals' tendency to fall prey to temptations often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.  Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.  Their book, titled 'Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness' became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters' wrath for raising taxes or banning behaviour outright.  "This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of 'nudging' ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making," Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.  "Not only in the United States - there's also a nudging unit for the UK government, there's one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.".  MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN.  The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel's 1895 will.  Economy is the last of this year's Nobels. The prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were all awarded last week.  The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.  While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single women won any Nobel award in 2017.  Asked about the disparity, the Academy's secretary general Goran Hansson said they were concerned about the issue and planned a conference with all nominators to discuss it.  "Consider this a request for all nominators to also consider female scientists who have made contributions," he said.  While few economists are household names, past winners have included Milton Friedman, in 1976, whose work is a cornerstone of current monetary policy, and James Tobin, in 1981, who proposed countries should tax financial transactions.

V Following his elbow injury, Novak Djokovic is set to return in January to open his campaign in Australia. Djokovic\u2019s team confirmed in a press conference that Andre Agassi would return as the head coach for the 2018 season. The 12-time grand slam champion failed to get past the quarterfinals in any grand slam. Dennis Istomin stunned him in the second round of the Australian Open. Djokovic also had to retire in the quarters of the Wimbledon, against Tomas Berdych. He also had an unimpressive run in the French Open. Novak Djokovic will look to regain his position in the top ten as he returns to the courts in January, with Andre Agassi spearheading his team. Agassi Stays. After severing ties with long time coach Marian Vajda and Boris Becker, Djokovic has looked to settle in with the American Andre Agassi. The duo will restart where they left off last season, after Djokovic returns from his injury woes. Djokovic stated in a press conference that he has spent several days in Belgrade for some fitness training. The Serbian is hoping that he will recover in time to take part in the Australian open in January. It remains to be seen if Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray\u2019s return to competitive tennis will be as impressive Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal\u2019s. The Swiss and the Spaniard, who after similar injury issues, returned to share the grand slams his year.

VBefore we can journey to the stars, we must first go to Mars. That\u2019s Elon Musk\u2019s philosophy, anyways \u2013 and as Visual Capitalist's Jeff Desjardins reports, just days ago he revealed new details on his ambitions to colonize the Red Planet, including sending two cargo rockets by 2022 and four rockets (two manned, two cargo) by 2024. In 40 to 100 years, Musk suggested that up to a million people could live there. CHANGE OF SEASONS. As Elton John wisely noted, \u201cMars ain\u2019t the kind of place to raise your kids\u201d. Indeed, the average temperature on Mars is \u221255 °C (\u221267 °F), dust storms are frequent and potentially deadly, and the planet has extremely low atmospheric pressure (about 1% of Earth). Because of the atmosphere and temperature swings, meaningful occurrences of liquid water on the planet\u2019s surface are almost impossible. And while Mars is thought to have plenty of frozen water at its poles and in underground deposits, the logistics of tapping into these resources could be quite difficult. In other words, for any meaningful and long-lasting human presence on Mars, we would likely want to alter the planet and its atmosphere to make it more habitable for human life. And while the exact mechanisms we would use to accomplish this are still up for debate, the basics behind what\u2019s needed to achieve Earth-like conditions are actually pretty straightforward. TERRAFORMING 101. Today\u2019s infographic comes to us from Futurism, and it details what might need to happen on Mars to make it more accommodating to human life. Here are two steps we could take to get Mars into the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d, where water is liquid \u2013 and harmful ionizing radiation like x-rays, UV rays, and gamma rays are not problematic. Greenhouse Gases. One way to ward off harmful ionizing radiation is to add a thicker layer of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere of Mars. Such an atmosphere would also allows less heat to escape, meaning warmer temperatures on the planet. Magnetic Field. A strong magnetic field on Earth is something else that makes life easier. Earth\u2019s solid inner core, composed primarily of iron, creates this field when the planet spins \u2013 and it deflects cosmic rays and other harmful types of radiation. One interesting solution to solve this problem on Mars would to have a magnetic field generator in front of the planet at all times, deflecting any such rays coming from the sun. THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY. While terraforming is still a mixture of theory and science fiction at this point, we do know some of the major problems that have to be solved for attaining a habitable environment \u2013 and it will be interesting to see how plans around Mars develop as the prospect of colonization becomes more real. You need to live in a dome initially but over time you could terraform Mars to look like Earth and eventually walk around outside without anything on. \u2026 So it\u2019s a fixer-upper of a planet. \u2013 Elon Musk.

V MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday dared his party's ruling ally BJP to "resign" from the Maharashtra government and face midterm polls. .  He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his "campaign" for upcoming Gujarat assembly polls. .  "I challenge you (the BJP) to resign from the government and face polls once again. We will show you the might of the Shiv Sena. Even during the (Modi) wave, BJP got votes in the name of Sena," Thackeray said, addressing a local poll rally in Nanded. .  Nanded-Waghala Municipal Corporation (NWMC) polls are scheduled for October 11. .  Taking a dig at Modi, Thackeray said people were now forwarding a joke on social media that the prime minister of India 'may visit India soon', apparently referring to Modi's frequent foreign tours. .  "I was watching news on television. Saw the PM campaigning for Gujarat polls that are two-months away. How did he suddenly remember his school today after being in power for three years? Did he not feel like visiting his school ever before? Why just before the polls?" he questioned. .  Modi today visited Vadnagar, his birth place in north Gujarat, first time since he became the prime minister. He also visited his school. .  The Sena chief further said his father late Bal Thackeray taught him to never tell a lie to people or wear a "mask" (being a hypocrite) and that he has been following it. .  "You (the PM) are making an announcement that you have given a Diwali gift to the people by slashing GST rates. Come here to Nanded and visit the homes of farmers. You will know if it is Diwali or 'Diwala' (poverty) for them," he said. .  Modi had yesterday said Diwali arrived early for the people, a day after the GST Council announced changes in Goods and Servics Tax, slashing rates on more than 25 products and providing relief to small and medium businesses. .  However, the Sena chief said, "Farmers are burdened with debts. Now, like development, even electricity is nowhere to be seen due to a shortage of coal." .  He also asked how many rich people stood in the queues after demonetisation. "Lakhs of people lost their jobs but terrorism did not cease. Farmers lost their money kept in cooperative banks," he said. .  He asked the gathering if they would vote for a party that "ordered" lathicharge on women students in Banaras Hindu University in Uttar Pradesh, a BJP-ruled state, when they complained against eve teasing. .  Thackeray further said that people voted for Nitish Kumar in Bihar for development, despite Modi's financial package of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for the state. "What Nitish Kumar later did is another issue." .  Taking a dig at Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, he said that while he may speak of "invisible hands" supporting the BJP, the Sena voices its criticism openly. .  "We do not know how to hide and work. We openly criticise if something is wrong. Sharad Pawar's NCP may continue to remain the invisible hands supporting you," he said. .  He added that Fadnavis, during the Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Corporation polls, had promised a huge financial package but nobody knew what happened to his promise. .

VWe love an ugly duckling story that ends with a beautiful new layout. Don't let previous owners' questionable decor choices stand in the way of your dream kitchen. These total transformations prove that some white paint and new lighting can erase even the biggest interior design sins. A maze-like first floor left Taylor Kaye's living, dining and kitchen areas dark and cramped. The TV personality recruited designer Jo Alcorn of Whitewash & Co. and engineer Yu Ching Lai of YCL Structural Designs to reconfigure the split-up space. .  BEFORE: Divided Layout. Knocking down walls \u2014 including one behind the stove \u2014 made the entire floor more airy, not to mention family-friendly. A new island with cabinets on both sides helps keep clutter at bay. See more of this makeover ».  AFTER: Sprawling Floor Plan. Victoria Hunt, interior designer at Ash Bradbury Design, was determined to fix up the cringe-worthy kitchen that mimicked an ugly Christmas sweater.  BEFORE: Neon Eyesore. To make the room feel airy, Hunt opened the space by pushing the counters to the edges of the room. She painted the walls in Benjamin Moore's Revere Pewter (a classic paint color designers often choose), which expands the room while offering delicate warmth and freshness. See more at Ash Bradbury Design ».  AFTER: Breathing Room. Tanya \u2014 the blogger behind Dans le Lakehouse \u2014 described her kitchen cabinets as "small and awkward.".  BEFORE: Awkward Storage Space. Open shelving isn't a risky choice when you have all that great bakeware to show off. "The lower cabinets were painted turquoise (to match my Pyrex collection, naturally)," Tanya wrote about the renovation. See more at Dans le Lakehouse ».  AFTER: Open (and Bright!) Shelving . Blogger Kaylor Little of Fisherman's Wife Furniture was stuck in a kitchen with builder-grade cabinets, simple laminate countertops and not-so-soothing lighting.  BEFORE: Harsh Lighting . The butcher block countertops (which Kaylor installed herself) and light blue glass backsplash subtly contrast with the white cabinets and stainless steel. See more at Fisherman's Wife Furniture ».  AFTER: Bright Surfaces. When Jen \u2014 the blogger behind Tatertots & Jello \u2014 bought a cute 1905 cottage, she knew she'd need big plans for its tiny kitchen.  BEFORE: Dated Space. New white cabinets and tile, a poppy yellow chandelier and a more open layout immediately brighten what was dingy before. See more at Tatertots & Jello ».  AFTER: Fresh Fixtures.

VPadmavati Trailer: Ranveer Singh Outshines Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor in the first promo. Shirtless pictures of Bollywood studs that are hot AF. The long wait to see Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer\u2019s Padmavati trailer has finally come to an end. This morning the makers announced that the trailer of the film will be out at 13:03 pm and as expected it is out and it has left us speechless thanks to the grandeur and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s vision. The trailer was released at this time because it has a historical significance. It was in 1303 AD that Rawal Ratan Singh first fought with Alauddin Khilji, that is why the makers decided to digitally release the trailer at this time. The filmmaker surprised everyone as he unveiled the look of the three lead characters of his film. Deepika\u2019s look as Rani Padmini redefined royalty while Shahid Kapoor\u2019s Maharawal Ratan Singh look was impressive. But it was Ranveer Singh\u2019s menacing Sultan Alauddin Khilji avatar that we loved the most. The actor was unrecognisable in his new avatar. His long tresses, his kohl eyes and the scar, everything about his look was just too good. The actor will be seen in a negative role in the film for the very first time. While we were convinced that this will be probably the actor\u2019s best ever after seeing the poster, the trailer just left us awestruck. Watch it below:. Apart from Deepika, Shahid and Ranveer, the film also features Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh and Raza Murad in key roles. After a lot of delays, the film produced by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Bhansali Productions will finally hit theatres on December 1. After watching the trailer of Padmavati, it seems a long wait for us. What about you? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!.

VA special lighting system for the famous Central Vista \u2014 comprising the iconic North and South Block buildings of the Indian government - with 16 million colour combinations, displaying a wide range of patterns and themes during night with colours changing every few seconds will be inaugurated on Wednesday, an official statement said on Sunday. Representative Image. Reuters. With the investment of Rs 15.40 crore, the new lighting will be on show from 7 pm to 5 am all through the year with full capacity prime time lighting from 8 pm to 9 pm. Installed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), under the Urban Development Ministry, the new dynamic façade, lighting over an area of 21,450 square metres of the two famed buildings, will have 25 percent electrical load during 7 to 7.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. while the load will be 50 percent during the remainder of the night. The new lighting will be switched on by the senior-most support staff of the Home Ministry, Mahipal Singh, on Wednesday at 6.30 am. The present famed special lighting, which covers an area of 16,750 square metres, on eight select days in a year and a few hour every night façade lighting of the North and South block buildings, will move from being static to dynamic, said the statement. "The entire network of new dynamic lighting, using the state of the art RGB LED technology with 40 kms of unified power and data cabling, has central computerized control with an automated selection of colour combinations. It also has the technology of selection of timing, dimming and switching on and off facility, individual and combined control of light fittings through Ethernet-based controller," it said. It has a multitude of advantages over the present conventional special lighting show on special occasions like Independence Day and the Republic Day and some national festivals and façade lighting, it said. "The lights and fixtures are more durable, cost-effective, energy efficient and environmentally friendly.". "The annual saving on account of new lighting of 21,450 square metres of façade area will be Rs 86.40 lakh. The life of the new LED light fittings is over one lakh burning hours, coming to about 25 years as against only 10,000 burning hours for the existing. "Energy consumption by the present limited conventional lighting using LED, Metal Halide and Sodium Vapour light fittings are Rs 17 lakhs per year, double that of the extended year-round new dynamic lighting with an energy consumption of only Rs 8.40 lakhs per year.". The new light fittings are dust, vermin and moisture proof with outdoor weather protection of the highest order (IP-66) with robust design, the statement said. "The CPWD informed the Ministry that the initial investment of Rs 15.40 crore for the new lighting will be recovered in just six to seven years and thereafter the system becoming virtually free of cost as against the costs being incurred every year now.". Under the present lighting system, 50,000 three watt LED bulbs in strings nailed on the walls of the iconic buildings are being used for special lighting on eight occasions in a year besides 170 lamps of 400 MW or 250 MW Metal Halide and Sodium Vapour for façade lighting and 72 LED lights for security lighting. "The new dynamic lighting system with 800 fittings will do away with all of these," it said.

VHello IMBBians,. I love sachet masks. Recently, I ran out of them and decided to pick up one and spotted the Rose Otto range and picked up some from them. Today\u2019s review is all about Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask. So read on to know more. Price and Quantity: $11.75 for 125 ml.  Product Description:.  Bioactive Organic Rose Otto Oil is a rich hydrating and moisturizing essential oil with renowned skin toning properties. We combine this fragrant wonder oil with a proprietary blend of bioactive, natural and organic ingredients including mineral rich Kaolin (China Clay). This nutrient rich clay based formulation helps to draw oil from the pores while ridding the skins surface of dead cells and impurities. It also helps to stimulate the circulation deep into the capillaries to leave the skin toned and purified. Directions:.  Use twice weekly as part of your cleansing regime. Apply the face mask evenly over whole face avoiding eyes and lips. Relax for 10 minutes and allow drying, and then removing with warm water or a damp flannel.  Ingredients:.  Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, Aqua, Kaolin, Calcium carbonate, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea butter), Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) butter, Glycerin, Zinc oxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hectorite, Glyceryl caprylate, Decyl glucoside, Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus (Sunflower) seed oil, Pelargonium graveolens (Geranium) oil, Eugenia caryophyllata (Clove) flower oil, Rosa damascena (Rose) flower oil, Parfum, Rosa damascena (Rose) flower extract, Passiflora incarnata extract, Tilia europaea flower extract, Calendula officinalis flower extract, Chamomilla recutita flower extract, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, Sodium phytate, Citric acid, Ascorbic acid, Geraniol, Linalool, Citronellol, Eugenol. My Experience with Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:. The mask comes in a cardboard package. There is all the information you need on the package. The mask comes in a white tube package with a white flip cap. The design is similar to the products from the Rose Otto range. The flip cap is not very tight and doesn\u2019t close with a click. But, it closes well and there is no leakage. The product is travel-friendly and the sleek package makes it easier to carry around in the bag. The mask gets dispensed very well from the tube. Since it contains clay, there are chances that it dries around the nozzle, so I usually clean up the area after usage. The mask is white, rich and creamy. It is white in color. The consistency is more like a cream than a mask. It smells delicious of roses and very similar to the other one available in the range. . You can use the mask with a hand or a brush, I prefer a brush for even and easy application. Let it dry while you relax for around 10-15 minutes and then wash off with water or a damp towel. Using water creates a mess and it is difficult to remove the dried mask, so I recommend using a damp towel and then wash off the remaining residue with water. . The product dries up pretty fast; however, it doesn\u2019t stretch the skin like the traditional Kaolin masks. After washing off, the skin feels very soft and smooth. The skin feels so supple. The mask does remove the dead skin and fills the skin with moisture. The mask is said to be hydrating, but I find it a bit drying and a moisturizer is a must to be followed up. . The product doesn\u2019t cause any breakouts nor does it irritate the skin. The product makes the skin cleansed and adds radiance to the skin. The product also dries out the pimples, which is great! The product does control oiliness on the skin. The product makes the skin toned. The product does rejuvenate the skin and makes the skin beautiful. . The product is free from paraben, SLS and artificial colors or preservatives. The mask is great but, it is a normal kaolin mask and I have used inexpensive ones from Balea that offers the same results, so I might not repurchase this again but till I have this, I would use it again and again. So summing up. Pros of Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:. Travel friendly.  Easy to use.  Thick, creamy consistency with amazing fragrance.  Doesn\u2019t irritate the skin.  Doesn\u2019t pull the skin when drying.  Skin feels very soft and supple.  Removes dead skin.  Controls oil and shine on the face.  Adds radiance.  Makes skin tones.  Dries the pimples and p[prevents breakouts.  Free from paraben, SLS and artificial colors or preservatives. Cons of Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask:. Skin feels dry after use and a moisturizer is a must.  A normal kaolin mask and same effects can be achieved with inexpensive ones. IMBB Rating: 4/5.  Would I Repurchase/Recommend Dr Organic Rose Otto Face Mask? .  Yes to both! .  Overall rating:   0  out of 5 based on  0  reviews.  .

V Hyderabad: Premier industry and trade body Ficci secretary general Sanjaya Baru on Monday said that the Union government must work with state governments to restore a sense of confidence among domestic investors to boost private investments in the country. Baru, who was also the media advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, pointed out that the private sector is not investing adequately due to lack of confidence and a sense of "insecurity". "The decrease in investment rate in the country from 35% to 29% is largely on account of decline in private investments...for several reasons...one of them being that many of the large firms are over-leveraged. It is extremely important for the government to come out and say that when a businessman makes a mistake, it can be a genuine honest mistake ... every mistake is not a product of dishonesty. There are criminal businessmen, they loot banks and siphon money out of India. Arrest them... arrest Vijay Mallya but every businessman, who has made a wrong investment is not a criminal... After all investment is an act of risk taking," Baru said while delivering a talk on 'Current State of Economic Affairs' at Ftapcci here. He also added that though the country has moved away from licence raj, it has moved towards 'regulation raj', wherein excessive regulations are causing a lot of inconvenience. Businessmen are more comfortable investing outside India or holding back investments as they are not confident about the future of their investments in the country, he said. He said to restore confidence the need of the hour is change of mind-set, especially in the government, where they start seeing the business community as nation builders and not view them with suspicion. Baru was quick to add that unless the investors within the country do not invest in the country, it will be difficult to convince foreign investors to pump money into India. Another major issue, Baru said was that whatever little investments are flowing in the country are coming to states such as Gujarat, NCR, AP and Telangana, which are already developed and no one is willing to invest in areas like North East, Odisha, West Bengal or Bihar, which actually need investments. .

VSalman Khan has been the host of the show 'Bigg Boss' since 2010 (Photo Credits: Facebook). After a controversial Saturday (October 7), the second edition of Weekend Ka Vaar on Sunday (October 8) with Salman Khan was much lighter. The host of the show was joined by the team of Golmaal Again, who were present to promote their upcoming Diwali release. On Sunday, The Dabangg Khan introduced a new segment to the episode titled \u201cSultani Akhada\u201d, where two contestants could confront each other based on the happenings of the week. In this episode Arshi Khan confronted Sapna Choudhary about their tiff that took place in the first week of their stay inside the house. Also, controversial contestant Zubair Khan left the house after his heated confrontation with the host, Salman. The reason was for his sudden departure from the show is because Zubair took an over dose of sleeping pills after his argument with the actor and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Salman furiously taught Zubair a lesson and accused him about his inappropriate behavior with his fellow contestants especially abusing the women contestants of the show. According to reports the contestant has filed an FIR against \u2018bhaijaan\u2019 for reportedly threatening to assault him once he is out of the house. Well, all the drama that took place on Saturday was put on hold, when the Sultan of Bollywood was joined by the team of Golmaal Again. The upcoming film\u2019s star cast including Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Arshad Warsi, Parineeti Chopra, Kunal Kemmu, Tushar Kapoor along with the director Rohit Shetty shared some light hearted moments with Salman. The film actors later entered the house to calm down the contestants\u2019 heated atmosphere after Zubair Khan\u2019s exit. Salman as the host of the show also informed the housemates that the \u2018padosis\u2019 will soon be a part of the house, and now the game will be more challenging for the housemates as a tough week awaits them. So far, Priyank Sharma and Zubair Khan have been evicted from the show, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see the course of twists and turns on the show now.

VLove, Sex Aur Dhokha: How JeM commander Khalid was killed by security forces. September Special: Check out 7 best places to visit in the month of September in India Jaish-e Mohammad Operational Head Khalid was gunned down on Monday. New Delhi, Oct 9: Top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander Umer Khalid was gunned down by a joint team of security forces in Ladoora area of north Kashmir\u2019s Baramulla town today. Khalid was a top ranked militant who carried a cash reward of nearly Rs 7 lakh on his head. Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police SP Vaid said it was a major breakthrough for the security forces as the militant was involved in many attacks on security camps in north Kashmir as well as targeting policemen in particular. According to reports, Khalid\u2019s girlfriend helped the security forces nab the dreaded terrorist. Khalid\u2019s Girlfriend Wanted Revenge. Some time last year, a woman walked into the office of a top Jammu and Kashmir Police officer\u2019s office. The woman claimed she was in a relationship with JeM commander Mohammad Khalid but wanted him dead as he has cheated her. \u201cI will lead you to his tracks, you do the rest (in killing him).

VNew Delhi: In the wake of recent crimes against students inside the school premises, the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre and the state governments to file safety guidelines for schools, while specifically keeping in mind that the children should not be in any phobia. The apex court also observed that when the safety guidelines are formed, a certain mechanism must be put in place. The top court has asked central and state governments to give their suggestions in this regard when the matter will be heard next on October 30. Following the brutal murder of a seven-year-old child in Ryan International School, a plea was earlier filed by two women lawyers, seeking implementation of existing guidelines to ensure safety and well-being of children in schools across the country. Hearing the plea on September 15, a bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Amitava Roy and A.M. Khanwilkar issued notices and sought the responses within three weeks from the Union Human Resources Ministry and all state governments and union territories.

VBharuch: "No matter how many corrupt people come together, it is honesty which is going to win at the end of everything," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday. The Prime Minister made this remark while addressing the people after laying the foundation stone of a barrage over the Narmada River and flagging of Antyodaya Express between Udhna in Surat and Jaynagar in Bihar on the second day of his visit to poll-bound Gujarat. Prime Minister Modi said it is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government which introduced the 100% neem coating of urea for the benefit of the farmers. "We decided that 100% neem coating of urea has to be done so that it can only be used in farming and not in chemical factories. Neem coating of urea helped farmers and stopped corruption as well as theft," he said. He also hit out at the former United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government at the Centre and said they never introduced this technique and only helped corrupt people to make money from the urea subsidised for the farmers. "Even the previous government knew about this technique but still they didn't do anything. They only allowed 30 % neem coating of urea and paved the way for corruption by leaving the rest. After this neem coating, the urea cannot be used in any factory except in farming," the Prime Minister said. "No matter how many corrupt people come together, at the end of everything it is the honesty that will win. Honesty can never be defeated," he added. Praising the Railway Ministry for their commendable initiative of introducing the Antyodaya Express, the Prime Minister said the new train will make it easier for people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to go home for the 'Chhath Puja'. Stressing on the necessity of water for survival, Prime Minister Modi assured that the barrage over Narmada River will be completed on time. "I assure you that this project will be completed on time and will solve the issue of water scarcity in the region," he said. He urged the fisherman to avail the benefit of the Centre's Blue Revolution programme. "I want to appeal to the fisherman to take maximum advantage of the initiative. We will provide boats to the fisherman, so that they can do fishing beyond 12 km nautical mile, cold storage facility is also available there," he said. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minsiter slammed the UPA Government over the health policy. He also launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush to accelerate the progress towards the goal of full immunisation coverage.

VThis new way of looking at cells is revolutionizing biochemistry. Before the invention of cryo-electron microscopy, which won biochemists Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday, scientists had to stain or fix cells before they looked at them under an electron microscope. That process often caused fragile biological structures to fall apart, and if they didn\u2019t, the radiation from the electron microscope or the vacuum the scientists put the cells into often turned the once-living specimens into mush. Cryo-electron therapy allows scientists to look at the cells as if they were in their natural liquid environment\u2014just like they are in our bodies. \u201cIn order to really understand how these proteins work and function, looking at their state in a liquid environment is critical,\u201d says Allison Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society. In 1975, Joachim Frank of the New York State Department of Health theorized a process in which the then-limited information that electron microscopes presented could be combined into a high resolution, 3-D image. He spent more than a decade creating algorithms for this software, which then made cryo-electron microscopy possible. Then in 1984, a team led by Jacques Dubochet published a paper using electron microscopy to image a virus that often causes the common cold, preserved in a thin layer of water cooled so quickly it became more like glass than ice. "The viral particles appear free from the kind of damage caused by dehydration, freezing or adsorption to a support that is encountered in preparing biological samples for conventional electron microscopy," writes the scientific team in the paper. "Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens offers possibilities for high resolution observations that compare favorably with any other electron microscopical method." In 1990, Richard Henderson published the first picture of a bacterial protein with high enough resolution to show every individual atom. Since then, scientists have used cry-electron microscopy to look at more than 100 molecules: the proteins that cause chili peppers to burn your mouth, Zika cells, the plaques associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to name just a few. Getting a more accurate and higher resolution image of these proteins will help scientists develop new drugs and other therapies to fight the diseases they cause. \u201cI wish that we would have had this when I was still active in research,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cThe potential has yet to be realized.\u201d.

VE-way bill to change pricing dynamics and formalize logistics ecosystem. The recently notified e-way bill can bring down road freight pricing meaningfully. This will coincide with the benefits of double stacking peaking at Concor, leading to volatility in its margin till the commissioning of DFC. Seen differently, the e-way bill will also set the stage for organized road players to gain their rightful share of business. The impact would be felt more on those servicing SMEs and others who invested in cost overheads, like VRL Logistics. Road freight pricing can come down meaningfully. Road freight pricing largely represents the dynamics of domestic cargo transportation and thus carries a premium without complying with inter-state taxation norms. There will be no such premium once the control mechanism in e-way bill gets implemented on October1, 2017. In addition, the true benefits of faster turnaround time would also be felt as the physical/mobile border check posts would become irrelevant. Such decline in pricing may impact Concor\u2019s margin/market share from October 2017. Although known but less appreciated, road pricing is a key determinant of the mark-up charged by rail container operators. CTOs have been able to grow margins by partly retaining the benefits of double-stacking. Material share of such benefits have been realized by CTOs against 8-10% cost savings potential as per our analysis prior to the DFC. With DFC being some years away, the interim margin trajectory would show volatility based on the potential drop in road freight pricing, uptick in exim trade and reduction in exim imbalance (all external factors of which one is playing in favor and two against as things stand today). We note recent buoyancy in business for rail volumes (up 12% yoy in August 2017), in line with the buoyancy in non-oil non-gems and jewellery exports (up 15% in August 2017). Such growth would be reflected even more in September 2017 rail container data before the real test comes from October 2017. Refer to the note for more details on near-term variables at play. VRL Logistics \u2013 A key beneficiary of a compliant system of transportation of domestic cargo. GST will lead to a shift of cargo movement to tax-compliant large-fleet operators. Coupled with improved productivity of commercial vehicles under GST, this would further increase the delta for organized players. Within the ecosystem, VRL Logistics stands out, having invested in cost overheads (hub-and-spoke network, large driver and owned CV base) to build a pan-India distribution network. Unlike other organized peers, it has done so without straining its balance sheet and is well-placed to gain market share from non-tax compliant small-fleet operators. E-way bill: a simple yet stringent approach to accounting in GST regime . All transactions on movement of manufactured goods beyond `50,000 in value would be required to raise an e- way bill on GST- Network (GSTN). This e-way bill would be initiated by a supplier/transporter/trader and will have to be verified by the receiver of such goods. Once the GSTN receives the e-way bill, it will generate an e- way bill number (EBN) and this will be provided to all related parties. This number will be valid for one day for a 100-km journey and one day each for each additional 100 km. The present lax system of checking enables unscrupulous consignors and transport agents/ common carriers to under-report transactions. This leads to mass tax avoidance, a business model for several manufacturers and transporters. The proposed draft rules tend to reduce leeway on this count markedly, in addition, the matching principle is at the heart of the GST system.

VCars steal the spotlight when it comes to electrification, but the motorcycle industry is undergoing a similar transformation. The gradual shifts towards zero emissions look a lot alike -- some actors are well ahead of the curve and pioneering a new niche in their respective segments, while others are unwillingly hopping on the bandwagon to keep up with the rest of the industry. Can\u2019t name an electric motorcycle? Don\u2019t worry, there aren\u2019t many options to choose from right now. That\u2019s set to change soon when major manufacturers like Harley-Davidson, KTM, Yamaha, and Honda come to the market with their own spin on the concept. Until then, here are the best electric motorcycles currently on sale in the United States. Alta Redshift MX. Alta explains the Redshift MX is the electric equivalent of a 250cc dirt bike. The 261-pound machine offers 40 horsepower and 120 pound-feet of torque from a compact, water-cooled electric motor. A water-proof lithium-ion battery pack provides enough electricity for up to two hours of riding, and the Redshift never needs an oil change. Pricing starts at $14,995. Alta Redshift SM. The Alta Redshift SM is to the track what the Redshift MX is to the trail. Both use the same 40-hp electric motor linked to a 5.8-kWh battery pack, but the SM is equipped with lights and turn signals so it can be driven on the street. It has just 60 miles of range when it\u2019s used as a commuter, 40 miles of range when the pace picks up on a twisty road, and it can go flat-out for up to 20 minutes on a track. It retails for $15,495. Brutus 2 Café. The Café option turns the Brutus 2 into a head-turning café racer. The list of modifications includes down-turned handle bars, adjustable rear seats, and a stripped-down chassis that gives the bike the naked look that has historically characterized café racers. It\u2019s equipped with a 10-kWh battery pack, but Brutus hasn\u2019t published additional specifications such as range and output. Pricing is available upon request. Brutus V9. While Harley-Davidson is busily working on building an electric motorcycle, the model is still a couple of years away from cruising down the boulevard. If that\u2019s the style you\u2019re after, Brutus has you covered with the 125-hp V9. The company advertises performance and acceleration that will make any sports car green with envy, though more specific details (such as pricing) haven\u2019t been released yet. That's a tall order -- the fastest cars in the world are truly impressive. Energica Ego45. The 136-hp Energica Ego45 is for riders who want a touch of luxury with their performance. Think of it as a two-wheeled Lamborghini, except it's electric. It stands out with top-of-the-line components (including some that are 3D-printed), as well as design elements borrowed from the worlds of aerospace and racing. Act fast if you want one -- production is strictly limited to just 45 examples. Buyers can work directly with Energica to create a custom, one-of-a-kind bike, and they can even pick it up directly from the factory in Italy. Energica Eva. Energica brought together big names in racing to develop its lineup of performance-oriented electric bikes. Manufactured in Italy, the land of Ducati, the Eva is the most basic model in the Energica catalog. Underneath the muscular design hides a 95-hp motor with up to 120 miles of range when Eco mode is turned on. An 85-percent charge is available in just half an hour when the bike is plugged into a quick charger, so range anxiety becomes less of a worry. Lightning LS-218. Lightning doesn\u2019t beat around the bush -- you know its bikes are electric as soon as you read its name. Instead of catering to commuters or casual riders, the company aimed the LS-218 directly at the top of the electric bike segment. It became the fastest battery-powered motorcycle when it reached 215 mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 2011. Its specifications sheet is equally impressive. It gets a 200-hp, 168-lb-ft. powertrain with up to 180 miles of range. Brembo brakes keep the power in check. This is a full-blown superbike designed to race, as reflected by its asking price of nearly $40,000. Sora by Lito. The Sora by Lito hails from the land of poutine -- Quebec. Built entirely by hand, it turns heads with a design that\u2019s as original as it is sharp. The bodywork is crafted out of carbon fiber to help offset the weight added by the bulky lithium-ion battery pack, and the bike is capable of hitting 60 mph from a stop in four seconds flat. The downside is its Porsche-like $104,000 price tag; that puts it in the same ballpark as a lot of highly desirable two- and four-wheeled machines. Zero S. In many ways, Zero is the Tesla of the electric motorcycle industry. The California-based company has the technology figured out better than most of its rivals, so it offers a comprehensive range of products for all experience levels. Named S, its entry-level model is an urban bike that\u2019s nimble and practical. In its top configuration, the Zero S offers 60 hp, 81 lb-ft, and up to 153 miles of range when it\u2019s ridden in a mix of city and highway conditions. Pricing varies between $10,995 and $16,690. Zero DSR. The DSR is Zero\u2019s dual-sport model. Based on the DS, the R designation signifies it receives an electric motor dialed up to 116 lb-ft, a custom-tuned suspension, and a Bosch ABS system for extra peace of mind. It boasts up to 138 miles of range in a combined cycle, which is plenty for on- and off-road adventures. The Zero DSR starts at $18,690.

V35yr old Rishi Kurne fromKalamboli, Navi Mumbai had lost the thumb of his right hand, while working on a machine. . In April 2017 a 35yr old Rishi Kurne fromKalamboli, Navi Mumbai had lost the thumb of his right hand, while working on a machine at the factory where he is employed. His thumb got trapped and amputated. He consulted Dr Vinod Vij, Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeonat Hiranandani Hospital Vashi-A Fortis Network Hospital. During the consultation, the doctor explained to him that his amputated thumb was crushed beyond repair and it was not re-plantable. A re-plantation surgery is only possible if the amputated part is not crushed, and in such cases the doctor finds the vessel and joins them under the microscope. As first line of treatment, Dr Vij he used his skin from the patient\u2019s abdomen for grafting the thumb, to provide immediate relief,but it continued to hamper his routine work as he could not operate machines or handle equipment.He continued to eat food with his left hand and took longer time to do tasks that he could have easily done otherwise. Understanding his challenges, Dr Vij suggested that the patient\u2019s toe, which is of the same anatomy, could be used to replace his thumb. After explaining the process to the patient and garnering consent, the doctor went ahead with the replacement surgery in June 2017. This was a very rare procedure where the toe was used to replace the thumb through a micro-surgical process that could pose complications. Dr Vij\u2019stechnical expertise in conducting this procedure, enriched the patient with a fully functional hand. It took about six hours to conduct the surgery. Read here Lifesaving heart transplants conducted on two mumbaikars within 4 hours by surgeons at Fortis Hospital, Mulund. It was a very difficult phase for the patient as he struggled with his everyday chores and work was hampered, using his left hand did not help much. Since this is a surgery where the patient loses their toe, it is difficult to convince the patient and their family members to consent for the procedure. However, the Kurne family stood with Rishi\u2019s decision of going ahead with this surgery. Speaking about the procedure DrVinod Vij, Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeon, Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi-A Fortis Network Hospital,said, \u201cThis is a very rare procedure in which we effectively secured all veins and arteries of the patients hand and the surgery was a success. After one month of the surgery, the patient was able to eat with his right hand and is also was able to hold things. He was discharged within five days of the procedure and he has now resumed work where he is efficiently handling the machinery\u201d. . Supporting a family of five, the sole breadwinner of the family now continues to go about his daily chores without hindrance.

V140,000 people have been evacuated as one of Bali\u2019s volcanoes shows signs of a pending eruption. Mount Agung, a volcano located on the popular tourist destination island of Bali, rumbles, threatening to erupt for the first time in 54 years. Mount Agung\u2019s last eruption, in March 1963, killed more than 1,500 people but this time the Indonesian government is more prepared and has set an exclusion zone of 12 kilometers around the volcano. In August, Mount Agung\u2019s volcanic activity increased, prompting the Indonesian government to evacuate more than 140,000 people living in villages located on the slopes of the volcano. They were relocated in 484 temporary shelters spread throughout nine districts and cities in Bali. The size of the temporary shelters varies greatly, from a few dozen people to thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in cooperation with the Indonesian army, local NGOs and volunteers, handle the needs of the relocated people, from food, sanitation and healthcare to entertainment for children. Kopernik, a local NGO from Bali has seen a great response to their online relief effort fundraising campaign, managing to raise more than $45,000. The money has been used to deliver thousands of emergency items including hygiene kits, food, blankets, sleeping mats and other critical supplies to the relocated families. \u201cA great number of people in the community have been extremely generous and responsive to supporting the relief effort. Everything we have been able to deliver to the evacuees would not have been possible without the support of the community,\u201d said Ewa Wojkowska, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Kopernik. For the evacuees life revolves around spending time in the safety of the camps and tending to the animals and homes left behind in the exclusion area. People have abandoned their belongings and their livestock, which for most of them represent their livelihood. During the day, the men take trips back to their villages to check on their family homes and feed the animals. There are efforts being made to relocate livestock to a safe distance from the volcano. The Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with local NGOs have relocated more than 20,000 cattle to spaces in the villages that are offering temporary shelters. Les village, located in Buleleng regency in the north of the island, hosts 2,000 people in its temporary shelter. \u201cWith the help of the National Board for Disaster Management and volunteers from NGOs and nearby villages we managed to provide shelter, food and sanitation. We are planning to raise the capacity of the shelter so we can host 5,000 people,\u201d said Gede Susila, head of Les village. Students from local high schools are volunteering daily to clean up the shelter and organize activities for the children. The relocated children continue their studies, most of them having been enlisted in schools in the temporary camp areas. At Gor Swecapura, the biggest temporary shelter, located in a sports complex in the Klungkung regency, time passes in an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty. During the day, the men are out trying to relocate their family belongings or working, while their worried wives take care of the children and discuss the anticipated eruption. Meanwhile, Mount Agung continues to churn, the increasing volcanic activity monitored by the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center. An eruption could occur at any time.

VThe counsels representing rape convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim on Monday told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that he has \u201crenounced the world\u201d and is not in a position to pay the 30 lakh fine imposed by the trial court. The money is to be paid to the rape survivors. A division bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice Sudhir Mittal admitted the Dera Sacha Sauda Chief\u2019s appeal against his conviction in the rape cases and issued notice to the CBI. The appeal filed by the rape survivors was also admitted by the High Court bench. Gurmeet\u2019s counsel S K Garg Narvana told the division bench that all the Dera properties have been \u201cattached\u201d and he is not in a position to pay the 30 lakh fine imposed by the Special CBI Court. However, the division bench while disposing off the appeal directed Gurmeet to deposit the amount within two months in the CBI Court Panchkula which will keep the same in a nationalised bank till the pendency of appeal.

VThis was a good one! . We\u2019ve seen some fun \u2014 and funny \u2014 celebrations this week. Torrey Smith pretended to hit a home run after he scored for the Eagles, and David Njoku spiked the football into his own butt after he scored for the Browns. Seriously. . But Charcandrick West may have given us the best celebration of the day. It\u2019s the sassiest touchdown dance of the season. . After a four-yard touchdown catch, West did a little dance. . It was West\u2019s second touchdown of the day, and it gave the Chiefs a 23-7 lead going into the half. .

VExactly how beauty enthusiasts follow a healthy CTM routine every day, similarly they have a monthly beauty plan as well. The to-dos of the monthly beauty plan are executed once in a month on the body and not more than that. The frequency of these monthly beauty care plans does not alter, except in case of special occasions. Men and women who abide by these monthly beauty care plans (other than their daily beauty program) live an improved and healthier life. Those who do not repeat these monthly beauty to-dos face gross bodily problems over time. So, here's the list of the most essential beauty care to-dos that you must try to cover every month, in order to maintain a good skin, hair and an overall you. Face Cleanup Or Facial. No matter how much you cleanse, moisturize or tone your skin, an extra layer of dirt still remains on the skin. Usual CTM cannot remove it. Over a span of a month, this clogged layer of dirt and dust increases on your skin and the worst hit part is the face. As the face is the most exposed, it gets maximum clogged and dusted. This is where comes the role of a face cleanup or facial that deep penetrates into your skin cells to clear off the stored dust and dirt particles. These open your skin pores, nourish them, also giving your skin a fresh look. Hair Spa. Now the way your face needs extra pampering once in a month, same is the case with your hair. Irrespective of the length, height or the texture of your hair, your scalp does get clogged with dust and dirt. Thus, a hair spa session, once in a month, clears off the hair scalp completely, encouraging new hair growth. Hair spa alters the texture and appearance of the hair. Pedicure And Manicure. In your monthly beauty care plan, a must-include addition is manicure and pedicure. These two pamper the most ignored parts of your body - palms and feet, respectively. You can do pedicure and manicure at home, only if you have all the right ingredients and you know how to do it. If you're unsure, please book a salon appointment, to do the monthly pedicure and manicure. Body Massage. A body massage is a must in your beauty plan every month. This adds a relieving quotient to your body and rejuvenates you for the month. For body massage, do appoint professionals and try opting for high-end natural or ayurvedic oils. Often, body massage follows with a sauna experience, which you should not miss out on. Threading And Other Hair Removal. In your monthly beauty care plan, threading and hair removal should be there. However, if your hair growth is less and you think you can manage without doing hair removal - then that's your call. For threading and hair removal on your body, only count on experts. Go For Beauty Shopping. Well, beauty experts suggest going for beauty shopping every month, atleast once, so that you can clear out all expired or non-beneficial cosmetics from your dressing table with the useful ones. Also, heading for beauty shopping every month will let you remain updated about the new cosmetics, offers and launches. Those who do not revamp their dressing table regularly, face greater beauty problems.

VPorsche is asking Audi to cover damages over the diesel scandal, according to a recent report. Reuters, citing German newspaper Bild, reports that Porsche is seeking 200-million euros ($234-million) in damages from Audi to cover the costs related to manipulated diesel engines. This sounds a bit strange considering both Porsche and Audi are part of the Volkswagen Group, but Audi has admitted to fitting an illegal auxiliary device to its 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine that is used on various Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche models. The Porsche Cayenne is one of those models equipped with Audi\u2019s V6 diesel, and Porsche was forced to recall the SUV for repairs. Porsche is asking Audi for compensation to cover the costs of the retrofits, legal counseling, and customers measures, says Bild. So next time you\u2019re sitting around the family table at Thanksgiving and something really awkward comes up for conversation, imagine having to ask your sibling for $234-million.

VOct 9 (Reuters) - Insured losses in the United States from Hurricane Nate will be close to $500 million, catastrophe modelling company Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Monday. . The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday that the former hurricane has become a post-tropical cyclone that continues to pack heavy rain and gusty winds. . Hurricane Nate caused flooding in Mississippi, but spared the state from catastrophic damages. On Monday, it was expected to continue tracking northeastward, moving through the Ohio Valley and into the lower great lakes. . KCC said the estimates included insured wind and storm surge losses to residential, commercial, and industrial properties and autos. . Insurers and reinsurers are already counting the costs of Harvey, which lashed Texas causing flooding that put it on the scale of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, which ravaged several islands in the northern Caribbean, before moving into Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. . More recently Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, knocked out the territory\u2019s entire power grid, unleashing severe flooding and causing widespread heavy damage.

VThiruvananthapuram, Oct 9 : Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday hit back at BJP President Amit Shah, accusing him of \u201cspreading canards\u201d about the CPI-M and political violence in the state. Writing on his Facebook page, Vijayan pointed out that there was no space in Kerala for the kind of politics Shah preached \u2014 built on caste, creed, hatred and money power. \u201cAfter realizing that this agenda of his is not going to sell in Kerala, he started spreading canards and baseless lies. His feeling of dejection is understandable and that\u2019s the reason he is speaking like this,\u201d the CPI-M leader said. Shah had on October 3 launched a blistering attack on Vijayan, holding him responsible for the killings of RSS and BJP activists in Kerala. \u201cI pity the failed efforts of Shah, who is the President of a party that rules the country and who tried his best to impose the RSS agenda on Kerala and has failed,\u201d Vijayan said. . He said it was \u201cmost unfortunate\u201d that he led a march to the office of another national party (CPI-M). He called this nothing but a blatant violation of democratic principles. On Monday, the Communist Party of India-Marxist protested against the Bharatiya Janata Party all across the country.

VThe majority of consumers prefer to shop or do research on a brand's site for products they consider buying. CREDIT: Getty Images. For generations, retail was simple. Brands sold to retailers and retailer sold to shops. But in the age of the internet, consumers can interact directly with brand manufacturers. And while this may seem like a small thing, it actually has a dramatic change on the way people interact with business owners. A recent study highlights the need for a good brand website as the majority of consumers expect a better experience from a brand sand from a retailer. Astound Commerce surveyed 1,000 consumers who shop online and have visited a brand. manufacturer's website in the past six months. The survey found the majority of these shoppers (54 percent) turn to brands over retailers for more comprehensive product information, in addition to enhanced customer service, better prices and more personalization options. . In fact, more than half (55 percent) of shoppers prefer to shop directly with brand manufacturers over retailers, according to Astound Commerce Insight's "Global Brand Shopper Survey". The researchers also found that 59 percent of respondents already use a brand manufacturer's website for researching products and usually make their purchase there as well. About 37 percent of respondents said they expect a more engaging experience on a brand manufacturer's website than a retailer's. Pricing was also a concern, with half of respondents expecting better prices on a brand manufacturer's website compared to a retailer's website. . "The role that brand manufacturers play in today's retail landscape has evolved," said Lauren Freedman, SVP of Digital Strategy for Astound Commerce, in a press release. "Consumers' heightened expectations for digital commerce means brands must master online selling and present compelling and competitive shopping experiences, on par with multi-brand counterparts. Moving forward, brands and retailers must explore even more creative ways to demonstrate value and engage through experiential means to woo younger customers and maintain customer loyalty, particularly in light of the challenging retail climate.". This shift toward more brand site usage has implications for business owners. Business owners can't rely on retailers alone to sell the product. In an age where consumers do a lot of research on the items they want to buy, it's necessary for a brand's website to be as effective as a salesperson at a store. This means that business owners can't skimp when it comes to developing their brand's website. It's not enough to provide basic information. People who are coming to the brand site will have detailed questions and they will have higher expectations for the information given. Afterall, if the brand's website can't answer the question they have, who can?. There are a few ways for a brand to make their website more useful to Consumers. For example, a frequently asked questions section is always useful. Live chat is a popular way to provide customer service to Consumers at the brand site. And make sure that commonly searched information such as price size reviews Etc are all easy to find on the website. Producing a higher quality brand site can benefit the business in multiple ways. First, it can increase direct sales from the brand's website. It can also increase sales at retailers because many people will go to a brand website when they want more information about a product they see at a store. So in a way, a good brand site can become its own advertisement. For more information that can help business owners create but a marketing plans, read this article on conducting better email marketing campaigns. .

V CHENNAI: Four people were arrested for staging a robbery to pocket Rs 9 lakh they had collected through a chit fund in Madhavaram Milk Colony on Saturday. Police identified the arrested suspects as P Amudha, 45, her mother Nagammal, 65, their relative Udaya Rajan, 31, and his friend Gandhi Rajan, 39, a resident of Red Hills. .  Police said Amudha, of 3rd Street, in MMDA Layout, Mathur, started a Diwali chit fund in the locality . From the beginning of this year, she collected Rs 1,000 each from at least 150 people in the neighbourhood every month. .  With just a week before the festival, Amudha had to return the sum to the investors, with gifts as a bonus. .  After a few investors started to approach Amudha for their money on Wednes day , she reported the matter to Udaya Rajan, who hatched the plan to stage a robbery. .  On Saturday , Amudha approached the Madhavaram Milk Colony police, claiming that a gang had gagged and robbed Nagammal at knifepoint. .  The robbers, Amudha said, came in when Nagammal was alone and tied her up before robbing her. They later took away `9lakh kept in the cupboard. .  Police interrogated Nagammal and Amudha sepa rately when they received contradictory answers. .  Police also collected security camera footage in which they found two men entering their house at the time specified by Amudha. The footage showed Gandhi Rajan, 29, a friend of Udhayakumar, entering the house and leaving after a while. .  During interrogation, they confessed to the crime. .  Based on this, a case has been registered with the police. The arrested have been remanded in judicial custody. .

VJust like the other organs of our body, our brain can also suffer from various factors and due to some of the unknown reasons. Sometimes, these may turn out to be not so obvious at all. There are some significant habits that can cause a lot of trouble and damage to your brain over a period of time. Sometimes, it turns out to be that you're tired, you can't concentrate and you tend to forget things. The problem is that you're forgetting to take care of an essential part of your body, which is your brain. Your activities can influence your body in certain ways. Sometimes, certain activities can prevent the normal brain functioning and can even damage its structure. If you repeat these actions daily for years and years, then you'll end up killing yourself, as they can damage your brain big time. In this article, we have listed some of the top things that can be harming the brain. Read further to know more about the brain damaging habits that you need to stop right now. 1. Lack Of Communication:. Research has shown that even 10 minutes of communication per day increases the mental ability. Talking helps stimulate the brain and staying mum every day would deteriorate the brain activity in the long run. 2. Too Much Sugar:. A large amount of sugar can adversely affect the neurotrophic factor of the brain, which is responsible for the production of neurons. This is one of the top things that can be harming the brain. 3. Lack Of Brain Exercise:. The peak of brain productivity is reached at 16-25 years, after which it slowly starts to decline. Regular brain exercise can improve its performance, even in people with senile dementia. 4. Skipping Breakfast:. Studies have shown that people who ate breakfast regularly performed better at school. Skipping breakfast can cause a decrease in blood glucose levels that can negatively affect the brain functioning. This is one of the brain damaging habits that you need to avoid. 5. Having Junk Foods In Excess:. Too much of fast foods in your diet can affect the connections between the brain cells. This can affect the formation of short-term and long-term memory. 6. Covering Your Head During Sleep:. When we sleep with our head covered in a blanket, we reduce the amount of oxygen that is entering our body. In this case, we breathe the air that is saturated with carbon dioxide. This is one of the top habits that can damage your brain.

VTimaru's Leah McDonald has a great shot at qualifying for the Youth Olympics in Argentina. The inclusion of speed skating in the Youth Olympics will boost the sport in New Zealand according to long time coach Bill Begg. Begg is excited that there is chance New Zealand's best boy and girl could get a shot at the guaranteed Oceania spot in Argentina next year. "It is possible Oceania's two places could go to South Canterbury skaters, which would be great.". New Zealand coach Bill Begg is delighted that speed skating has been included in the Youth Olympics. The Youth Olympics are held every four years, with the next one in Buenos Aires in October 2018, and Oceania has been given one of the 12 skating spots available. First six placegetters at world championships will qualify, followed by a representative of each of the five Olympic continents, plus one wild card. Begg said no country can however have more than one skater. "Oceania's spot (one each for a boy and girl) will be decided at the speed skating world championships in the Netherlands in July.". Timaru's Leah McDonald, Ariana Snook and Ella Benson are all in with a chance, alonng with Keaton Swindells and Jan Kuepper in the boys. "Leah and Ariana will be at the maximum age of 18 in Argentina, while Ella will be 15 but as the Youth Olympics are only held every four years it will be her only shot.". Begg said there were a couple of decent Australian skaters in the girls but they were light of boys. "It will be decided by an overall points system over three events, the 500m, 1000m and 5000m elimination, all on the track. "No-one can afford a slip-up as it is the individual skater who qualifies, not the country. An injury and it goes to the next person on list.". The New Zealand coach was however pleased the places would be decided on the track rather than in a boardroom. "It takes the politics out of it, you have perform at the world champs." . Begg is hoping inclusion in the Youth Olympics is the first step of speed skating being a demonstration sport at the full Olympics in Paris in 2024. . The world body was working hard to accommodate all the changes the International Olympic Committee wanted, he said. "That included changing from several federations to one body called World Skate as well as the distances that will be raced.". Begg said the 300m sprint and 15,000m elimination were gone. "They were considered too time consuming or boring. I have already changed our training programmes to accommodate that, it is no good training for events that won't be at the Youth Olympics.". In more goods news for the potential competitors the IOC's consolidated fund had provided money for two full training camps to be held beforehand, Begg said. "They will both be held in Timaru and I expect maybe up to a dozen skaters eligible skaters might be interested.".

V The Nobel economics prize has been awarded to Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his contributions to behavioral economics.  The 9-million-kronor ($1.1-million) prize was awarded to the academic for his "understanding the psychology of economics," Swedish Academy of Sciences secretary Goeran Hansson said Monday.  The Nobel committee said Thaler's work shows how human traits affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes.  Thaler, 72, "is a pioneer in behavioral economics, a research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision making," a background paper from the academy said. That "incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions," it said.  The economics prize is something of an outlier \u2014 Alfred Nobel's will didn't call for its establishment and it honors a science that many doubt is a science at all.  The Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was first awarded in 1969, nearly seven decades after the series of prestigious prizes that Nobel called for. Despite its provenance and carefully laborious name, it is broadly considered an equal to the other Nobel and the winner attends the famed presentation banquet.

"With this record, we hope to bring attention to how much joy rescued animals can bring to their new family," says Carla. "Mo is resilient, comical, loving and eternally grateful and loyal to us - her forever family. This once abused and neglected pup has taught us that it's okay to be different. We are proud of her unique feature.".  Watch Mochi's adorable video below:.  On Mochi's achievement, Carla says, "It still does not seem real!

VIf someone were to ask me to describe Madrid in one word, I'd have no hesitation. Simply put, this city is alive. Yes, it boasts exuberant charm and delight just like any other European destination, but what sets Madrid apart is how it thoughtfully threads together passion and culture in the fabric of daily life. Community makes up the warm soul of this city, and no matter how long you stay, it won't take long before you feel a part of it. . So if you're looking to experience Madrid and marvel at the contagious energy it radiates, I say go for it. Book that flight and pack your bags. Don't worry about your itinerary, as that's all covered ahead. Tackling everything from accommodations to eateries and must-see attractions, your ultimate travel guide awaits!.  First Things First: Tackling Where to Stay! . When booking your home away from home, I highly recommend this charming loft via Airbnb. For starters, this quaint apartment couldn't have a more phenomenal location. It's close to so many attractions, yet because it's tucked away off a quiet street, it still radiates those desirable off-the-beaten-path vibes. Plus, at $61 per night, you can sleep soundly knowing this place isn't eating right through your travel budget. Image Source: Airbnb.  Next Up: Tackling Where to Eat! . Another reason to stay at that specific Airbnb? It's right around the corner from the cozy coffee shop known as Martina Cocina. I kid you not, my husband and I ended up eating at this eatery about four times during our visit. This place was just that good. With scrumptious lunch, dinner, and dessert options \u2014 don't even get me started on the coffee \u2014 we simply couldn't get enough. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. After about one or two meals, I quickly realized Madrid is not only home to an abundance of delicious food. No, this corner of Spain takes the festivities of eating to a whole new level. See, when it comes to the culinary scene here, it's all about serving up an unforgettable experience. Take, for instance, Boho Bar, which is pictured above. Forget about mediocre seating when you come to this restaurant. Here, you can mingle and wait for your food as you lounge in swings. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. And if you thought that was cool, just wait. The interior decor is even more eclectic at Ojala. While this might appear to be an average restaurant when your first walk in, head straight downstairs. That assumption will quickly melt away once you feast your eyes on the neon lights and sandpit lounge. Did I mention this place has amazing smoothies? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Yes, it won't take long before you realize this city is practically a gold mine of mouthwatering food. My advice? Just eat and indulge in it all. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. If your taste buds are craving something sweet, head straight to La Bicicleta Cafe, where you will find an excellent assortment of homemade cakes and pastries. Plus, this cozy cafe has an incredibly laid-back atmosphere, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind for a bit. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. If you're as much of a carb fanatic as I am, let me just say a delicious carb-fest will be waiting upon your arrival. No matter which neighborhood you wander, you will most likely find mountains of carbs resting patiently behind glass windows on every corner. I know, I know \u2014 true bliss! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. And if salty chips are more of your cup of tea, well, you're in luck, because there's no shortage of them here! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. If your stomach starts screaming for salads after all the carbs and salty foods, don't worry; I've got your upcoming health kick covered. For starters, El Huerto de Lucas serves awesome organic dishes full of delicious spices and flavors. Another great option is Rayen Vegano, which offers a spectacular vegan menu. Last but certainly not least is El Jardin Secreto de Salvador Bachiller. This tea garden is located on the fourth-floor terrace of a department store and is pretty much a hidden gem. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. How could I forget to mention the Mercado de San Miguel? While this covered food hall can be quite touristy, I highly recommend checking it out. Originally built in 1916, the San Miguel Market is the most popular market in all of Madrid. And with over 30 different vendors selling a dizzying array of freshly prepared food, there's something for everyone. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. From tapas, meats, cheese, and olives to international beer, wine, and Champagne, this is one place you need to come with a big appetite. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. With foods and flavors from all around the globe, there is no doubt a visit to the San Miguel Market will awaken all of your senses. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. And the best part? Because the foods are served in smaller-size portions, you can sample just about everything! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Even the servings of ice cream are teeny-tiny. I mean, have you ever seen a cone that small? No guilt here with that bite. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. I don't think I've ever sampled so much goodness in one place as I did here at this bustling market. As you can imagine, the best decision of the night was opting to wear elastic-waist yoga pants. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb.  Tackling What to Do, See, and Explore . As with the dynamic culinary scene, you won't have to be on Madrid soil for long before you realize there is so much to see, do, and explore in this city. No matter which neighborhood you decide to discover first, you'll be guaranteed an exhilarating experience. One area in particular not to miss is the Paseo del Prado. This district is home to beautiful sights such as the San Jeronimo el Real, a breathtaking 16th-century Roman Catholic cathedral situated atop a hill, as well as the Prado Museum, which is the main Spanish national art museum. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. One of my favorite activities while exploring Madrid was freely roaming and wandering my way around. It was during this time I stumbled upon some of the simplest \u2014 yet most beautiful \u2014 moments. Whether it was strolling past a random floral vendor arranging a stunning bouquet or looking down at the uneven cobblestone streets and thinking about all the many steps that took place before my years, there was tremendous beauty to embrace all over. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Although I am by nature a fast walker \u2014 who knows, maybe it's from those years of living in New York City \u2014 I forced myself to slow my pace down and simply observe throughout my time in Madrid. While beauty was overflowing the streets, I also had to remind myself to look up, as each building seemed to be an architectural masterpiece. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. My wandering eventually led me to the world-renowned Plaza Mayor. Although this is another attraction that can be a bit touristy, I recommend swinging by. This iconic plaza left me speechless. I did go earlier in the morning to avoid the clusters of crowds, but I've read this spot is even more sublime at night. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. See what I mean about every street exploding with charm? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Just as any other city, there were times where the main streets did tend to transform into quite the game of elbow pushing. But what makes Madrid unique is that once you veer off from the crowds and walk down a narrow alleyway, you are then greeted with peaceful plazas that infuse a special sensation of serenity back into your veins. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. While I can't pinpoint the exact reason, something about this city continuously brought forth an ear-to-ear grin on my face. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. But the more I think about it, the more I realize I fell in love with this city because of the people. With each new resident I met and struck up conversation with, I felt more and more embraced and welcomed. Everyone was extremely approachable and inviting, which spoke highly of the city's warm, vibrant culture. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Another thing I appreciated about Madrid was the communal vibes. People were out and about, soaking in the sunshine while enjoying the company of others. As silly as it might sound, I recognized this as a reminder to put away my phone and simply relish the present moment at hand. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Then there was the laid-back atmosphere. It was quite infectious, which I didn't mind one bit. In fact, I tried to bottle up this feeling for when I returned home. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Oh, and don't be surprised if you turn the corner and suddenly come across live music. No matter the time or place, this seemed to happen each day my husband and I were exploring, and I loved each and every encounter. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Now, if you love flea markets, thrift stores, and antique shops, make sure to leave some space in your luggage, because they are everywhere in Madrid. Seriously, everywhere! And each one is teeming with unique treasure. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. If you happen to be in the city on Sunday, be sure to check out El Rastro de Madrid aka the largest flea market in all of Spain. I'll admit, I've experienced my fair share of flea markets, but I had never encountered anything like this. Hundreds of vendors lined the streets, selling anything and everything you can imagine. It was awesome! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. You really will have no idea what you might stumble upon next. But trust me, it's an unforgettable experience to take part in and will leave you with tons of decor inspiration! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. And the best part? (OK, one of the best parts.) You can find beautiful local artwork at amazing prices. So if you're looking for a place to find souvenirs, this is it! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Yet if your trip doesn't happen to fall on a Sunday, no worries! Madrid has tons of other eclectic shops to browse your way through. From books and collectibles to vintage clothing and retro finds, this city truly has it all. One bookstore in particular to check out is Panta Rhei. This shop has an amazing selection of graphic design and illustration books and carries options from both large and small independent publishers. Plus, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. If you want to see the city from a bird's eye view, hop aboard the Teleferico de Madrid. This cable car was originally built as part of the Parque de Atracciones amusement park, but now takes you over the River Manzanares and into the Casa de Campo park. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Once you arrive to the other side, you'll be greeted with sweeping panoramic views of the city, and you will now be in the largest park of Madrid. With over 4,000 acres to explore, this is a great place to marvel in the fresh air and reconnect with nature. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Another must-see attraction is the Arganzuela Footbridge. Uniting the two banks of the Manzanares River, this spiraling and conical bridge is dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists. Originally built to improve the urban connections between the north and south neighborhoods of Madrid, this footbridge has quickly become an iconic landmark within the city. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Looking to feast your eyes on a beautiful, historic palace? If so, head over to the Sabatini Gardens. Located on the north side of the Royal Palace, these neoclassical-style gardens not only offer magnificent views, but exploring this area is also free! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Plus, there are quite a few peacocks on the premises that are eager to show off! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Yearning for even more serenity? Head over to El Retiro Park. Also known as the "the green lungs of the city," this oasis is home to over 15,000 trees and over 300 acres. As you can imagine, there is an abundance of space to sit back, relax, and rest a while. Or, in my case, eat an entire crate of strawberries . . . Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. In the heart of the park lies the Retiro Park Lake, which is a popular spot for both locals and travelers alike. It is here you can indulge in a little sunbathing and even rent a rowboat if you're looking to get out on the calming water. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Another can't-miss attraction in the park is the Palacio de Cristal. This palace was originally built in 1887 and is made almost entirely of glass and metal. In other words, it is absolutely breathtaking. Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. Did I mention it's free to explore? Image Source: Kathryn McLamb. So at the end of the day, no matter where your curiosity leads you to in Madrid, I know one thing for certain: you'll have an incredible adventure. And if your journey is anything like mine, you'll leave as a different person than you were when you arrived. Happy travels! Image Source: Kathryn McLamb.

VIt's virtually impossible. A perennial topic of science fiction, researchers stumbled upon the answer to the question of whether or not we're secretly living inside of a computer. From Star Trek: The Next Generation\u2019s "Ship in a Bottle" episode, to the eponymously named computer system in the movie The Matrix, the idea that life is little more than a computer simulation has served as a sci-fi standby for generations. But that technological twist on the idea that life might just be a dream can\u2019t possibly be true. Right?. Well, what if it is? What if this life is just a simulation of the real thing? What if you, in an incredibly meta act, are reading this on a computer while residing inside of a computer? Once inserted, the thought niggles away at us\u2014we can\u2019t think our way out of this quagmire. \u201cWhat if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?\u201d asks Morpheus in The Matrix. Dude. But now researchers say they've sussed out the whole situation for us. Theoretical physicists Zohar Ringel and Dmitry Korvizhini, who are based at Racah Institute of Physics Hebrew University in Israel and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, claim to prove the concreteness of our reality in a recent Scientific Advances study. To understand what they found, it helps to first recognize what a computer is: it's essentially a machine that performs calculations. In order for a computer to simulate reality, then, the machine would need to have enough power to actually create the phenomena that we experience within its simulated environment. What the researchers discovered, however, is that storing the information required to simulate certain behaviors of even a couple hundred electrons would take more atoms than exist in the universe. For better or for worse, this world is real. Probably. The researchers didn\u2019t set out to disprove the central plot of your favorite Doctor Who episode. That was an accident. Kovrizhi and Ringel were trying to see if they could use a mathematical method to model systems that display anomalies (the stuff that always gets Star Trek ships into trouble) like those of the quantum Hall effect. The regular Hall effect (normally just called the Hall effect) explains how, under the right circumstances, metals can display some interesting electrical behaviors. For example, if you take a a metal bar and send a current flowing through it, you expect electrons to keep moving straight ahead in the direction of the current. But when you apply a magnetic field perpendicularly to the current, the Hall effect predicts that the electrons will turn and start moving perpendicularly to both the current\u2019s original direction and the magnetic field. The quantum Hall effect takes the standard Hall even further: when you take conductive material into an environment that\u2019s both very cold (near Absolute Zero, or -459.67 F), and has a strong magnetic field, particles behave even more oddly. Kovrizhi and Ringel were trying to get a better grasp on why. Two plus two is pretty easy to solve (the answer, in case you\u2019re wondering, is four). These sorts of equations are fine for relatively simple systems\u2014we can do them with a calculator, if not in our minds. But these kinds of easy calculations start to break down when dealing with the weird quantum behavior that occurs at the very very small (we\u2019re talking about systems smaller than the goings on of individual atoms) level. There are more unknowns\u2014and you can have an infinite number of particles interacting. That\u2019s what is known as the many body problem. \u201cWhen you do physics and you don\u2019t know how to solve something, you say, maybe I can just have my computer solve it for me and that will give me some intuition,\u201d Ringel told Popular Science. So he and his colleague turned to quantum Monte Carlo, a family of computational methods that use random sampling to study complex quantum systems that can\u2019t be solved directly. But the researchers discovered that for every particle they added to the system, the simulation became exponentially more complex. It essentially doubled in complexity with each new particle (not unlike the reproductive rate of a tribble), making the problem unresolvable. It's not that people hadn't attempted to solve for quantum Hall before. People have tried solving it using laptops, and big clusters of computers. Ringel and Kovirzhi didn't necessarily expect to succeed, but they hoped to figure out why it had never been done. It could be that humans aren't smart enough, or that physicists just haven't yet found the right mathematical mapping. The new study makes it clear that it's just not possible to simulate the effect. And to the study authors, that suggests it would be impossible for a computer to create our world. "If you see a phenomena that can't be simulated by a classical computer, that means we can\u2019t be part of a huge classical computer that is simulated while someone steals our energy, for example," says Ringel. In other words: no Matrix scenario. There are of course, some caveats. In the Matrix, the trick to bending the spoon is to realize there is no spoon. Unfortunately, your spoons are probably real. First, this presumes that the physical laws of the universe in which our not-so-benevolent overlords are operating mirror those found within the simulated fortress we call home. That might seem like a big presumption. But ask any special effects crew; it's really hard to build a world, and even harder to have it make physical sense. The route of least resistance would be to model a fake world after the real thing. The study also assumes that any potential puppet masters are using computers as we know them. "If they somehow know how to run quantum computers, that completely dissolves our claims," says Ringel. Classical computers, like the kind you're probably reading this on, treat electrons as particles. Quantum computers treat electrons as probabilities that are best conceived of as waves\u2014the electron isn't in one place but in many places at the same time. "Quantum computers can solve certain problems that regular computers can't," says Ringel. "You can factor very large numbers and break all of the standard encryption techniques that we have today. But nobody has ever built a quantum computer and shown that it does that." Or nobody inside our reality, anyway. This isn\u2019t the only quantum interaction for which predictive algorithms haven\u2019t yet been found. This paper suggests that they may never be uncovered, putting a kibosh on the idea that reality could be an elaborate game of The Sims. Absent a fundamental reworking of our universe, the world is probably the real world. Unless, of course, it\u2019s just a dream.

VEmployer branding is taking the recruiting industry by storm. Make sure your organization isn't missing the boat by failing to provide the "right" information. . CREDIT: Getty Images. In today's market place, to attract and hire top talent, recruiters must act like marketers. Rather than differentiating a product or service, recruiters have to position their organizations as top employers. This process is known as employer branding. How impactful is it? According to iCims, a software solutions provider to the talent acquisition industry, 94 percent of candidates are likely to apply to a job if a company actively manages its employer brand. On the flip side, LinkedIn found that not knowing what it's like to work for an organization is the number one obstacle that candidates face during the application process. In a nutshell, employer branding connects who your organization is to what it does. One of the best ways to spread the word, per Phil Strazzulla, CEO and founder of NextWave Hire, a startup that specializes in employer branding, is "to create lots of in-depth content that candidates care about.". That makes sense, but where do you start? Luckily, through a 2016 LinkedIn Global Trends report, we have five pieces of direct advice from candidates on what to share about our companies and prospective roles:. 1. Give an honest perspective. Recruiters' knee-jerk reactions are to highlight the awe-inspiring and overwhelmingly positive experiences. In reality, everyone knows that those instances are few and far between. Instead, provide a real-life picture of what it's like to work inside your environment. Doing so will increase the chances that you not only hire the "right" person for the role, but also for your culture. 2. Share employee views. Although primed and proper presentations from the company's executives bode well with shareholders and customers, prospective employees actually want to hear directly from the staff member's perspectives. Yes, this also means the negative aspect of the job as well. Disclosing some of the current frustrations ensures that recruiters don't set false expectations and over-promise and under-deliver. 3. Explain what makes you different. Work is work. From a job description standpoint, "accountants" can be "accountants" anywhere. Rather than marketing the role itself, make sure to highlight examples of why your organization is different from others. Whether it's a collaborative environment, having access to coaching and mentoring, or an onsite gym that sets you apart, prospective employees want a better understanding of what life will be like. 4. Clarify the vision and strategy. It's tough to gain a true understanding of an organization's vision through headlines alone. Having an executive delve deeper into your mission will help recruits better connect what your organizations does with why they do it. 5. Be open about retention. Also known as: Be honest about why this position is open. Whether newly created or open due to voluntary turnover, people appreciate transparency. As a recruiter, this piece of advice terrifies me. Although you can't disclose everything, painting an accurate representation of the position and expectations is critical to the new employee's success -- and candidates know it. Set them up for success by being as up front as possible. A few of these suggestions may feel uncomfortable to discuss. However, their effectiveness is undeniable. Through Strazzulla's research, focusing on employer branding can significantly decrease your cost per hire, increase the likelihood that career site visits turn into applications, and double the amount of job applicants.

VMUMBAI - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank's inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday. Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter. The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week. "Growth is always there in the MPC's scheme of things; we don't lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation," Patel was quoted as saying in the interview. "However, we have to be careful \u2014 we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.". Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India's central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexbility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility. The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a "durable basis", Patel said. Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts. However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts. "Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent," he told Mint. "We have started seeing the upturn.". Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year. (Reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury).

He was speaking at a press meet at Jaladarshini. \u201cEarlier, Devegowda used to say that Siddaramaiah was responsible for the development of Chamundeshwari constituency. Now, he is making allegations as Chief Minister after Siddramaiah announced that he is contesting from Chamundeshwari constituency. Siddaramaiah never believes n political venedetta. Devegowda has insulted the voters by saying he will defeat Siddaramaiah in the elections, Vijay Kumar he added. \u201cSiddaramaiah and I were taluk board members in 1978. I became MLA with the support of the public. I lost 2003 elections to GTD as he spent money in crores for the elections. As president of Karnataka Housing Board, he was involved in lot of corruption practices. He made land agreement with the farmers for Rs 3 lakh and sold it for Rs 26 lakh,\u201d alleged former MLA Satyanarayana.

VWhether it\u2019s floating clocks or hovering smartphone chargers, levitation is hot right now. That's why we\u2019re totally hyped at the prospect of some fascinating research coming out of the Sussex Computer Human interaction (SCHI) Lab at the U.K.\u2019s University of Sussex, where engineers have figured out how to make a levitating food-delivery system, in which tasty grub floats straight into your mouth. No knife and fork required!. \u201cWe are interested in a way to deliver small quantities of food to a user without anyone touching the food,\u201d Sriram Subramanian, professor of Informatics at the University of Sussex, told Digital Trends. \u201cWe created a way to deliver food from a dropper to the user\u2019s mouth without touching anything. Food morsels are levitated using acoustic levitation techniques, and transported using our device to the user\u2019s mouth. This is an semi-automated process giving us digital control over what food is delivered to the user's mouth, when it is delivered, and how much is delivered.\u201d. So far, the TastyFloats technology has been used to levitate tiny droplets of wine, blue cheese, bread, lettuce, meat, bread, and raspberry grain. Interestingly, the droplets of food changed the way that the flavors were registered by users. In volunteer trials, sweet tastes were reported as being more intense and recognizable, while bitter tastes were much harder to recognize. \u201cOur biggest challenge in this work was to be able to control the levitation system so that food morsels are stable in the system, whether it is wine, meat, or cheese that we are levitating,\u201d Subramanian continued. \u201cIn other words, we needed to find a way to control the levitation energy so that it is strong enough to hold different density food items, but not so strong that they evaporate.\u201d. Subramanian suggested that the technology could be used to deliver a more complete multisensory experience to people experiencing virtual reality, television, or gaming. Imagine, for example, being in a virtual environment that not only looks real but tastes real, as well -- without you needing to do any more than open your mouth to achieve the intended effect. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve created [so far] is a first prototype that is somewhat cumbersome to use,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cIn the future, we want to make the delivery system more robust and easy to deploy. We would also look to try and create a short movie experience which incorporates our TastyFloats system to get an idea of how users experience it. Finally, we would love to work with content developers to create content that harnesses the potential of our device. While I can easily see a more refined version of our system becoming a real-world device, this is probably a few years away.\u201d.

V Himachal Pradesh University (HPU) becomes the first University in North India to provide 5% reservation to differently-abled students. The move comes after Umang Foundation filed a PIL in High Court. . 'Divyang' Students To Get 5% Reservation At Himachal Pradesh University. New Delhi: Himachal Pradesh University (HPU) becomes the first University in North India to provide 5% reservation to differently-abled students. The move comes after Umang Foundation filed a PIL in High Court. After instructions from the High Court, not only reservation was given to differently-abled students but they were also provided with adequate hostel and boarding facility. The foundation had filed the PIL after a blind student from Chamba was denied admission in MA Political Science course. .  This year not a single differently abled student was admitted in MA Economics course the University. At a B.Ed. college in Dharmshala, only 7 seats out of 250 were reserved for differently-abled students. Only 2 seats out of 100 seats were reserved for differently abled students in B.Ed. course offered at the University campus. .  The Umang Foundation had written a letter to the High Court about the University's denial of admission to differently abled students. The court treated the letter as a PIL and directed the University to follow the regulations. .  The foundation contested that since Disability Rights Act 2016 was enacted across the country on April 19 this year then why was the University not following it. As per the Act, every government educational institute and government-aided institute should reserve 5% seats for differently abled students. .  Click here for more Education News. Comments.

VThe No. 1 overall pick had a delayed start to his career, but it made Sunday not so bad despite another Browns loss. The Cleveland Browns were still unable to get their first win of the season on Sunday. The Jets handed the Browns a 17-14 loss that forced Hue Jackson to bench DeShone Kizer in favor of Kevin Hogan. At the very least \u2014 Myles Garrett was good. The Browns took Garrett with the No. 1 overall pick this past April, widely assumed to be the safest pick in quite some time. He missed the Browns\u2019 first four games because of a high-ankle sprain, but Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams said Friday that Garrett had a good week, and \u201ca really good look in his eye.\u201d. Sunday, Garrett had eyes for Josh McCown, who he sacked twice. The first one came on his very first snap as a pro. \u201cIt was just a great call by Gregg (Williams) sending me inside,\u201d Garrett said via Cleveland.com. \u201cHe jumps at me and I was just able to put a move on and make the play.\u201d His second sack came just after the two-minute warning. The sacks are great, but Browns fans have to love how Garrett has clearly embraced Cleveland and some of its other favorite athletes, like J.R. Smith. Garrett paid tribute to Smith with a celebration after the second sack, with one of his best celebrations after a shot ever \u2014 even if it did come when he was with the Knicks. Garrett lived up to his words prior to the draft, where he told ESPN the Magazine, \u201cIf you don\u2019t draft me No. 1, I will punish your team for the next 10 to 12 years.\u201d . He became the first top pick to register a sack in his first NFL game in 25 years. That\u2019s not even something the great Bruce Smith did. Myles Garrett is the first #1 overall pick with a sack in his first NFL game since Steve Emtman in 1992 pic.twitter.com/emNn8eLUPN. \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) October 8, 2017 . Another impressive part of Garrett\u2019s afternoon, was that he was limited. \u201cWe had him on a pitch count,\u201d Hue Jackson said via Cleveland.com. \u201cI think that was important. His energy was outstanding.\u201d. Garrett didn\u2019t sound complacent after the game \u2014 he\u2019s ready for more. \u201cI always want more,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want to make more plays, have more effect on the outcome of the game, but as many as they give me I\u2019ll take and I\u2019m just going to try to do my best to make plays out there.\u201d. Outside of Garrett\u2019s performance on Sunday, the Browns have been quite bad this season. Going into Sunday, they were 26th in total offense while having scored just 63 points in four games leading up to Sunday. However, the Browns haven\u2019t been egregiously bad on defense. They\u2019re 16th in the NFL in total defense, and seventh in run defense \u2014 and that\u2019s been without Garrett. If Garrett can help the Browns improve off of those initial stats and help them get some wins, then the Browns might be bearable to watch. So far, the offense has been a mess, to say the least. DeShone Kizer hasn\u2019t been what the Browns needed \u2014 but he also isn\u2019t exactly equipped with the proper weapons. Corey Coleman has been injured since Week 2, leaving him with Ricardo Louis, Kenny Britt, and Rashard Higgins at wide receiver. The leading receiver on the team is Duke Johnson, a running back, with tight end Seth Devalve second in yards. The 0-5 start has been disappointing for the Browns. It appeared they made some good changes during the offseason, and improved the roster with picks like Garrett, Kizer, David Njoku, and Jabrill Peppers. Though it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still work to be done in Cleveland. If Garrett lives up to the type of player everybody expects him to be, he\u2019ll be the franchise player has desperately needed since coming back to the NFL in 1999. At the very least, he gives Browns fans hope for a better future, when there was none before.

VSC Refuses to Review Order Lifting Ban on Firecrackers in Delhi. Ban on firecrackers lifted by Supreme Court in Delhi-NCR (representational image). New Delhi, Oct 9: The Supreme Court on Monday quashed the review petition over lifting the ban on firecrackers for Diwali in Delhi. The three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri and comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and Abhay Manohar Sapre, had reserved its order on Friday. On September 12, the Supreme Court had lifted the ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and the NCR region, but with riders. The top court asked the Delhi Police to issue a licence to shopkeepers for sale of firecrackers, adding that the number of licences issued should not exceed 500. The top court had also made it clear that there would be no firecrackers in the silence zones. The court had directed to constitute a committee, which will be chaired by the Chairperson of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consisting of eight other officers to submit a report on the same by December 31, 2017. The committee was asked to submit a detailed report regarding the health hazards of firecrackers on people during the festive season, especially on Dussehra and Diwali. A total of 100 firecracker companies moved the Supreme Court on January 30 seeking modification of its earlier order, which had put a ban on selling of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. The Firecracker Association, earlier in December last year, moved the apex court, challenging its earlier order of banning firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. On November 25, 2016, the apex court banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR until further notice in wake of the alarming levels of air pollution in the region.

VEveryone has their own go-to uniform, whether it be jeans and a white tee or an all-black outfit. And like us, Bella Hadid too has found an outfit she swears by: denim on denim. Unless you follow her style closely, you can't immediately tell this is her go-to choice, but after we combed through her street style snaps, we found more than enough proof the model loves this Spring trend. Despite its stigma for being hard to pull off, Bella's shown us you can wear the style from coast to coast and season to season. She's worn Canadian tuxedos in Spring (a denim jacket and mini skirt combo) and in Winter (jeans and a denim jacket). . Although this is Bella's safety-net outfit, there is nothing "safe" about the way she works her combos. She can take denim on denim to an edgy level (with chokers and fishnet tights) or tones it down with a bohemian twist and with distressed styles in lighter washes. That's the magic of this uniform: you can wear it multiple ways and it still looks fresh. Scroll on to see how Bella's mastered denim on denim and if you're in need of further outfit inspiration, our ultimate guide on how to wear the trend should do the trick. Bella Hadid wore a cropped denim jacket with her frayed GRLFRND denim skirt and Schutz heels. Image Source: Getty / SMXRF/Star Max. For Gigi's 22nd birthday, Bella turned to her go-to look of denim on denim. This time, she wore embroidered rose patterns on her Adam Selman jacket and jeans. Image Source: Getty / Gotham. Bella proved denim's versatility when she stepped out in this faded-black ensemble. She wore a fishnet body suit under her tee and matched her jacket to her jeans. The outfit had a touch of edginess thanks to her boots, choker, and matrix-style shades. Image Source: FameFlynet. Two words: Canadian tuxedo. Bella gave it a 2017 spin, however, with a black crop top and chokers. Everything about her outfit, from the over-size jacket to the flared pants, screamed casual and cool.

Denim jackets and jeans are an easy combo, but Bella took it up a notch with this denim mini skirt. She kept it sexy underneath with a sheer shirt that showed off her bralette. Image Source: Getty / Marc Piasecki. The model's been wearing denim on denim since last year, proving this outfit is her go to every time. For the warm weather, Bella ditched the darker colors and opted for a light, distressed mini to go with her cropped denim jacket. The squeaky-clean white booties gave her look a Summertime feel. Image Source: Getty / NCP/Star Max. When your denim jacket collection includes all fits and colors, it's easy to pull together a denim-on-denim look. Bella invested in a washed-out black piece to go with her GRLFRND mini. Instead of ankle boots this time, the model wore over-the-knee boots for a sexy and sassy vibe. Image Source: Getty / Marc Piasecki. White lace-up jeans might not be your pick of choice, but when paired with a light blue denim trench you have to admit the outfit is worth a try. Bella's got the right idea on mixing two different colored denims together. Image Source: Getty / Michael Stewart.

V Art & Culture . Culture plays an important role in the development of any nation. It represents a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices. Culture and creativity manifest themselves in almost all economic, social and other activities. A country as diverse as India is symbolized by the plurality of its culture. India has one of the world\u2019s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts, rites and rituals, paintings and writings that are known, as the \u2018Intangible Cultural Heritage\u2019 (ICH) of humanity. In order to preserve these elements, the Ministry of Culture implements a number of schemes and programmes aimed at providing financial support to individuals, groups and cultural organizations engaged in performing, visual and literary arts etc. This section offers comprehensive information related to cultural heritage, ancient monuments, literary arts, visual arts, schemes, programmes, performing arts, fairs and festivals and handicraft of India. Detailed information on various organizations involved in promotion and propagation of Indian art and culture is also available in this section.

VA 2014 study found that India\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme captures only 0.35% of the annual number of clinically diagnosed dengue cases. Credit: hinkelstone/Flickr, CC BY 2.0. Sandhya Sekar is a freelance science writer interested in evolution, ecology and wildlife. \u201cAll it takes is an empty coconut shell, left out in the rain,\u201d says Dr George Varghese, from the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, while discussing the recent dengue epidemics in India. The shell can act as a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which transmit the dengue virus between humans with when they bite. The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the primary carrier of the dengue virus, bites mostly during the day \u2013 which means unless you\u2019re in an air-conditioned cocoon without any ventilation, you are in danger of the pesky insects and the disease they carry. The coconut shell is just an example. Stagnant water along roads, temporary rain puddles, not-so-temporary rubbish-ridden rivers, a garbage dump waterlogged in the rain \u2013 all make excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Dengue is one of the main mosquito-borne diseases in India, along with malaria, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. What sets it apart (or not) is the generality of its symptoms: high fever, headaches and joint pain, indicative of any viral infection. The dengue virus DENV also causes pain behind the eyes, itching and severe joint pain \u2013 a triad of symptoms used to profile dengue clinically, according to Cecilia Dayaraj from the National Institute of Virology in her 2014 review of dengue in India. Only one in four dengue infections manifest symptoms, but asymptomatic cases act as carriers of infection, a silent reservoir that can aid the spread of dengue epidemics. The current notion is that dengue can cause a \u201ccontinuous spectrum of clinical disease\u201d. It may not give rise to symptoms at all or just cause a mild fever. On the other end of the spectrum, it can cause the fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is a \u2018vascular leak syndrome\u2019, where fluid oozes out of blood vessels, leaving behind thick blood that cannot flow. Severe DHF paralyses the circulatory system and leads to death. Another fallout of dengue being so generic in it symptoms is that it is grossly underreported. A 2014 study found that India\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) captures only 0.35% of the annual number of clinically diagnosed dengue cases. Using data from a case study in Madurai and extrapolations suggested by an expert panel, the study found that India could have had an annual average of 5,778,406 clinically diagnosed dengue cases between 2006 and 2012. That\u2019s 282-times the number reported every year (average). \u201cThe government numbers are just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Soumya Swaminathan, the outgoing director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and soon to be deputy chief of the World Health Organisation, in an interview with PTI. Bearing this in mind, it is important to note that the NVBDCP estimated close to 130,000 cases and 250 deaths in 2016. As of August 2017, about 36,000 cases have already been reported in India. A virus-mosquito match that clicked. Dengue is caused by viruses of the genus Flavivirus. The story of dengue evolution started in the forests of Southeast Asia, where the ancient Flavivirus was probably a mosquito- or tick-borne virus, which diverged around 2,000 years ago by adapting to vertebrate hosts like birds, bats and forest-dwelling primates. The virus then adapted to survive in mosquitoes, using them as vectors: agents that can carry the virus and transmit the disease between hosts. The virus first evolved with Aedes albopictus, a day-biting mosquito common near forest areas, and later also began using Ae. aegypti. The fantastically versatile Ae. aegypti soon became the primary vector for dengue. The mosquito is highly adapted to the urban environment. It can breed in small collections of water. Even a small plastic cup would suffice. As the Aedes species spread all over the world with increased movement of humans and goods, dengue went with them. The 18th, 19th and 20th centuries saw many dengue pandemics, and the two World Wars accelerated the spread of the disease. \u201cThe main reason [for dengue\u2019s spread] is a combination of global trends that have all emerged and converged in the past few decades,\u201d wrote Duane Gubler, an internationally renowned dengue expert from the Duke-NUS Medical School, to The Wire in an email. \u201cPopulation growth, unprecedented urban growth that provides the ideal ecology for viruses and mosquitoes, globalisation and modern transportation that provides the ideal mechanism for transporting the viruses and mosquitoes among population centres; and, deterioration of public health infrastructure and lack of effective mosquito control in tropical cities.\u201d. The dengue virus today has four serotypes. A serotype is a group within a species of microorganisms that has its own set of distinctive surface structures. One serotype is usually responsible for one epidemic, but there have been cases where more than one serotype circulates during an epidemic. \u201cWhen a person already infected with one serotype is infected by a second, the body cannot fight both serotypes at the same time,\u201d CMC Vellore\u2019s Varghese told The Wire. The dengue virus has found a way to make its host\u2019s body turn against itself. Antibodies produced against one dengue serotype can enhance infection by a second serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. \u201cThis could be one reason for the increased severity of dengue infection in some cases,\u201d according to Varghese. A recent genetic analysis by the National Institute of Virology found that the prevalent dengue strains in India have been changing temporally. When dengue epidemics started in India in the 1950s and 1960s, all four serotypes were present in a mild form. Today, per the study, all four have been replaced by lineages with greater virulence and transmissibility. Genetic analyses have shown that the DENV-4 serotype, and a particular genotype of DENV-3, originated in India. \u201cIncreased transmission increases the rate of mutation in the virus, increasing the probability of new virus strains emerging that have greater fitness, epidemic potential and virulence\u201d, said Gubler. The Indian dengue epidemics have a very distinct trend. The first epidemics are in the south and then the disease spreads north. Mosquitoes breed better in warm, humid environments and they follow the monsoons northwards. \u201cThe rainy season, with increased humidity, increases the survival of the mosquito, thus increasing the probability that an infected mosquito will live long enough to transmit the virus to other persons,\u201d Gubler added. Combating dengue: getting rid of the mosquito. Fighting the disease by targeting the mosquito has been the favoured method to combat dengue thus far. Killing off adult mosquitoes by aerial spraying has been the go-to solution but its effectiveness has been questionable. Ae. aegypti dwells in sheltered areas where the spray doth not go. The chemicals need repeated application; the mosquitoes can develop resistance; and their environmental effects are numerous (remember DDT?). Studies have found that targeting the larval stage with chemicals like temefos is not a sure-shot method either. Using fish, like guppies, that eat up mosquito larvae has been discussed as an option but it could get expensive in the large scale. Using genetically modified mosquitoes carrying a lethal gene that can induce sterility in wild mosquitoes is under trial. Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia naturally infect many insects, though not mosquitoes that cause dengue. The bacteria can inhibit the growth of other microbes in its hosts and shorten their lifespan. Wolbachia is also compatible with a range of insects: a strain collected from one insect species can be used to infect another, even if the insect hosts are not related. A 2011 study by Scott O\u2019Neill and team from Monash University, Australia, found that the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis can be used to infect Ae. aegypti, where it can prevent the dengue virus from replicating in the mosquito. When introduced into an uninfected species, Wolbachia spreads rapidly. The idea is for Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes \u2013 which cannot carry dengue \u2013 to replace wild mosquitoes, inhibiting the virus\u2019s spread. During a field trial in Australia, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia were able to transform a population of wild mosquitoes. Moreover, after three months, the incidence of dengue in the mosquito population remained low. Based on the success of further field trials, Monash University launched a nonprofit called the World Mosquito Program, until recently called \u2018Eliminate Dengue\u2019. With an international team of funding agencies, the program has expanded to countries in Southeast Asia, South America, the Pacific islands and, most recently, to India. \u201cFrom the first discovery that Wolbachia can block the replication of arboviruses in the mosquito, to the establishment of Wolbachia in five countries with one million people protected by Wolbachia, has been an astonishing journey in a short space of time,\u201d said Cameron Simmons, the director of impact assessment at the World Mosquito Program. \u201cOur approach is not inconsistent with traditional mosquito control programs. In fact, we encourage communities and government to continue these efforts during and after we\u2019ve deployed Wolbachia,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, the reality is that traditional mosquito control programs are underfunded and imperfectly delivered. Indeed decades of evidence tells us that they have failed to stop disease transmission in endemic countries. It\u2019s time to try novel approaches that can deliver long-term, cost-effective reductions in disease incidence.\u201d. Using Wolbachia to combat mosquito-borne diseases has recently received approval from the WHO. Simmons and others at the World Mosquito Program are also confident that further evidence of reduced disease transmission, and improved public health in areas where Wolbachia has been introduced, will bring in more funding and widespread adoption of this technique. What will happen in India, however, remains to be seen. Combating dengue by tackling the virus. When a mosquito carrying dengue bites an unwary human being, the virus pops out of the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands onto human skin. The skin cell folds around the virus, forming a little pouch that draws the virus into the cell. Once safely inside, the virus disintegrates to reveal its incredibly simple genetic material: one strand of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is similar to our DNA. The virus then shows its true colours: it uses the host cell\u2019s machinery to make copies of itself. Different parts of baby viruses are made, assembled and finally released into the blood. The viruses then go on to infect other cells. The human body does not remain idle once it encounters a virus. It mounts an immune response, secreting white blood cells that seek out the virus and attempt to engulf it. But the virus has a devious trick up its sleeve: it infects the very cells sent out to kill it. As the infected white blood cells travel around the body, so does the virus, spreading all over and resulting in viremia \u2013 the presence of viruses in the bloodstream. Infected cells secrete chemicals called interferons, which activate further immune defences. Some types of white blood cells secrete antibodies that recognise and neutralise virus particles. The infected person now suffers from a fever lasting for about a week. Since fever is the first manifestation of the disease, it becomes difficult to differentiate dengue from a simple flu. The National Institute of Virology has a kit that can detect dengue, and other commercial tests are also available. An example is Dengue Day 1, a test that can detect dengue even before the onset of fever. Developed by Navin Khanna\u2019s research group from the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, the test is rapid and sensitive, capable of detecting dengue antibodies in very dilute samples. \u201cThe test can even tell you if you have had dengue in the past,\u201d Khanna told The Wire. \u201cThis kind of information is critical to the doctor. If it\u2019s secondary dengue, it is much more severe, and you can lose the patient in a day.\u201d Secondary dengue means a person who has had dengue before and has been infected again. \u201cEven as recently as five years ago, tests to detect dengue were very expensive\u201d, said Khanna. \u201cNow, the costs have plummeted.\u201d. Since dengue has been around for many hundreds of years, traditional medical practices have evolved their own ways of dealing with the disease. Vaccinating against dengue has been part of the plan to combat the disease \u2013 but vaccine candidates are still not in a position to hit the market. Global pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has developed a vaccine against dengue but India has not approved it for use. \u201cI salute Sanofi for spending 20 years, and 1.2 billion dollars, on a tropical disease that is not their problem,\u201d said Khanna. \u201cThe Sanofi vaccine does not work on patients who have never had dengue before; it is a booster vaccine. There has also been health issues post vaccination, especially in children\u201d. The WHO has said, \u201ca dengue vaccine would represent a major advance in the control of the disease\u201d, and many teams are working on a vaccine that can provide cover against all four dengue serotypes. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated 58.4 million dengue cases in 2013 and about 10,000 deaths worldwide. These numbers translate into an economic burden of almost $9 billion in 2013 alone. Though the number of deaths due to dengue is relatively small, the pressure on healthcare systems and the reduction in workforce strength due to the illness take a heavy toll. The fight against dengue thus needs to be at many levels: measures to control Aedes mosquito populations, vaccinating against the mosquito using techniques like Wolbachia infections, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease and, finally, developing a vaccine that can fight against all four serotypes. .

VAOL Instant Messenger (AIM), many of ours\u2019 first social experience on the Internet will shut down forever this December 15, the company announced on Friday, acknowledging that people now communicate in new ways online, so AIM is no longer needed. \u201cAIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,\u201d Michael Albers, communications products VP at Oath wrote in a post. When AIM launched in 1997, using the World Wide Web required a desktop computer with a clunky dial-up connection that tied up the phone lines. AIM played the most significant role in establishing the Internet as a place to hang out rather than being a simple utility. But, its refusal to evolve with time meant that in the age of smartphones, AIM lost its relevance in front of text messages or other social apps, like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. Other classic chat apps that have shut down in recent years are MSN Messenger (shutting down in 2014) and Yahoo Messenger shutting down last year (although Yahoo also launched a new messaging service under the same name). ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ . ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ . AOL cut off access to AIM from third-party chat clients back in March, hinting at this eventual shutdown. People can download images they sent until December 15th, but the app\u2019s download links will start disappearing from now. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to save or port your buddy list.

VHighlights. A British fellow has agreed to have hacked a CIA official's computer . He has been found guilty of eight charges against him . He will be sentenced on December 15. A British teenager has admitted trying to hack into the computers of the director of the CIA and other US government officials. Kane Gamble pleaded guilty Friday to eight charges of attempting to "secure unauthorized access" to computers and two charges of unauthorised modification of computer material. Prosecutors say that in 2015-16, Gamble, now 18, targeted the computers of officials including then-FBI director Mark Giuliano, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and John Brennan, then head of the CIA. Reports at the time said a British teenager, part of a group of hackers called "Crackas With Attitude," had infiltrated Brennan's personal email account and posted details online.  Two American men have been jailed over the network's hacking. Gamble will be sentenced Dec. 15 at Leicester Crown Court in central England.

VThe University Grants Commission (UGC) has come up with a unique idea to fix all that ails higher education in India. Or at least what it thinks is the biggest problem that afflicts the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The statutory body, which is tasked with the coordination, determination and maintenance of standards of higher education, thinks that dropping "M" from AMU and "H" from BHU will help reflect the "secular character" of these prestigious institutions. What - or if at all - it does to the academic standards of universities is something the UGC has chosen not to answer. The suggestion, surprisingly, is contained in an audit of the AMU by a panel set up by the UGC on April 25 at the behest of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to probe complaints of irregularities against 10 central universities. The other universities that were audited by the UGC committees include Pondicherry University, Allahabad University, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand, Central University of Jharkhand, Central University of Rajasthan, Central University of Jammu, Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya in Wardha, University of Tripura and Hari Singh Gour University in Madhya Pradesh. The mandate of the five committees set up for the purpose was restricted to look into infrastructure, academic, research and financial operations. It is perhaps not so difficult to understand why a panel - tasked with assessing infrastructure - will get itself embroiled into debates as complicated as secular versus communal. Secular cleansing seems to be the order of the day. We are into an exercise of forming uniform identities, a nationalistic agenda that is raising its head with complete impunity and scant regard for India's historic cultural, religious and social ethos. At a time when the status of AMU's minority status is sub judice, it is politically expedient to speak in the same tone as that of the incumbent government which has backed an Allahabad High Court order denying the university a minority status. Of course, such a narrative can't differentiate between the minority status and secular character of an institution. We are into an exercise of forming uniform identities, a nationalistic agenda that is raising its head with complete impunity. Secular institutions ensure equality of treatment and opportunities for all their students, irrespective of their religious practices. Minority institutions seek a right to reserve their distinct religious identity without discriminating against any individual. It is only for the UGC to explain how a Muslim or Hindu in the name of an institution reflects that members of the other communities are being discriminated against or secularism being compromised. The fact that a statutory body tasked with ensuring high education standards in the country has chosen to indulge in a debate which is tearing apart the nation is a sad commentary on the state of affairs and an ominous sign for the days to come. It is sad UGC is drawing ridicule on social media for its misadventure. remove muslim from AMU, hindu from BHU. i do want to wake up to a national paper called 'The'.https://t.co/tTevEYibKv.  \u2014 Hartosh Singh Bal (@HartoshSinghBal) October 9, 2017 . State of education in India. Higher education in the country is ailing with problems such as low rate of enrolment, unequal access, poor quality of infrastructure and lack of relevance. The country has only about722 varsities, as against the National Knowledge Commission recommendation of 1,500. The gross enrolment rate (GER) in India was abysmally low at 24.5 per cent during 2015-16. There is no taking away from the fact that 24.5 percent during 2004-05 the GER for higher education in India was only 10 per cent. But for a country aspiring to be a global power, these numbers are dismal to say the least. Student to teacher ratios in most colleges and universities are low, but more distressing is the quality of the teachers that these institutions have. Meanwhile, private universities are mushrooming across the country. While everybody has a right to make profits in businesses, making a business out of education is tragic. Setting up of private universities requires enactments in the state assembly. This has resulted in a bizarre situation on the ground. In 2005, the Supreme Court struck down a law in the state of Chhattisgarh that recognised 112 private universities in one single year. Given the state of affairs, it does not need a genius to pinpoint where UGC's focus needs to be. It had an opportunity to fix things in some (if not all) universities, it has squandered it away by creating a controversy the country could have lived without. Names of institutions are spun in the history that develops to build them. They are symbols of the holistic identities that take ages to build. But names are also political tools - tools that create and negate legacies. The politics of name giving and name changing is also way of deflecting attention from solemn issues. At a time when UGC should be asking and answering questions about the research standards of our universities and colleges, about how our education is failing to match global standards, about why our students drop out simply because they can't cough up the fees, that the institution has chosen to answer questions on secularism is shocking. The UGC is perhaps oblivious to the fact that there are too many heads doing just that. It will be advisable for the UGC to bring its focus back to fixing academic issues.

VThinking of going blonde, blonder and blondest this summer? Now\u2019s the right time to do it. From a cluster of shades to celebrities like Britanny Snow, Ashley Greene to Anna Wintour and Julianne Hough, there are plenty of hues and stars to look at for inspiration. Ahead, read out some ways to conquer the era of blonde with our list of blonde bob hairstyles!. 1. Blonde Ombre:. Image: Getty. Ashley Greene sure knows how to make her blonde hairstyle stand out. At the CBGB Music and Film Festival, Greene\u2019s cool blonde bob looked full of perfection. We love her wheat blonde hair with subtle golden blonde highlights \u2013 warming up her skin tone radiantly. Pair your ombre bob with soft pastel makeup for a romantic look. 2. Platinum Blonde Bob:. Image: Getty. Want to do a major statement bob? Take your cue from the Anne Gorke fashion show\u2019s model, who has demonstrated a sleek bob with blunt bangs and the quirky, platinum blonde locks. Oh, and how can we forget the healthy shine of her bob? Nailed it. 3. Bright Honey Blonde:. Image: Getty. Bright. Classy and chic \u2013 this 20s-inspired retro waves, in Nicole Ritchie\u2019s bright honey blonde, is all kinds of awesome-sauce. The actress styles her show-stealing ombre shade into a glossy, flapper \u2018do for a flirty and feminine finish. 4. Sunflower Blonde:. Image: Getty. No-one does effortlessly chic blonde hairstyles better than Chloe Sevigny. This natural two-toned sunflower blonde has enhanced her blue eyes while keeping it natural for a glossy and healthy hair look. To recreate this look, pair your bob with minimal makeup and orange-red lips. 5. Wheat Blonde With Darkened Roots:. Image: Getty. Brittany Snow\u2019s tousled wheat blonde bob with darkened roots perfectly suits her elegant style and, impressively, it enhances out the colour in her blue eyes and that enviable skin. Snow\u2019s textured blonde bob haircut shows off her eye-catching hair color, and we love that her long bangs are swept to one side. 6. Light Ash Blonde:. Image: Getty. Always on vogue, and in style, dancer Julianne Hough once again proves that a light ash blonde works well against a flawless skin tone and a coral make-up look. We adore her not too ash, not too golden asymmetrical shaggy bob that gives plenty of textured and movement. Picture-perfect. 7. Dark Ash Blonde:. Image: Getty. The hairstyle colour of the season is dark ash blonde. Take inspiration from Anna Wintour, who looks gorgeous with her trademark pageboy bob. We love the perfect balance between her light and dark ash hues. And those bangs. They skim her cheekbones, accentuate her eyes and flatter her peachy skin. 8. Champagne Blonde:. Image: Getty. We were assured at The Ninth Annual UNICEF Snowflake Ball that Journalist Katie Couric has perfected warm blonde hue. The champagne tone gives her hair an ethereal glow and the side-swept curls add oomph to her mid-length bob. 9. Angled Bob In Caramel Highlights:. Image: Getty. Oh, Posh \u2013 angled, asymmetric, edgy, black or blonde; you can magically pull of anything when it comes to bob. At the 15th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards, the former Spice Girl flaunts her caramel highlights with a polished, angled bob that emphasises her brown eyes. For sleek hair like Victoria\u2019s, work some texturizing mousse into your locks and a flat iron, as well as some strong hold hairspray. Bravo! One can never go wrong with blonde angled bob hairstyles. 10. Golden Wheat:. Image: Getty. Actress Reese Witherspoon has got golden wheat blonde hairstyle we\u2019ve been lusting over for many days now. A striking warm colour that can soften any complexion, Reese\u2019s has nailed the medium, curly bob. With endless shades of a blonde spectrum to choose from, we hope our list of ten blonde bob hairstyles will help you find the perfect hue for your locks.

VLast month\u2019s video teaser for the upcoming Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds album, Who Built the Moon?, exuded strong psychedelic impressions, pitting inspirational chant and droning, spacey grooves against cosmically abstract animation. It seems fitting, then, that the first single from the Oasis founder\u2019s new record is titled after one of the most famous psychedelic movies of all time, Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s 1973 epic The Holy Mountain. The distorted, upbeat track (which seems to include no direct references to the film) sounds like bluesy, \u201cBack in the U.S.S.R.\u201d-pursuant rock from another dimension, complete with a \u201cwoo-oo-oo\u201d vocal borrowed from the bridge of that song and a catchy flute riff. As mentioned in the initial reports about the album, Paul Weller also guests on the track playing organ. In a press release, Gallagher said that he knew early on that the song would be the album\u2019s \u201cfirst single,\u201d and claimed that \u201cuntil the day I die, it will be one of my favourite pieces of music that I\u2019ve ever written. My kids love it, my friends\u2019 kids all love it and I am sure \u2018the kids\u2019 will love it.\u201d Listen to \u201cHoly Mountain\u201d below.

VLarge wildfires in northern California are causing havoc as hospitals, schools and businesses over a wide area are shut down and tens of thousands of residents are forced to evacuate due to several rapidly spreading blazes. Residents of the second-most densely populated area of America's most populated state woke up on Monday morning to dense smoke covering predawn skies, as high winds and hot temperatures saw multiple fast-moving wildfires explode in size, forcing widespread evacuations.  \u2014 Wilson Walker (@Wilson_Walker) October 9, 2017 . Following several days of hot temperatures, combined with Sunday night's sudden easterly high winds, at least 14 wildfires are currently burning out of control in the northern areas of the San Francisco/Bay Area region of northern California, filling the air with dense smoke and prompting residents to flood 9-1-1 emergency service phone lines to report the flames. California Governor Jerry Brown has issued a state of emergency for those counties currently at highest risk, according to multiple reports. As of 11 a.m. PST, at least 14 fires covering an aggregate of an estimated . 60,000 acres are currently burning out of control as fire fighting teams and emergency personnel from around the state rush to the region in what is now being described as one of the worst outbreaks in the state's history. Two large hospitals in Santa Rosa, the largest city in the northern Bay Area, have been evacuated and several nearby neighborhoods \u2014 including prominent hotel chain structures \u2014 have burned to the ground.  \u2014 Katie Nielsen (@KNielsenKPIX) October 9, 2017 . Firefighters currently overwhelmed with the battle are focusing on rescue and evacuation, leaving for now the fight to put out the blazes until residents and key infrastructure are secured. "We are in a life and preservation mode to get people out to safety," according to California Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox. "This fire is moving extremely quickly. It is very dynamic. This is a once-in-a-lifetime fire," stated Cox. The California Highway Patrol has shut down the two primary highways in the region while the National Weather Service has released a red-flag warning for the area until Tuesday, warning of continuing gusty winds and extremely dry conditions.  \u2014 Jackie Ward (@jackie_ward) October 9, 2017 .

V Are you drinking 8 glasses of water every day? If not, then now would be a good time to start. While not having sufficient water has many side-effects, it is equally important that we are mindful of 'how' this water is consumed. The principles of Ayurveda suggest that the way you choose to drink water also affects your overall health. Interesting, isn't it? Ancient Ayurveda has numerous theories regarding tips to drink water which have been followed over centuries. According to the book, The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies by Vasant Lad, water is the manifestation of consciousness. Water is fluid, heavy, soft, vicious, cold, dense and cohesive. It brings molecules together. Water is a chemical energy, which means it is a universal chemical solvent. Water exists in the body as plasma, cytoplasm, serum, saliva, nasal secretion, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and sweat. It is therefore necessary for absorption of nutrition and to maintain life; without it, our cells cannot survive. Considering how essential water is to human life, here are some handy yet important Ayurvedic tips to drink water. Ayurvedic Tips to Drink Water. 1. Sit Down to Drink Water Rather than Standing.  It is a good idea to always sit and drink water rather than standing. By standing and drinking, you disrupt the balance of fluids in the body and this may lead to a greater accumulation of fluids in the joints causing arthritis. By sitting and drinking, your muscles and nervous system is much more relaxed and helps the nerves to digest food and other fluids easily. Your kidneys also pace the filtration process while sitting. By standing and drinking water, you disrupt the balance of fluids in the body. 2. Avoid Chugging All the Water at Once.  Avoid gulping down large volumes of water in a single breath, rather take smaller sip, swallow, breathe and repeat throughout the day. This holds true while having your meals too. According to Ayurvedic expert, Dr. Akhilesh Sharma, "there are three doshas in the body - vata, pitta and kapha, and how you consume water must be in accordance with these doshas. People with vata prakruti should drink water only one hour after eating a meal. This will help their food digest in a better way. People with pitta prakruti can have small sips during meals to start their digestion process early and people with kapha prakurti should have water before taking meals so that they feel full and not eat more. This will help them lose weight easily.". Avoid gulping large volumes of water during meals and otherwise. 3. Drink Room Temperature water, Warm is Even Better.  Avoid ice chilled water that disturbs the ongoing process of digestion and puts off the fire. Cold water decreases the blood supply to various organs of the body further leading to constipation. Drinking tepid water can help in proper digestion and metabolism that promotes weight loss, relieves bloating and pain. According to Dr. Akhilesh, warm water helps in in controlling cholesterol levels and also keep the arteries clean. Avoid drinking chilled water as it disrupts the process of digestion. 4. Drink Only When You are Thirsty.  Your body sends signals to you when it is in dire need of water. Ayurveda emphasizes on drinking water only when you feel thirsty. Every person has a different body, hence, drinking the same amount of water cannot be recommended to everybody. The body cannot absorb too much water intake; therefore it is imperative to know the thirst cues your body gives you. Measure your own drinking system without feeling too full. Your body sends signals when it is in dire need of water. 5. Know the Indicators your Body Gives You When You are Thirsty.  Your body gives you cues to let you know it needs water. One being, the color of urine, dark yellow color may indicate dehydration, while fairly clear and straw colored urine is a sign of a hydrated and satiated body. Dry chapped lips are one of the indicators of a dehydrated body. Notice these cues as these may turn into health problems. Know the indicators that your body give you when it needs water. 6. Drink Water First Thing in the Morning.  Ayurveda suggests that is a healthy habit to drink water first thing in the morning, which is known as Ushapan. It helps get rid of many diseases in the body. Drinking water in the morning helps in flushing all the toxins in the body and cleanses your intestines. Start drinking water first thing in the morning. 7. Drink Water Stored in Silver and Copper Vessels.  Ayurveda has always suggested drinking water stored in copper (tamba) and silver (chaandi) vessels. The water stored in these vessels has the ability to balance all three doshas in the body and it does by positively charging the water. Dr. Akhilesh agrees and points out that copper has numerous antioxidants and anti-bacterial properties that help boost the immunne system of the body. It also has anti-cancer properties. Water in the silver vessel has the power to remove free radicals from the body and gives a cooling effect in the intestines and smoothens the process of digestion. The water stored in copper and silver vessels helps cure all doshas in your body. Important Tips for Drinking Water in Summer.  According to Dr. Keerti Gupta from Kirti Ayurvedic Hospital & Research Center, "Summer is called as the "Pitta Season" and afternoon time is Pitta Kaal, which is hottest time of the day, therefore, Ayurveda suggests that you should drink maximum water during this period so as to maintain the body temperature. You could also incorporate some small changes including adding Pitta pacifying ingredients in water that help maintain body heat. Some of the ingredients include lemon, mint, kokum, and fennel seeds,khaskhas and rose petals.

VFootball striker Gabriel Jesus has delivered an apparent boost to Argentina's hopes of securing an automatic berth in next year's World Cup by insisting Brazil will be playing to win their final qualifier against Chile on Tuesday. Five-time World Cup winners Brazil lead the COMMEBOL group standings with 38 points from 17 matches and are already guaranteed of a place in Russia, reports Xinhua news agency. . Argentina must win their final match in Peru just to secure a playoff spot, but could leapfrog third-placed Chile if Brazil win their clash at Sao Paulo's Allianz Parque. "We have played three matches since qualifying for the World Cup and that hasn't changed the seriousness with which we have been playing," Manchester City striker Jesus told a press conference on Sunday. "When you put on the Brazil shirt you always play to win.". When asked about the prospect of a World Cup without Argentina star Lionel Messi, Jesus replied: "Messi is one of the game's greatest ever players but we are just thinking about ourselves". Brazil centre-back Miranda was more forthright about the possibility that Argentina could miss the World Cup for the first time since 1970. "A World Cup without Brazil, Argentina and Germany loses its appeal a little," the Atletico Madrid defender said. "But each team thinks about their own situation.". "We were also going through a difficult time at the start of the (CONMEBOL tournament) and we were able to qualify on our own merit. Our obligation is always to win.".

VVIJAYAWADA: HRD Minister Ganta Srinivas Rao will table the Chakrapani committee report on student suicides in the Cabinet on Tuesday and recommend action against colleges that fail to follow the new guidelines to check such deaths. It is relevant to note that the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) had earlier issued a set of guidelines for all Intermediate colleges, both government-run and private, on measures to check suicidal tendencies among students. However, several college managements completely ignored the directions. The Education Department constituted a two-member committee comprising retired IAS officer D Chakrapani and former vice-chancellor of Sri Padmavati Mahila University Ratna Kumari to suggest guidelines on the prevention of suicides in junior colleges early this year. The body on May 4 submitted the recommendations to the BIE, which in turn issued circulars to all colleges in the state on June 23. There, however, is no mechanism in place to ensure that the norms are followed. The Cabinet is expected to formulate a method to bridge the gap between ideation and implementation. Since the past few years, there has been an increase in the number of suicides among intermediate students, more so in corporate colleges. The HRD Minister in the Budget Session of the Assembly admitted that 25 students of junior colleges had committed suicide in three years. Since September, four students took the extreme step in the state, of which three are from private colleges.  When contacted, the HRD Minister said the government was \u201cserious\u201d about the issue and necessary measures were being taken to prevent student suicides. \u201cThe committee we constituted to study the causes of student suicides and recommend preventive measures has submitted its report, which will be discussed in Cabinet. It\u2019s our turn to act,\u201d he said. Stating that academic pressure was one of the biggest reasons for students resorting to killing themselves, the Minister said they were focusing on promoting stress-free education. Startling figures. 25 inter student suicides in last three years. 19 of them were first year students. 11 of total 25 belonged to Krishna district. Since September, 4 deaths. Some of the guidelines. A counsellor shall be appointed for each college. Only one test per month per subject. Frequent shifting of students from one section to another based on performance should be stopped.

VActress Katrina Kaif has been roped in as the brand ambassador of eyewear company Lenskart. The actress will be the face of Lenskart for the next two years and would also feature in the brand's new campaign, said a statement. "I am delighted to be associated with Lenskart... It's very important for me to find synergies with my brand associations and I believe Lenskart resonates the same. Lenskart is a brand loved by Indian youth and this is a conscious effort to connect with the fashion savvy Indians," said the actress.  Commenting on the new campaign launch, Peyush Bansal, Founder and CEO, Lenskart.com says that the brand is all about fun, fashion, playfulness and friendliness -- and Katrina is the perfect fit. "Katrina, we feel, is all of this too naturally, hence a perfect fit and not a forced fit. We were looking for someone who naturally fits the Lenskart brand proposition of 'Addictive Playfulness'. Katrina fits this the most. Her song 'Kala chashma' was a phenomenal success and we think she will be really successful with the actual chashma (spectacles) as well," Bansal said.

VExploited by the racing industry, they're now being bled for profit in Texas. By any measure, Jasper\u2019s got it good, but he hasn\u2019t always led \u201cthe life of Riley.\u201d. Like most greyhounds, he was used, abused and discarded by the notorious dog-racing industry. When he was \u201cretired\u201d following a leg injury after just a year of racing, he was severely underweight, riddled with internal parasites and suffering from serious dental neglect. He was terrified of men and is still skittish around them. Today, Jasper weighs a healthy 90 pounds and lives with my friend and her three cats in a cozy house with a spacious yard in Norfolk, Virginia. He never misses a walk, sees the vet regularly, is best friends with another greyhound, and eats better than I do\u2013he even gets fruit smoothies for breakfast. Best of all, he has someone who loves him\u2014something that every dog deserves. The approximately 150 greyhounds who are being held captive in an old shed in Cherokee, Texas, don\u2019t experience anything close to love. Like Jasper, most were treated as commodities by an industry that cares only about profits. But unlike him, they\u2019re still being denied exercise, companionship and the chance to bond with a human family\u2014everything that makes life meaningful to them. Instead, these graceful, sweet-tempered dogs are routinely abused by another self-serving profiteer: The Pet Blood Bank, Inc., a dog-blood factory farm that sells their blood to veterinary supply companies. A PETA exposé revealed that the greyhounds are snared with a crude catchpole and put in crates for hours\u2014often while muzzled and without access to water in the blazing-hot Texas sun\u2014before finally being taken into a trailer to be bled. After losing up to 20 percent of their blood volume, many are so weak that they have to be carried back to the squalid, dirt-floored wire cages and the old chemical tanks that serve as their \u201cshelter.\u201d They stay there, usually all alone, until they\u2019re bled again. Deprived of any enrichment or activity, they chew on the tanks, leaving sharp, jagged edges that can cut and puncture their thin skin. Many of them pace and spin in circles\u2014clear signs of severe psychological distress. Others cry out when approached or are so terrified that they cower and lose control of their bladders or bowels. Veterinary care for them is nonexistent. The nails of many of these dogs are so overgrown that they curl around into their paw pads, causing them to limp. Many suffer from severe gingivitis and receding gums, which make eating difficult. In a crude attempt to control ticks and other parasites, workers spray the dogs with an insecticide meant for buildings and trees, blistering their skin and irritating their eyes. Two greyhounds, who had no access to water, were found dead in their kennels. But this blood factory isn\u2019t the only place where \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d is being abused and exploited. About four hours to the east, in College Station, experimenters at Texas A&M University deliberately breed golden retrievers to develop muscular dystrophy. Ravaged by the muscle-wasting disease, they are isolated in barren metal cages and struggle to swallow even thin gruel. These experiments have been going on for more than 30 years and haven\u2019t produced even one effective treatment for the disease in humans. Across the country, puppy mills\u2014mass-breeding factories that put profits before animal welfare\u2014supply pet stores with animals who are often ill and unsocialized, while millions of dogs languish in animal shelters, waiting to be adopted. And greyhounds are still forced to run for their lives on racing tracks in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia. It shakes me to the core to imagine my own pups, Max, Danny, and Turk, being abused in these ways. But simply holding them close and wishing that other dogs were treated as well as they are doesn\u2019t cut it, not when we can protest, write letters, sign petitions and attend city council meetings to demand that all dogs get the respect and loving homes that they deserve. If we don\u2019t, who will?. Photo: Pixabay.

VAre you a fan of Ryan Phillippe? I am. As an actor, he\u2019s been in the public eye for nearly 25-years, appearing on various television shows and in movies. Currently, Phillippe is the star of USA\u2019s Shooter; an action-packed series where he plays the part of a retired veteran coaxed back into work so that he can save the lives of others. I\u2019m the first to admit the show is high on testosterone and violent. Still, I kind of dig it because the plot is always changing. But that\u2019s not what this post is really about. Instead, I\u2019d like to briefly focus your awareness on a recent disclosure Phillippe made about his battle with depression; something men almost never talk about [see post about men and depression]. Here\u2019s what he shared in a recent interview:. \u201cI believe that depression and mood disorders are on a spectrum akin to the way autism is, where it\u2019s an individual experience. I think people fear being stigmatized or treated in a blanket fashion, which is sometimes the response to someone who says, \u2018I struggle with depression.\u2019. But really, depression could manifest in a thousand different ways depending on who it is. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason not to talk about it. We can help each other cope and give tools that we learn along the way.\u201d. didja hear the one about. A post shared by ryan (@ryanphillippe) on Feb 26, 2016 at 11:26am PST. As part of his approach to health, Phillippe also disclosed that he struggles with patience. To cope, he uses mindful techniques, including self-compassion. \u201cI talk to myself quite often. I\u2019m constantly talking things through in my head. I took a trip to Thailand, and I had such an amazing experience. Since then I\u2019ve been reading a ton of Eastern philosophy about giving up some of the superficial things we\u2019re attached to, which I\u2019m trying to do. I also have issues with patience and depression, and I\u2019m thinking about how to focus and steady myself and be kinder and better.\u201d. What\u2019s impressive here is that Phillippe, whose role on Shooter is anything but touchy-feely, has no problem being transparent about his mental health challenges. In many ways, the actor serves as a positive example to people everywhere (particularly men) about the importance of self-care. Moreover, he shines a light on how mindfulness can support whole person wellness. In my book, that\u2019s pretty cool. \u2014.
