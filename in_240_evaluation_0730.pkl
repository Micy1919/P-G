S'The new bill would gradually roll back the program, a move that some Republicans warn could lead to millions losing coverage._line_ WASHINGTON: Two more US Republican senators announced their opposition Monday to their party\'s efforts to revamp Obamacare, derailing the controversial legislation in its current form and potentially dealing a monumental setback to President Donald Trump. _line_ Republican leaders are desperate for a major legislative victory this year -- and keen to fulfill Trump\'s campaign pledge to dismantle the 2010 health care reforms of his predecessor Barack Obama, formally called the Affordable Care Act. _line_ But they had no votes to spare. _line_ Republicans control 52 of the chamber\'s 100 seats. Democrats are united against the controversial legislation, while Republicans Susan Collins and Rand Paul declared their opposition last week. _line_ So when Senate conservatives Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announced late Monday they could not support the bill, the news sent shockwaves across Washington. _line_ "We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy," Moran -- who faced considerable opposition at home in Kansas to the measure -- said in a statement, adding that the new bill "fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address health care\'s rising costs." _line_ For Lee, "in addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn\'t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations." _line_ Their defections mean that the bill has no chance of even getting a vote on the Senate floor unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to make significant changes to woo skeptics back into the fold. _line_ "Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!" Trump tweeted after Lee and Moran made their opposition known. _line_ Over the weekend, McConnell delayed a vote to proceed on the bill, after Senator John McCain, 80, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot above his eye and said he would recuperate at home in Arizona for at least a week. _line_ But McCain\'s absence is now something of a moot point. _line_ Several Republicans had already expressed concern that the new bill could slash funding for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled. _line_ The new bill would gradually roll back the program, a move that some Republicans warn could lead to millions losing coverage. _line_ The latest defections also show that conservatives are frustrated that the new bill does not repeal the Obamacare taxes. _line_ As Republicans grappled with the collapse -- the second major stumble on the legislation in a mont -- Democratic reaction was swift. _line_ "This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable," said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer. _line_ "Rather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our health care system." _line_ Republican leaders are eager to notch a major victory for Trump in Congress as he nears the six-month mark of his presidency later this week, but health care is now unlikely to be that achievement. _line_ And while tax reform and infrastructure are also high priorities that Congress could address, they will need to take a back seat for now to a logjam of must-finish business in the Senate, including consideration of raising the limit on federal borrowing. _line_ Some fear that repealing Obamacare could adversely impact millions of Americans on Medicaid, or make health costs soar for people with pre-existing conditions. _line_ There is little institutional support for the bill, and even less for an amendment introduced by Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to offer bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare\'s coverage requirements. _line_ The chief executives of America\'s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association called it "simply unworkable in any form." _line_ A Post poll released Sunday showed Americans preferred Obamacare to the Republican plan by 50 percent to 24 percent. _line_ Despite the Republican setback, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said his rivals will take another bite at the health care apple. _line_ "There\'s a couple wheels off the bus right now," Murphy told MSNBC after the announcement from Lee and Moran. _line_  But "they are not going to give up on it," he added. _line_'

S'When was the last time you checked your smartphone? If you\'re like most people, it\'s probably sitting next to you right now. Or it may even already be in your hand._line_Mobile use has exploded in the last few years, with more people than ever relying on their smartphones for everything from Googling random facts to researching the best products to buy._line_"Billions of times per day, consumers turn to Google for I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do, I-want-to-buy moments," Jerry Dischler, VP of product management at AdWords, told me. "And, at these times, consumers are increasingly picking up their smartphones for answers."_line_Google has a name for these moments: micro-moments. These are split seconds of time where consumers use their devices to act on a need. And this small window of opportunity offers huge potential for your brand._line_Because 70 percent of mobile searches lead to timely action, your brand needs to be ready to ensure that the action your consumers take involves your brand. Making sure your content is easily found, accessible and relevant will help your brand capitalize on these micro-moments and make them work for you. Here are four steps to do just that:_line_1. Understand your consumer._line_Before you can begin creating content, you need to first know what your consumers want. Who are they? What do they look like? Research their habits, preferences and demographics to get a sense of the type of person you are trying to attract to your brand._line_Then, consider what types of questions they would ask before purchasing your product or service. Creating content that answers these questions will make it more likely that consumers will turn to your brand in those micro-moments._line_2. Anticipate micro-moments._line_Research shows that companies that take steps toward becoming "moments-ready" realize higher ROI in both mobile and overall marketing investment. To be moments-ready, yourself, understand when, where and why micro-moments occur for your consumer and how your brand fits in._line_This goes back to those questions consumers ask before a purchase. For example, someone might do a Google search for the best pizza in New York City. Pizza restaurants located in the Big Apple, therefore, need to be ready for that micro-moment and do everything they can to ensure the consumer chooses their brand._line_"It is in these moments that preferences are shaped and decisions are made," Richard Flanagan, head of business marketing for Google Australia and New Zealand, told me._line_There are tons of potential moments that could matter to your brand. It\'s impossible to capitalize on all of them, so how do you choose? It goes back to your consumers and what they want. Don\'t think just about the moment before they buy. Your brand should be there across the entire customer journey, so that at each stage, your relationship with the consumer grows stronger._line_3. Be relevant._line_So, how do you make sure your brand shows up in a consumer\'s micro-moment? There are a number of factors involved, including following search-engine optimization best practices, but the main factor is the content you create._line_Not only do you need to answer the right questions with your content, you need to ensure the content is easily digestible. It should be easy for your consumers to find the answers they\'re looking for. You also need to make sure your content is educational and not too promotional._line_With so little time to get your content across, if you can\'t provide what your audience members want, they\'ll turn to the next brand that can. In fact, 51 percent of smartphone users have purchased from a company or brand other than the one they intended to because the information those competitors provided was useful._line_You also need to focus on the distribution of your content. It\'s not enough to create a brilliant piece of content if no one can find it. Make sure you\'re sharing content on the channels where your audience is._line_4. Focus on the experience._line_"With more computing power in our pockets than most of us had on our desks just a few years ago, our expectations have been massively raised. We expect everything right, and we expect it right away," said Lisa Gevelber, vice president of marketing at Google._line_Leveraging micro-moments isn\'t just about creating the right kind of content. It\'s also about ensuring that your consumer\'s experience with a piece of content is as easy and smooth as possible._line_You need to focus on creating a positive mobile experience with your brand. That means streamlining the process of downloading the piece of content and eliminating as many steps as possible. If consumers have to fill out an outrageously long form to get the information they need, they will quickly lose interest -- and go somewhere else._line_Next Article_line_The 5 Traits (Some Surprising) I Look for When Hiring New Workers_line_Sujan Patel_line_'

S'FREMONT, Calif. - Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Friday the Model 3 had over half a million advance reservations as he handed over the first 30 to employee buyers, setting the stage for the biggest test yet of the company\'s strategy to become a profitable, mass market electric car maker._line_Outside Tesla\'s Fremont, California factory, Musk showed off the $35,000 base vehicle with a range of 220 miles (350 km) on a charge that marks a departure from the company\'s earlier luxury electric cars._line_Hours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be "quite a challenge" to build the car during the early days of production._line_"We\'re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell," Musk told journalists._line_The over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits. Any new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said._line_A longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a 15-inch touchstream display to the right of the driver._line_Tesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production._line_Were Tesla to produce, and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States._line_Production delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla\'s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year. Musk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems._line_Tesla has burned through over $2 billion in cash so far this year ahead of the launch. A troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations._line_Tesla\'s share price has surged 54 percent since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla\'s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co._line_Until now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman CEO who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account. Now loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the United States._line_The Model 3 is part of Musk\'s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems._line_(Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Joe White and Lisa Shumaker)_line_'

S"Other than everyday cleansing, toning and moisturizing, the skin also needs detoxification. Detoxification is an additional beauty approach on the skin such that all its dirt and dust content is extracted and washed off._line_Every day when we wash or clean our face and body, the topical layer of dirt and dust gets cleared. With skin detoxification, a deep cleaning is done that clears off the existing layers of pollutants on the skin cells and tissues._line_We have listed a few recommended natural ingredients that you can use to do skin detoxification right at home._line_ Use these natural ingredients to detoxify your skin every alternate week and in a month's time, you will see a big difference in the skin texture and complexion. Take a look._line_Jojoba Oil_line_To detoxify your skin with jojoba oil, first, moisturize your skin with a spoon of jojoba oil. Wait for five minutes till the oil sets in your skin cells and pores. Use a neat cotton pad to wipe off the jojoba oil from your skin._line_Curd_line_The second ingredient in the list is curd which is very simple to get. You can use curd for skin detoxification on an everyday basis. Always use hung curd, and massage it all over your face and skin for at least 15 minutes and then wash off. Do not compromise on the amount of curd, as less of it will make it tough to massage all over._line_Tomato and Sugar_line_The tomato and sugar work like a scrub for the skin that clears all clogged skin pores and cells. Cut half a tomato, take one slice and a bowl of granular sugar. Dab the sugar on the tomato and scrub your skin with this. On one hand, the tomato juice will moisturize and soften your skin and on the other, the sugar will exfoliate._line_Sugar and Lemon_line_Among the natural detoxifiers of the skin, another scrub recipe is sugar and lemon. Squeeze lemon juice first in a bowl. Add granular sugar to it such that both are consistently mixed. Now using your hands, scrub it especially on the blackheads and whiteheads. Please note, do not scrub on the skin with pimples, acne or rash._line_Yeast and Lemon_line_This is a skin detoxifying pack in which you have to combine two ingredients - yeast and lemon. In a tablespoon of yeast, mix three to five tablespoons of lemon juice. Apply and wait for it to dry and then wash off using lukewarm water. You will instantly see the detoxification result on your skin._line_Basil Toner_line_In the skin detoxification process, you can also use a toner. The good part about toner is, after preparing, these can be preserved in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Coming to basil toner, the preparation is very simple, you have to blend fresh basil leaves in the blender and then, use a strainer to collect the fresh toner. For complete skin detoxification, soak a cotton pad in the basil toner and then, massage it all over your skin and face._line_Cucumber Toner_line_For this one blend cucumber pieces, strain and collect the toner. This can also be preserved in the refrigerator. The best part about cucumber toner is, it has versatile uses, that is, the same can be applied on the under-eye area to remove dark skin as well. Spraying cucumber toner every day before makeup also acts as a light primer. So, once you make the cucumber toner, there is no way you can waste it._line_Almond, Sugar, Cream And Olive Oil_line_In this skin detoxifier, you will require two kinds of sugar - white and brown in the same ratio. To the sugar mix, add crushed almond and mix the three ingredients. Lastly, make it into a paste by adding some olive oil to it. This cannot be preserved for future use and should be used as fresh as possible. Also, after massaging this on the skin, allow it dry for a minimum of 15 minutes._line_"

S'Delhi panel contradicts NGT, says AoL event wasn\'t held on Yamuna wetlands_line_ The Tribunal had also said that the action plan should refer to the recommendations of an expert committee it had appointed to assess the damage at the Yamuna floodplains. _line_There was no evidence of compaction of soil neither were any wetlands seen prior to and after the Art of Living Foundation\'s event in March 2016 on the Yamuna floodplains, a Delhi Development Authority (DDA)-led three-member panel submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday. Last week, the NGT\'s principal bench had directed the DDA to form a three-member committee and submit an action plan to restore the Yamuna floodplains. The Tribunal had also said that the action plan should refer to the recommendations of an expert committee it had appointed to assess the damage at the Yamuna floodplains._line_The three-member panel\'s observations though, were directly in contradiction to the observations of the expert committee. "The land where the function of AoL was held is fully covered with grass along with some saplings and seedlings of various tree species here and there. This kind of grass and natural regeneration of seedlings is not possible on compacted soil. No significant size of wetland or water body was noticed by the committee in the area used by AoL," the panel report said. It added that from Google Earth images, it was evident that no wetland or water body was seen prior to the event._line_The report of the three-member panel was prepared by Principal Commissioner, Horticulture, DDA, Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, Delhi government, and Chief Engineer, Yamuna Irrigation Department, Uttar Pradesh._line_The NGT-appointed expert committee, though, had said in its report that wetlands were filled up during preparations for the event. "About 75 hectares were impacted due to levelling and consolidation and compacting...wetlands have to be de-silted and the compacted area has to be de-compacted," the expert committee had said in April. They had said that Rs 42 crore was required for physical and biological rehabilitation of the floodplains._line_'

S'As a parent, raising successful -- and happy -- kids is your primary job. Here\'s how the process starts._line_Ask parents what they want for their kids, and almost all will say they want their children to be happy. But ask what traits they want their children to possess -- ask what traits they hope to instill in their kids -- and far and away the number one quality is "to be responsible." What comes next on the list? The ability to work hard._line_Oddly enough, responsibility and hard work provide the perfect recipe for happiness: When you achieve your goals, when you feel fulfilled, when your life has meaning -- that\'s a wonderful definition of happiness._line_We all want our kids to be successful, in whatever pursuit they choose._line_But while the destination may be different, the actual path to success is very similar. Success starts with mindset: the right perspective, the right outlook, the right motivation, and a real sense of purpose._line_That\'s why it is so important to help your kids remember what they need to do, every day, to stay on the path to reaching their individual dreams._line_Want to help your kids be successful? Work to impart the following lessons. Not only will you help them today, but they will carry them through the rest of their lives, no matter where their hopes and dreams may take them._line_1. Teach them that the unknown is never as scary as it seems._line_The most paralyzing fear is fear of the unknown. (At least it is for me.)_line_Yet few things turn out to be as hard or scary as we think. Plus, it\'s incredibly exciting to overcome a fear. You get that "I can\'t believe I just did that!" rush, a thrill you may not have experienced for a long time._line_Every day, do something a little scary, whether physically or emotionally. Then, trust that you will figure out how to overcome any problems that arise._line_Because you will._line_And if you don\'t, we\'ll help you._line_2. Teach them to do what other people are not willing to do._line_Often the easiest way to be different is to do the things other people don\'t want to._line_Pick one thing other people won\'t do. It can be simple or small. Whatever it is, do it. You\'ll instantly be a little different from the rest of the pack._line_Then keep going. Every day think of one thing to do that no one else is willing to do._line_After a week you\'ll be uncommon. After a month you\'ll be special. After a year you\'ll be incredible, and you definitely won\'t be like anyone else._line_3. Teach them to look below the surface to be a good friend._line_Sometimes your friends are hesitant. Sometimes they\'re insecure. Sometimes they\'re shy. Whatever the reason, sometimes they\'ll ask a different question than the one they really want you to answer._line_One friend might ask whether you think he is a good basketball player. What he really wants to know is whether you think he should try out for the team; he hopes you\'ll say he should, and he hopes you\'ll share the reasons why._line_Another friend might ask if she should take AP Physics. What she really wants to know is if you think she\'s smart enough to go to a great college, or even work in science. She hopes you do, and she\'ll love when you share the reasons why._line_Behind many questions is an unasked question._line_Pay attention so you can answer that question too, because that is the answer the other person doesn\'t just want, but needs._line_That\'s a great way to be a great friend._line_4. Teach them that achieving a huge goal always starts with one small step._line_You have ideas. You have plans. You have goals. That\'s great. But you don\'t actually have anything until you do something._line_People let hesitation and uncertainty stop them from acting on their dreams. Pick one plan, one goal, or one idea. And get started. Just take one small step._line_The first step is by far the hardest. Every successive step will be a lot easier._line_5. Teach them to live the life they want to live._line_Most of the time, it\'s healthy to worry about what other people think, but not if it stands in the way of living the life you really want to live._line_If you really want to do something but you\'re worried that other people might say you\'re crazy, do it anyway. Pick one thing you haven\'t tried because you\'ve been concerned about what other people think or say, and just go do it._line_Your true friends will be proud of you._line_Better yet, you will be proud of you. That\'s the best pride of all._line_6. Teach them how fun it is to be the underdog._line_I\'m ashamed to admit it, but one of the best ways to motivate me is to insult me -- or for me to manufacture a way to feel insulted, regardless of whether I\'m actually justified in feeling that way or not._line_"Justified" is not the point. Finding motivation to prove that person wrong, and, more important, to achieve what I want to achieve, is all that matters._line_Call it artificial competition or manufactured anger; call it childish and immature; call it creating perceived insults -- whatever you call it, it works for me. (Hey, it was good enough for Michael Jordan.)_line_And it can work for you. So embrace being an underdog. That will help you try harder._line_7. Teach them that "good" is the best way to get to "great."_line_I know. You hear all the time how you only get one chance to make a first impression. You hear all the time how perfection is the only acceptable outcome._line_Unfortunately, nothing is ever perfect. No one is ever perfect. The people who come close are the people who work hard, do the best they can, and let it go. The people who care about you will tell you how you can improve, and that means you\'ll get to make improvements that actually matter to people, and eventually overcome any shortcomings._line_8. Teach them to own their failures._line_Ask your friends why they got an A in a class. Their answers will be filled with personal pronouns: "I" and "me."_line_Ask your friends why they failed a class. Their answers will be filled with stories about other people: their teachers, the material, the schedule. They\'ll say it was because of someone or something else. It\'s always someone else_line_And that\'s a problem, because when you distance yourself, you can\'t learn from your failures._line_Occasionally something completely outside your control will cause you to fail. Most of the time, though, it\'s you. And that\'s OK. In fact, that\'s great. Every successful person has failed numerous times. Most of them have failed a lot more often than you can imagine That\'s why they\'re successful now._line_Embrace every failure: Own it, learn from it, and take full responsibility for making sure that next time, you\'ll make sure things turn out differently._line_9. Teach them to help other people feel good about themselves._line_All around you are people who work hard with little or no recognition. Be the person who recognizes at least one of them, every day._line_Not only will you give respect, you\'ll earn it -- the respect that comes from making a difference, however fleeting, in another person\'s life, which is the best kind of respect there is._line_10. Teach them to trust the power of hard work._line_Like Jimmy Spithill, skipper of America\'s Cup-winning Team Oracle USA, says, "Rarely have I seen a situation where doing less than the other guy is a good strategy."_line_Compared to other people you may not be as smart, as athletic, as outgoing, or as confident.... but you can always outthink, outhustle, and outwork everyone else._line_Even when everything seems stacked against you, effort and persistence are on your side -- and often they are the only things you truly need._line_You don\'t always have to be first. Sometimes all you have to do is be the last person still trying._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_'

That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, since diabetes cases have increased four-fold since 1980._line_After crunching the numbers from 145 studies including over 88,000 men who averaged 56 years old, the researchers determined that those with diabetes were more than three times as likely to have erectile dysfunction than healthy guys were.

S'One of the core concepts in the digital marketing industry is the sales funnel. While odd sounding at first, this single core concept can take a business from virtually non-existent and unknown to multi-million-dollar marketing machine with mass saturation, seemingly overnight. In fact, there are skilled practitioners who have built a career around implementing this single concept in business. _line_If you\'re wondering what a sales funnel is, simply imagine a real-world funnel. At the top of that funnel, some substance is poured in, which filters down towards one finite destination. In sales, something similar occurs. At the top, lots of visitors arrive who may enter your funnel. However, unlike the real-world funnel, not all who enter the sales funnel will reemerge out from the other end. _line_In marketing automation, Ryan Deiss, co-founder of Digital Marketer, often describes the sales funnel as a multi-step, multi-modality process that moves prospective browsers into buyers. It\'s multi-stepped because lots must occur between the time that a prospect is aware enough to enter your funnel, to the time when they take action and successfully complete a purchase. _line_There are email warming sequences that include things like personalized value-driven stories, tutorials and even soft pushes to webinars, and of course product suggestions that happen over days or even weeks. The truth is that most prospects won\'t buy from your website at first glance, especially if they\'re only just becoming aware of you today. It takes time. Thus, the funnel is a multi-modality process, as there are a variety of relationship-building experiences and "touches" that occur through several stages. _line_Much of this is steeped in buyer psychology. The best marketers in the world know that there is a psychological process that must occur for prospects to whip out those credit cards and turn into buyers or even hyper-active buyers. One such person whose perfected this process is Russell Brunson, an "underground entrepreneur" who founded a company called ClickFunnels, a sales funnel SaaS business that empowers marketers from around the world to build marketing automation without all the hassle. _line_As a software engineer myself, I can tell you that building funnels from an application standpoint takes massive amounts of work. There\'s a great deal of coding and integration that\'s required here. From email systems to landing page implementations to credit card processing APIs, and everything in between, so many platforms need to "talk," that it takes the bar too high for the average marketer. _line_However, what Brunson cleverly conceived with ClickFunnels is to create a SaaS that can integrate with the world\'s most popular platforms and virtually anyone can quietly launch a funnel in hours as opposed to weeks of hefty coding and programming. As a fervent user of ClickFunnels myself, I can tell you that the system is impressive beyond measure._line_Understanding Sales Funnels_line_To better understand the concept of a sales funnel and just how you can implement it in your own business, let\'s look at the following image from Shutterstock. On the left side of the image, you see a magnet. That magnet is attracting customers, which happens a number of ways. From blogging to social media to paid ads and everything in between, how the visitors arrive to your website has some impact on the success of your funnel. _line_Stage 1: Awareness_line_What\'s more important about the sales funnel is what happens when those visitors (we can call them prospects) actually do arrive. Through a variety of means, many of which you\'ve already seen, such as email newsletter signups, ebook downloads, online quizzes and more, those prospects enter into your sales funnel through an enticing offer. _line_The goal of your entire sale funnel and platform is to solve your customer\'s problem. When you know the problem, and you build content to draw them in, then offer them a product or service to solve their problem, that\'s when the real magic happens. However, getting to that stage takes work and you have to garner their awareness first. _line_Once the prospect is in the proverbial funnel, you\'ve peaked their awareness. That\'s the first stage of the funnel. However, getting a prospect aware of you is no simple feat. Depending upon how they\'ve arrived to your website (organically or through a paid ad), those customers might view your funnel differently and your opt-in rates will vary significantly. _line_For example, when a customer finds you organically through a Google search for example, that means you have some element of authority. When you have authority, prospects are more likely to enter into your funnel because they know that if they found you relevantly, that whatever it is that you\'re providing must be of a great value. That\'s just the nature of SEO and organic search. _line_Of course, regardless of how they enter into your funnel, your goal as a marketer is to move them through the multiple stages that will take them from prospect to buyer. And once they\'re aware of you, you need to build their interest. To do this, you need to establish a relationship with the customer. You might have enticed them with a great offer (lead magnet) to grab their email address, but actually moving them through the funnel is a far greater challenge. _line_The truth? People are smart. They\'re not simply going to buy anything from anyone unless they feel there\'s an immense amount of value to be had there. Thus, your funnel needs to built that value and bake it in through a variety of means. But most importantly, you have to create a strong bond with your prospect, and that happens by being relatable, honest and transparent in your email warming sequence._line_Stage 2: Interest_line_You gain the prospects interest through an email sequence. You begin to relate stories to them that tie into who you are and how you\'ve arrived to this point in your life. Brunson, in his book, Expert Secrets, calls this the Attractive Character. Are you the reluctant hero whose journey happened almost by mistake, but you feel like you owe it to yourself and the world to convey something of great value?_line_Or, are you a leader, an adventurer or an evangelist? How you position yourself is entirely up to you, but your message must be consistent throughout your entire "pitch" and it needs to be steeped in the truth. Your backstory, and just how you convey that through parables, character flaws and polarity, has much to do with just how well you can "hook" in your prospects to create a mass movement._line_Of course, implementing this isn\'t easy. You need to first develop your stories, then decide on how you\'re going to convey those stories and at what drip-rate. For example, your first email or two might go out on the day they first signup, then one email per day might go out afterwards. How much of that will be story-based and how much will be pitches?_line_In a recent conversation I had with Perry Belcher, co-founder of Native Commerce Media, he told me that you also need to train your prospects to click on links. For example, you could have them click on a link of what interests them or link them to a blog post or eventually to a product or service that you\'re selling, but you need to train them to build a habit of clicking on those links from the very beginning._line_Stage 3: Decision_line_The next stage is the decision. Getting prospects to make a decision isn\'t easy. The best way to get them there? Beyond the art of story telling, copywriting and building the habit of link-clicking, you need to have lots and lots of customer reviews and testimonials. This is one of the most powerful ways that you can get people to take action._line_Of course, if you\'re going the paid ad route, you could also use Facebook and Google re-targeting to keep that awareness and interest level high. For example, if you\'ve ever noticed after leaving a particular website, that you begin to see their ad everywhere, there\'s a particular reason for that. Especially if they\'ve already entered your sales funnel, this is a very powerful way to get them to act._line_For example, you could show them re-targeting ads that have video testimonials or reviews by other customers. If you have media publications that have written about you, you could take that opportunity to highlight those. When they see this in your sales funnel and you follow them around with re-targeting, it\'s simply an added element of exposure._line_But however you get them to decide to act, flipping that switch isn\'t simple. You need to present them with a great opportunity and use Robert Cialdini\'s 6 principles, outlined in his 1984 book, Influence, in one way or another to move them through this stage: _line_Principle of reciprocity -- This is achieved by delivering lots of value, either through whatever it is that you provided them as a free offer (lead magnet) in the very beginning, or in an ongoing exchange through your emails. _line_Principle of commitment & consistency -- When people commit to something, they\'re far more likely to purchase from you. That\'s why getting them to agree to something like a free + shipping offer or by agreeing with something you\'ve said in some way. This is a powerful principle in sales and if you pay attention to some of the best marketers in the world, you\'ll notice that they work fervently to get your commitment to something, even if it\'s very small in the beginning. _line_Principle of liking -- When people like you (i.e. they relate to your stories) they are more likely to purchase something from you. How well you craft your story and convey that to your prospects is going to play a big role in whether they decide to act or not. _line_Principle of authority -- How much authority do your products or services have? Are their respected people in your community that have endorsed it? Scientific studies that are backing it? Are you yourself an authority? All these elements come into play in this process. _line_Principle of social proof -- Do you have social proof? Are people on social media raving or talking about how great your products or services are? Do you have some other type of social proof? Best-selling books? Something else? It\'s importnat that you present this to prospects if you do have them. _line_Principle of scarcity -- How much scarcity have you baked into your email sequence? Again, people are smart, but when you apply the principle of scarcity, as in there are only a limited amount of some offer or time left before a discount expires or slots available for an online class, it entices people to take action._line_Stage 4: Action_line_The final stage of the sales funnel is the action that you\'re intending them to perform. In most cases this is the purchase. Again, how well you move them through the various stages is going to set you up with a specific conversion for this action. For example, if 100 people click on your offer and 10 people enter your sales funnel but only purchase people purchase, then you have a 2 percent conversion. _line_However, the best part about this, and the most powerful route that entrepreneurs take to scale their businesses, is that if you know that sending 100 people to your site costs you $200, for example, but you get two people to convert at $300 each, then you have a $600 return on $200 invested (300 percent). When you know that, that\'s when the entire game changes and you can infinitely scale your offers._line_This how the world\'s smartest marketers scale out their businesses. They know the conversion value and they\'ve tweaked and perfected their sales funnels, so they go after this with a vengeance by simply scaling out their offers. If you know that, by investing $1 you\'re going to get $3 back, you will infinitely invest $1 repeatedly. Get the point?_line_However, getting to this stage is no simple feat. It takes an enormous amount of work and effort plus tracking. By implementing sales funnel software, such as the platform built by Brunson, you can definitely cut down the headache, but there\'s still lots of work to be done. Copy needs to be written, tracking pixels need to be installed and email sequences need to be created. But that\'s what it takes to succeed._line_Think about that the next time you\'re building out a sales funnel. This complex and intricate concept in business can literally take you from a complete unknown to a global powerhouse quickly through the art of scaling out a highly-converting offer. Don\'t try to take shortcuts or implement hacks, and put in the time if you\'re looking to eventually reap the benefits and results._line_Next Article_line_10 Passionate Business Ideas for Your Next Startup_line_R.L.

S'Lockheed Martin will build a deep space habitat inside a space shuttle cargo container._line_If humans are ever really going to make it to Mars, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a bigger boat._line_Today\xe2\x80\x99s spaceships are built for short hauls to and from the International Space Station, a mere six or so hours away. These ships, like the Russian Soyuz, SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s Dragon, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming Orion capsule, are small, cramped, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have bathrooms or sleeping quarters. These space canoes simple won\xe2\x80\x99t do for nine-month ride to Mars. That\xe2\x80\x99s why NASA has commissioned six companies to research designs larger deep space habitats that will put the ship into spaceship._line_Lockheed Martin is one of the companies that\xe2\x80\x99s developing a concept for NASA, and on Thursday it announced plans to build a life-size prototype of its Deep Space Gateway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida._line_This prototype won\xe2\x80\x99t fly into space, but it will help the company to refine its design. \xe2\x80\x9cForm, fit and function are key,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Pratt, Lockheed\xe2\x80\x99s habitat program manager told PopSci via email, \xe2\x80\x9cso we will be exploring the critical elements needed in this section of a larger deep space gateway to ensure functionality for the astronauts.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_To build it, the company will refurbish an old cargo container named Donatello, which was used to carry supplies to the ISS in the shuttle era. (The container\xe2\x80\x99s siblings, made by the Italian Space Agency, are Leonardo, Raffaello.) It will take about 18 months to refurbish the roughly 22-foot-long, 15-foot-diameter metal can._line_\xe2\x80\x9cThe main objective is to ensure astronauts can utilize the space efficiently in combination with other elements of a full architecture,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pratt, although he admits there will be some limitations, since the astronauts won\xe2\x80\x99t be floating, like in space._line_Lockheed says it will experiment with virtual and augmented reality (AR) to help speed up design and construction, and reduce costs, by identifying problem areas before they happen in real life._line_\xe2\x80\x9cFor example,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pratt, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are exploring how we can use AR to integrate exercise equipment for the astronauts\xe2\x80\x94before allocating physical space for it in the habitat. We are also looking at modeling docking ports for other elements of the Deep Space Gateway, rather than cutting holes in the actual Donatello cargo container.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_They\xe2\x80\x99re trying out a variety of platforms for the \xe2\x80\x9cmixed reality\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the project, including Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Hololens and Meta._line_There aren\'t many other details about what the Gateway might look like, but it will of course need life support equipment, protection from deep space radiation, and, for long-term missions, private spaces and exercise areas for astronauts\xe2\x80\x94similar to the International Space Station._line_"Because the Deep Space Gateway would be uninhabited for several months at a time, it has to be rugged, reliable and have the robotic capabilities to operate autonomously,\xe2\x80\x9d Pratt said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cEssentially it is a robotic spacecraft that is well-suited for humans when Orion is present."_line_After Lockheed runs its tests, the company plans to hand over its prototype so that NASA can do its own analyses._line_In addition to the habitat prototype, the company is planning to build an avionics laboratory to demonstrate Deep Space Gateway\xe2\x80\x99s ability to interface with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orion capsule. The module may also help astronauts train for scenarios that might arise in space, should NASA decide to send Lockheed\xe2\x80\x99s design into space._line_Whichever habitat design NASA funds will first set up camp in orbit around the moon in the 2020s, as a testing ground for long-duration missions to Mars in the 2030s._line_'

S"Stevie Nicol's Premier League top 4 predictions_line_The 2017-18 European season is nearly upon us and, with Serie A having finally released its fixture list this week, we have a clear idea of which games to watch and when. Here's a selection of the most intriguing fixture for each weekend in August, leading up until the month-ending international break and transfer window closure._line_Aug. 6: Lille vs. Nantes_line_Ordinarily, there would be nothing special about this run-of-the-mill Ligue 1 fixture. It's not a meeting between two major sides and it's not a local derby, but it does feature a fascinating managerial clash: Marcelo Bielsa vs. Claudio Ranieri, AKA the ideologue vs. the pragmatist._line_Bielsa takes charge of a Lille side that finished an unimpressive 11th last season, but which have made some eye-catching signings. Highly-rated midfielder Thiago Maia is the most intriguing and, together with his compatriots Luiz Araujo, a left-winger, and holding midfielder Thiago Mendes, Lille have splashed close to \xc2\xa330m on three promising Brazilians. They're just three of nine buys with an average age of 22. Bielsa is doing his usual thing: Packing the squad with energetic, hungry players, who can be moulded to suit his philosophy._line_Nantes, meanwhile, were flattered by their seventh-place finish last season; they were an unimaginative, defensive-minded side who scored fewer goals -- 40 -- than third-bottom Lorient. But perhaps Ranieri will be able to transform them into a counter-attacking unit in the manner of his famous Leicester team. Speedy wide forward Prejuce Nakoulma made an impact having arrived midway through last season, although striker Emiliano Sala is very much an old-school target man and will need appropriate service._line_This should be an interesting tactical contest between two wise old managers. Neither are likely to mount a title challenge but, on opening day in Ligue 1, expect Bielsa's side to come flying out of the blocks and Ranieri to set his men up to pick off their hosts._line_Aug. 12: Brighton vs. Manchester City_line_It will be Brighton's first top-flight game since 1983 and an emotional occasion for the home supporters, who have spent much of the past 30 years concerned by where their club will play, never might at what level they would compete. After leaving their old Goldstone Ground in 1997, Brighton shared 50 miles away at Gillingham, then moved to an athletics stadium in their home town before, after years of political wrangling, finally building a purpose-built stadium._line_After several near misses in their bid to be promoted from the Championship, they will savour Premier League football for the first time. Manager Chris Hughton boasts experience at the highest level and is a master of drilling his players in a simple, back-to-basics defensive system. Brighton won't roll over easily and, in French attacking midfielder Anthony Knockaert, have a potential star in their ranks._line_But the major story is the new-look Manchester City. Strengthened with five signings, including an entirely new set of full-backs, Pep Guardiola essentially has no excuse for failure this season. Having tried various new tactical experiments during his first year in charge, it feels like City's manager will revert to a more conventional approach this time around, with overlapping full-backs and a more standard 4-2-3-1 system._line_This feels like a gentle warm-up for City. However, visiting newly-promoted sides can be a tricky task; they're something of an unknown quality, the atmosphere will be excellent and Brighton's players will be determined to prove they belong. The hosts play good football but, on this occasion, a direct approach to exploit City's weaknesses makes sense._line_Aug. 20: Tottenham vs. Chelsea_line_Last season's top two in England on the second weekend of the new campaign. Their league games in 2016/17 were both excellent, with Chelsea earning a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in November, before Tottenham produced arguably the best team performance of the season to convincingly win 2-0 at White Hart Lane just over a month later._line_Then there was a quite extraordinary FA Cup semifinal, which Chelsea won 4-2 at Wembley, which will host this latest clash of London rivals. Tottenham have moved 12 miles west of White Hart Lane for a season at the national stadium and one of the keenest observers of the situation will be Chelsea, who are likely to follow suit with a temporary Wembley arrangement as they redevelop Stamford Bridge._line_The game itself should be great. Mauricio Pochettino's approach against Antonio Conte last season was based around matching Chelsea's 3-4-3; Tottenham play the system with great cohesion and fluidity and the versatility of Eric Dier allows them to switch seamlessly between a three-man defence and a back four._line_Conte's side, meanwhile, will have their first major test as defending champions. Alvaro Morata's performance will be of particular interest and he won't have a tougher challenge than facing the league's best defensive pairing of Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. It could be a steep learning curve for the Spanish striker._line_Aug. 26: Roma vs. Inter_line_The first big game of the Italian season is given extra spice by the fact that Inter's new manager is Luciano Spalletti, who will return to the Stadio Olimpico just weeks after leaving Roma for the second time, having taken the Giallorossi to the highest second-place points tally -- 87 -- in Serie A history._line_His job at Inter is far from simple. The club's recent record is mediocre -- fourth is their best league finish in the last six seasons -- and yet there is always expectation of a title challenge. Spalletti is the most forward-thinking, progressive coach Inter have had for years, however, and transfer business has been quietly encouraging. Borja Valero, signed from Fiorentina, has been one of Serie A's most creative midfielders in recent years, while young centre-back Milan Skriniar was excellent at Sampdoria last season._line_Roma's new boss is Eusebio Di Francesco and he's been forced to cope with several major departures: Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, defender Antonio Rudiger, winger Mohamed Salah and legendary playmaker Francesco Totti have all left. Even if Roma's No. 10 only played a bit-part role last season, it will still be curious to see them begin a campaign without Totti for the first time since 1992-93._line_It would be a surprise if either of these sides won Serie A this season; defending champions Juventus, the increasingly impressive Napoli and a refreshed Milan seem more likely winners. However, with Serie A entitled to four automatic Champions League places, the battle for fourth is now meaningful and it might come down to Roma and Inter._line_"

S'England all-rounder Ben Stokes says he was left devastated by his last over horror show in the World Twenty20 final against West Indies and has yet to watch a re-run of Carlos Brathwaite hitting him for four straight sixes._line_The 24-year-old, who had earned plaudits for his efforts in the last over of England\'s semi-final win over New Zealand, was tasked with bowling the final over on Sunday in Kolkata with the West Indies needing an unlikely 19 from it to win._line_But Brathwaite slugged Stokes\' first four deliveries for giant sixes to give the West Indies their second World Twenty 20 title and leave the Englishman on his haunches looking close to tears._line_"I thought, \'I\'ve just lost the World Cup\'. I couldn\'t believe it," Stokes was quoted as saying by British newspaper The Daily Telegraph on Friday._line_"I didn\'t know what to do. It took me so long to get back on my feet. I didn\'t want to get back up. It was like the whole world had come down on me. There weren\'t any good things going through my mind. It was just complete devastation."_line_Stokes, who had given up just three runs in the final over against New Zealand, said he was still confident of closing out victory against the West Indies even after Brathwaite had clubbed his first two deliveries over the rope._line_"After the first six I thought, \'Oh God\', but I was backing myself. I had been in that type of situation for four weeks in all my training so it was not a case of holding anything back and thinking I hope I get this one in, because I knew I could do it," Stokes said._line_"I haven\'t watched it back yet because I don\'t want to bring myself to do that at this stage so I don\'t know how much I missed it by but as a bowler you have a feeling as soon as you let go whether or not you have got a yorker right and it felt like I had."_line_Stokes was subject to ridicule in his native New Zealand, and two radio presenters were suspended after they broadcast a conversation with his mother on air as she tried to defend her son against the criticism._line_Stokes said despite the experience in the final he would not be shirking the responsibility of bowling at the death again._line_"Some days they go well. Some days they don\'t," he added._line_"That was a bad day but I won\'t be shying away from it. You almost want it to happen because if you nail it everyone forgets (the final)."_line_'

The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch review: iPad Pro 10.5-inch is a new size for the series. Apple might well phase out the smaller 9.7-inch version as this new size gains ground. The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version._line_The iPad has for long been lording over the tablet segment. But now, even as tablet sales across the world have plateaued, Apple wants the iPad to start replacing laptops of creative users. But can a really powerful tablet take on the likes of the MacBook Pro and offer a better option? Well, this is exactly what I set to figure out with the new iPad Pro 10.5-inch which has just hit the markets._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch specifications: 10.5-inch display with 2224 x 1668 resolution at 264 ppi | A10X Fusion 4th chip with 64-bit | 64GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12MP rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, Quad-LED True Tone flash, 4K video recording + 7MP front camera | iOS 11 | Four speaker audio | Wi\xe2\x80\x91Fi (802.11a/\xe2\x80\x8bb/\xe2\x80\x8bg/\xe2\x80\x8bn/\xe2\x80\x8bac); dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) MIMO | Bluetooth 4.2 | Nano-SIM_line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch price in India: Rs 50,400 onwards_line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch design and display review_line_The Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch is a new size for the series. Apple might well phase out the smaller 9.7-inch version as this new size gains ground. The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version. In fact, the overall size is not that different, but the impact on screen size is significant. Still the 10.5-inch form factor is easy to manage and use. The rest of the design remains the same._line_The one visible hardware change the new iPad Pro ushers in is with display quality. While this too is a Retina display like before, this has an unprecedented 120Hz refresh rate. That is something seen only on high-end televisions and never before on any sort of mobile screen. But what does this mean for the user?_line_Well, to start with this is a much better, more natural experience, when it comes to watching high quality videos or playing games. The frames have no lag in between, however high the quality of the graphics in the game. On the productivity front this means the Apple Pencil works more naturally too. The millisecond lag in the earlier version is no longer there and the experience is more like pencil on paper, though I still think the Apple Pencil is more marble than wood for my liking._line_As a side note, I need to add that the Apple iPad Pro is still the gold standard when it comes to audio quality on anything mobile. Pair the stunning screen and speakers together and you have arguably the best mobile video consumption device in the world at the moment._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch performance review _line_The iPad Pro might be a good video consumption device, but Apple seems to be pitching this more as a video creation device. The 64-bit A10X Fusion chip works in tandem with an M10 coprocessor to offer professional grade performance on a one-pound device. At the launch, the company wowed everyone by doing stuff on the iPad Pro that a MacBook Pro wont be able to do all that easily. For average users this means doing everyday tasks without any lag, or editing photos realtime with no wait for the corrected images to render. However, if you want to edit video, or create and add graphics to the same, this is the only tablet in the world that will be able to do it._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5 inch might be a good video consumption device, but Apple seems to be pitching this more as a video creation device._line_While my creativity is limited to text, I did check out with some more creative people on how the iPad Pro improved their productivity and even those using the version of the iPad Pro seemed to think this version was far better. With apps like Procreate you can now do Adobe Photoshop level layered editing on the iPad Pro and the results are visible almost instantaneous, no need to wait for a render. This nimbleness is there even when you edit video or add graphics to it._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch battery review _line_The new iPad Pro has a slightly bigger battery than the 9.5-inch version. But despite the extra bright screen and faster refresh rate, the iPad is able to offer close to a full working day of life on the trot. In fact, I charged the review unit for the first time after a week of random use. Also power efficiency is where the M10 coprocessor does most of its work._line_The new Apple iPad Pro 10.5 inch has a slightly bigger battery than the 9.5-inch version. But despite the extra bright screen and faster refresh rate, the iPad is able to offer close to a full working day of life on the trot._line_In fact the A10x processor is not even called to work for a lot of tasks like notification updates or email syncing and this helps save power. Plus, the display redress rate falls drastically if you are not watching video or playing a game. However, I think Apple should maybe offer a stamina mode where it can offer longer battery life for those who need it._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch accessories_line_The Apple iPad Pro comes with two accessories \xe2\x80\x94 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard \xe2\x80\x94 that add to its productivity. However, both of these have not got a refresh with the new iPad Pro, except for the new size of the Magic Keyboard. However, the experience of using the Apple Pencil has improved significantly thanks to the higher refresh rate of the screen. It now makes better sense to buy the Apple Pencil than a year before. I just hope Apple offers add-ons to the pencil that make it feel more natural. The keyboard is the same, and takes time getting used to. I prefer using a third-party one with more travel than Apple can offer._line_The Apple iPad Pro comes with two accessories \xe2\x80\x94 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard \xe2\x80\x94 that add to its productivity._line_The one accessory that is new is the Apple sleeve, which finally bring in a case to stash away the iPad and a slot to secure the Pencil. Earlier, managing the Pencil was a bit of a pain._line_Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch verdict_line_If you are looking for a tablet that will replace your laptop and still let you stick to high-end resource-heavy creativity, then your quest ends here. There is no other tablet that can do this much and this efficiently, that too without breaking a sweat. But if you just want a tablet to browse and consume video, then look at the more affordable iPads. As the name suggests, this is clearly for the Pros. And on the question, whether the new Apple iPad Pro can replace a laptop, I would now be inclined to say yes. I would be comfortable making this my online mobile device and not the backup._line_'

Luckily in a city like Chicago, there are plenty of places that cater to those tiniest of food critics. Read on to find out where the pros go to score kid-friendly snacks._line_The Sweetest Stack_line_ One food that makes Executive Chef Bryan Allen\xe2\x80\x99s daughter flip is pancakes, particularly the ones at Siena Tavern. The restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s almond pancakes \xe2\x80\x94 served with lemon-cardamom cream and almond butter \xe2\x80\x94 are her current obsession (never mind that dad serves pancakes on his own brunch menu at The Windsor). \xe2\x80\x9cShe always asks for extra almond butter and she loves citrus\xe2\x80\xa6 the lemon cream is her favorite part,\xe2\x80\x9d Allen says. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no problems with helping her finish them \xe2\x80\x94 they are excellent!\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ Mac and Cheese with a Kick_line_ Chef Greg Biggers may spend his days crafting upscale dishes for Caf\xc3\xa9 de Architectes, but when he\xe2\x80\x99s with his son, fancy food is not top of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cMy seven year old has three basic food groups: macaroni and cheese, chicken legs and ice cream,\xe2\x80\x9d Biggers says. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter he found out that Honey Butter Fried Chicken had what he refers to as, \xe2\x80\x98Epic Mac-N-Cheese!!!!\xe2\x80\x99 that became our go-to spot in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d This menu mainstay is a pimento-laced version of mac and cheese, which has proven to be popular with both kids and adults. After the mac, Biggers and his son make a beeline for the Brookfield Zoo to score a sweet favorite. \xe2\x80\x9cLiving out in Brookfield near the Brookfield Zoo, we are also now required to stop by ZOO City Treats to round out his meal with Superman Ice Cream on the way home,\xe2\x80\x9d Biggers says._line_ Hot Diggity Dog!_line_ Between his Logan Square hot spot Giant and his newly opened City Mouse, Jason Vincent is a busy man. He is also a family man (in fact, he named both restaurants after books that his daughters love). When Vincent has time to kick back with his girls, he takes them to a classic Chicago drive-in: Superdawg. \xe2\x80\x9cMy favorite thing to do with the girls is to go to Superdawg and get hot dogs, fries and some shakes and make a picnic in the way back of our station wagon\xe2\x80\xa6 we just sit there and talk and watch the other people,\xe2\x80\x9d Vincent says._line_ Gotta Get That Gelato_line_ Baker Ellen King\xe2\x80\x99s impeccable pastries at Hewn in Evanston, Illinois, have satisfied many a sweet tooth\xe2\x80\xa6 but surprisingly not her son\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cOwning a bakery, you would think your kid would be in heaven eating cookies, croissants, etc.; however, my son does not really like to eat any of the sweets at the bakery,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Instead, he ventures down the street to an Argentinian gelato shop called Frio Gelato. \xe2\x80\x9cThe flavors constantly change and\xe2\x80\xa6 [my son] is willing to try any flavor and venture out of the box, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d The recent favorite of this 10-year-old gelato aficionado?

Her series of works entitled Imprint, are presently on display at the Icon Art Gallery in the city.

S"When agencies begin working with new clients, first impressions mean everything. Onboarding is one of the initial interactions between a company and its newly won client. It's no surprise, then, that the company's approach affects the client-agency relationship from the very beginning and can have lasting effects moving forward._line_Here are five simple suggestions to ease the onboarding process._line_1. Keep communications open._line_Solving pain points early on is the quickest way to ease the stress of a new client (or a new employee, for that matter). Agencies first must listen well to clients to figure out the main goal. Perhaps this goes without saying, but the client also must listen well to the agency. _line_Open communications across both parties can foster a positive consultant/client structure. The first week working together creates the most impressions and lays the foundation for productive (or not) relationships between the groups._line_2. Make certain the data is accurate. _line_To help clients optimize their business processes, it's important to analyze forward-facing information as well as the data they collect and bring to work sessions. Sometimes the data on a client\xe2\x80\x99s website differs from the client's story._line_For example, if a client is losing money and needs to figure out why, it's smart to assess business information along with marketing campaigns. Either can help drive more positive traffic toward the client. But inaccurate numbers can lead to faulty information on websites and across collateral materials. Consultants must look behind the messaging to dig into the figures, too. _line_3. Write the real story -- with the real numbers._line_No doubt the client has researched the agency before seeking an outside professional's opinion. In fact, the client might know more about the agency than the agency has anticipated. This actually is a positive sign that the client appreciates the consultant company's culture and philosophy._line_Once data is compiled, vetted and analyzed, the agency can write a real story that aligns with the client's vision. Numbers can say much about a company, but a story can flesh out even more details._line_4. Devise a strategy to solve pain points._line_Entrepreneurs are famous for identifying and solving pain points before they become chronic issues. Larger companies would be wise to develop this attribute. Smaller agencies tend to have a lower client-to-manager ratio, with greater individual knowledge of clients and more personal connections. This naturally provides ample opportunities to address emerging concerns before conflicts arise._line_Solving pain points the client hadn't truly felt yet elevates the consultant's value and increases the likelihood the client will remain with the agency across a longer time span. _line_5. Bring it all together._line_The previous four techniques uncovered options. Now, it's time to discuss how each can best be optimized to achieve the client's objectives. Consultants can break down what they've learned about the client to create innovative ways of dealing with pain points when they're mere discomforts. This way, the agency develops a process for anticipating issues that may make the client uncomfortable -- and then further proves its worth by handling those aspects before the client has time to feel the sting._line_Next Article_line_5 Ways to Optimize Your Ecommerce Campaigns_line_Rocco Baldassarre_line_"

S' New Delhi, July 30 (IANS) Gaurav Gupta\'s couture collection that took references from the "sculptures found in the realm of a mythological forest", looked even more dreamy when actress Aditi Rao Hydari closed the designer\'s show at the ongoing India Couture Week (ICW) here. _line_ Couture mostly means bridal in India, but the definition of bridal wear has changed, and Gupta just proved that by showcasing his latest collection, "Moondust", at ICW on Saturday._line_ "This collection is extremely couture. It\'s inspired by nature, forest, almost like a parallel world which is happening on the moon in a fairytale way._line_ "It is all these art like scuptures made into garments which are wearable sculptures. It\'s just about celebrating fantasy," Gupta told reporters here after the show that saw the designer collaborating with luxury boutique studio Klove to bring to life an immersive installation._line_ "We got mesh from Italy. We developed laces from scratch. That\'s what makes this collection haute couture," he added._line_ He believes India has couture "thriving". "India is one of the places in whole world which consumes couture. It\'s only been consumed in India or the middle east."_line_ Using his signature fabrics like chiffon, crepe, tulle, net and lace, the collection had pieces with exaggerated shoulders, fishtail gowns, body hugging dresses and much more in colours like grey, blue and green._line_ "Many of my brides wear gowns on their special events, or go for an amalgamation of a gown with something Indian. There are new silhouettes, colours and a lot of experimentation within that," he told IANS._line_ "Today the brides only wear bridal on their wedding day, for the rest of the days it is new global couture for them," he added._line_ And like the evolution of couture, his showstopper Aditi also likes to "evolve"._line_ "She is not scared to experiment. Within that (what she wears) she finds her personality. She\'s a thinking wearer," Gupta said about the actress, who sported side swept hairstyle and wore a grey gown with a long trail._line_ "It\'s very special because GG (Gupta) is one of the first people who encouraged me when I was new ...almost six to seven years ago," she said on closing his show._line_ Recalling her initial days in showbiz, she said: "He called me and I went to his studio. I just sat there for the whole day. I took out everything from all his old and new collections. I tried everything on. I felt like a real princess."_line_ "From that day to this day, I am so close to him. He is very protective of me. It\'s very special because its the first time I am walking for him. And also the collection is called \'Moondust\'," she said._line_ And like Gupta, Aditi believes in enchanted forests, unicorns, reindeers and all happy things._line_ One could see all the "enchantment" on her garment._line_ The day was special for Aditi for one more reason. The poster of her upcoming film "Bhoomi", which is comeback film of actor Sanjay Dutt, was unveiled on Saturday._line_ "It\'s special. That is Sanju sir\'s comeback film. I feel lucky to be working with him. There\'s a lot more to come," promised the petite actress, who couldn\'t stop looking at the tall models who walked with her during the show._line_ Intimidated by them?_line_ "Always. They are so tall, I call them giraffe. They are very sweet to me. Whenever I\'ve walked on the ramp, I\'ve got such a lovely energy from everybody."_line_ --IANS_line_ nn/sku/ _line_'

S"When the going gets tough, the mentally strong kick butt and take names._line_Between trying to succeed in your career goals and trying to find some kind of personal balance, life can be pretty hectic. And when the going gets tough, it's easy to consider giving up or dropping back. If this is you, it's time to take a cue from the mentally strong._line_Here are some common traits mentally strong people share:_line_Never give up._line_Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone will fail at something at some time in their lives. Look at failure as a chance to improve at what you do. Failure, not success, is what makes people learn and grow, and be willing to fail again and again in order to soak up as much knowledge as possible._line_Enjoy your own company._line_Mentally strong people aren't afraid to be alone, and don't flip out every time they don't have plans or have an opening in their calendars. Instead, they enjoy and even treasure the time they spend alone and use it as downtime to reflect, to plan, and to be productive. Be your own biggest fan and believe that you are in good company, and can be just as happy alone as with others._line_Don't feel entitled--know that you have to work for everything you have_line_The mentally strong don't feel that they world owes them. Know that hard work begets success, and be willing to put in the time and effort to get there._line_Know that all good things take time._line_Be patient and remember that nothing good happens overnight. Therefore, be patient and in it for the long haul. When the going gets tough, dig in and work harder to apply your energy and time and celebrate each milestone when you can._line_Roll with the punches._line_While the rest of the population is stressed bad traffic, silly people and a late flight, the mentally strong know that these factors are generally beyond their control. The only thing you can control is your own response and attitude. How will you choose to react?_line_Accept that you can't please everyone._line_Strive to be kind, fair, and to please others where it's appropriate, but know your own rights too! Be unafraid to speak up and do what's right, even if others don't like it. You should be strong enough to withstand the possibility that someone will get upset, but take your confidence from the fact that you are doing what you believe is morally right._line_Take calculated risks._line_Calculated risks are okay for strong people. Do your research, weigh the pros and cons of taking the risks, and envision what the outcome will be before proceeding. Be prepared to accept and deal with the consequences, whatever they might be._line_Don't live in the past--look towards the future._line_There is no good that can come of reliving a decision you have made over and over again. Strong people know that if they want something to change, they focus on the future, and what can be done. So, accept any lesson that was gained from that past decision and move on with your life._line_Learn from your mistakes._line_... and from others' mistakes, because life is too short to make them all by yourself. A mentally strong person accepts full responsibility for past behavior and is willing to learn from their mistakes. Analyze what you could have done differently and make sure to act accordingly the next time._line_Don't be jealous of others._line_There's no point in being jealous or resentful of other people's successes, know that others have worked hard for what they have. You should feel happy when other people find their own successes and their own way in their lives._line_It takes strength of character to be excited for other people. If anything, other people's successes just makes you work harder, and soon you can experience something that they can be proud of too._line_Quit feeling sorry for yourself._line_There's no time to waste! Self-pity is a waste of energy. Instead, take responsibility for your actions and outcomes, and know that life can be unfair. Taking action is a much better use of your time._line_Stop letting others make you feel bad._line_If someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself, understand that they can only do that if you give them the power to do so. Avoid giving others the power to make you feel inferior. Remember, you are in control of your actions and emotions!_line_Don't be afraid of change._line_In fact, you should embrace change and welcome challenge. Try not to become stagnant in your life. Can you think of someone in your life that you consider to be strong willed? Take a few notes from them and remember that an environment of change and sometimes uncertainty can energize you!_line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_"

S'India thrash Sri Lanka by 304 runs to post their biggest win overseas and take a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series_line_India captain Virat Kohli grins after Umesh Yadav dismisses Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Dhanushka Gunatilaka for 2 on Day Four at Galle. AP_line_It was India\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Test win abroad. Yet, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like one. No one scampered to pluck the souvenir stumps, it was an afterthought. No one swooped on Mohammed Shami, whose catch ended Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s fitful resistance. No one squealed or scowled, let alone burst into a delirious high-fives. The Indians celebrating their 304-run win and their 1-0 lead in the series resembled a bunch of orderly convent boys out on an excursion._line_It was in sync with how the match had meandered on after Shikhar Dhawan\xe2\x80\x99s breathtaking hundred. Not that the match crawled thereafter \xe2\x80\x93 both sides still batted at brisk pace and Virat Kohli scripted his 17th hundred \xe2\x80\x93 but it was considerably less thrilling, devoid of the customary ebbs and flows of Test matches in Galle. The fact that this was the weakest of Sri Lankan sides in the last two decades, further defected by unfortunate injuries to their batting tyro and their skipper, too needs at least a mention here._line_It was also a sign of how the team has metamorphosed into a ruthless winning machine, at least in the subcontinent. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason such canters didn\xe2\x80\x99t excite them any longer. The most definitive aspect of this win is that it was made to look routine. Even making things appear ho-hum is an art, and indicates how India has come up in leaps, since the last time they departed this idyllic port town._line_This is a team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blink in adversity, they have a man who puts up his hand for every occasion. The biggest difference, Kohli sees is how the team has begun to execute their plans methodically. The roles are defined and executed with a cutting-edge precision._line_\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, it was more of talking a lot about plans and planning a lot about how to go a certain way against a certain player. Now I think guys are very comfortable with their skills and how they have to bowl and where they have to bowl and what fields they want. Also, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said._line_No longer naive_line_To put it other words, they are no longer naive or dependent. If the Sri Lankans had applied fastidiously enough, they could have defied India to at least the end of fourth day. Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja embodied that meticulous execution of plans Kohli was raving about. The build-up to Sri Lankan opener Upul Tharanga\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal by Sami was a classic case. He gave him a classical working over. He began the over with the one that angled away from him around the stumps._line_He opens the bat phase for squeezing a boundary. The next is angled delivery straying into the pads. The next was the sucker ball-slanting in, a touch fuller, cajoling the batsman for the drive, then seaming away at the last moment, thus inducing the edge. It was a pity that Kohli spilled the catch. But Shami knew he had his man\xe2\x80\x99s number. Two balls later, he angled one in outside the off-stump, before making it cackle back a shade to brush his inside edge. Tharanga sized up the angle, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t account for the seam movement._line_Jadeja\xe2\x80\x99s deception was softer. Unlike Ravichandran Ashwin who took time to get a measure of the wicket, Jadeja had the wisdom to mix up the lengths. He would continuously bowl briskly at the stumps, before sowing the doubts with a slower, more flighted delivery that spat a little away. It was the continuous pressure he exerted on Niroshan Dickwella that prompted him to attempt a fatal sweep off Ashwin, which broke Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s last lingering hopes of stretching the match, and perhaps accomplishing a miraculous jailbreak._line_Their purposeful batting would have, at least momentarily, concerned Kohli. For he has seen unseemly pairs taking the game away from India, like Roston Chase and Shane Dowrich in Kington, or Peter Handscomb and Shaun Marsh in Ranchi. But for a team progressively on the upward curve, they ensured such defiance don\xe2\x80\x99t recur. Maybe, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t show much emotions, but inwardly they have must have been relieved that the spooky ghosts of the past have been laid to rest._line_'

S' Indian cricket has always been embracing quandaries in their cricketing expeditions, from coach selection to team selection this side has been cruising through a seesaw ride these days. The entire matter expands its wings when the slew of cricketers make their way to the dugout hoping to unleash their onslaught in the imminent chance given but matters drown deeper when all players in the eleven in order to establish their position in the team ended up giving their best shot in the middle. Something similar to this has yet been unfolded inside the Indian dugout as Dinesh Karthik and his counting of days for another opportunity to play wearing India\xe2\x80\x99s jersey is still in motion._line_Hindustan Times_line_Karthik already displayed a rich vein of form in 50-over cricket for Tamil Nadu which culminated in two title wins for the state \xe2\x80\x93 Vijay Hazare Trophy and Deodhar Trophy where Karthik recorded centuries in either final. Indian ODI team especially the middle order seems to be fully packed up with big names like Yuvraj Singh, Ravinder Jadeja, MS Dhoni and also Hardik Pandya along with Kedar Jadhav has been the matter of dilemma for Karthik\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the eleven. A possible return of Karthik to Indian team can be seen through an additional wicket keeper as he was placed in the Champions trophy squad._line_NDTV Sports_line_This ray of hope, unfortunately, ignited his craving fire a little as during Champions trophy we all have witnessed how he had been put to rest for the entire Championship stint even after scoring an unbeaten 94 in the 2nd practice match before the official tour scratching the surface. Yaa! his slump in batting potential could be the reason for such ignorance but after displaying his reliable batting strength along with the skipper Kohli during the practice match was indeed the worth of a call to the eleven. Karthik has a sound technique and is more than capable of playing big shots at the end. He also has the experience to step into the shoes of Yuvraj at No. 4._line_Also in lieu of Dhoni, 32-year-old could be a lucrative option for Indian perspective specifically as an extra wicket keeper option. As we all have witness hitherto that Dhoni\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught has been waning these days hence in such circumstances Karthik could be cropped up to the business. And also he himself seemed confident of earning Kohli\xe2\x80\x99s attention regarding his comeback to the team so it is thought to be imminent that we will witness Karthik playing for Indian cricket team very soon as he is an absolute player for all formats so his contribution in the team could result in a triumphant manner._line_'

S'Mouse pups derived from sperm that was freeze-dried and stored on the International Space Station for nine months._line_ Mouse sperm preserved on the International Space Station for nine months gave rise to healthy pups, a new study reveals._line_ This finding suggests that animals, perhaps including humans, can one day reproduce safely in space, researchers said._line_ This work also raises the possibility of a "doomsday vault" for sperm in space that could help preserve animal species from disasters on Earth, much as the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, does for plant species. The sperm-vault idea is similar to one depicted in a novel by the author of "A Game of Thrones," scientists added. [The Human Body in Space: 6 Weird Facts]_line_ If humans ever want to live permanently in space, they will need to make sure they and any farm animals they bring with them can reproduce, said study senior author Teruhiko Wakayama, a reproductive biologist at the University of Yamanashi in Kofu, Japan, and his colleagues._line_ However, outer space is dangerous. For instance, the average daily radiation dose on the International Space Station (ISS) is more than 100 times higher than that on Earth, and could damage the sperm and eggs that give rise to most animal offspring, the researchers said._line_ To examine the damage that space radiation could do to potential animal offspring, the researchers shipped samples of freeze-dried mouse sperm into space. (Freeze-drying preserves items by rapidly freezing them and then subjecting them to a high vacuum that dehydrates them. Freeze-dried ice cream is often known as "astronaut ice cream.")_line_ This mouse sperm was stored on the ISS for 288 days, from August 2013 to May 2014, at temperatures of minus 139 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 95 degrees Celsius). The sperm was then returned to Earth and compared with freeze-dried samples that were preserved on Earth during the same time under similar conditions._line_ The researchers found evidence that space-preserved sperm did experience slightly more DNA damage than Earth-preserved samples._line_ "This was a little bit surprising, because the storage period was only nine months," Wakayama told Space.com._line_ The scientists then employed in vitro fertilization techniques, using both the space- and Earth-preserved sperm to produce embryos that were transferred into female mice. The average birth rates from the two kinds of samples were comparable, and the ratio of male to female in the two kinds of pups fell within the normal range, the researchers said. Furthermore, analyses of the pups\' genomes revealed only minor differences between the two types of mice, and the pups from space-preserved sperm went on to develop into adults with normal fertility._line_ All in all, the researchers said their findings suggest that the DNA damage seen in the space-preserved sperm got largely repaired in the embryos after fertilization. Previous research done over nearly 40 years has found that egg cells have a strong potential for repairing damaged DNA, the scientists explained._line_ These findings suggest that healthy animal offspring could be produced using sperm preserved in space and artificial insemination techniques, the researchers said. Many domesticated animals are already produced using artificial insemination. _line_ "If humans live in space for a very long time, then we will want to eat beefsteak," Wakayama said._line_ The scientists noted that freeze-dried sperm can be preserved at room temperature for up to two years, and in a freezer almost indefinitely. This raises the possibility that a sperm bank in space could help protect animal species from catastrophes on Earth, the researchers said. Wakayama cited a similar idea that was brought up in the science-fiction book "Tuf Voyaging" by George R.R. Martin, the author of "A Game of Thrones."_line_ For example, the spaces within lava tubes on the moon are cold, protected from space radiation by thick bedrock and isolated from Earth. "Therefore, sperm could be preserved forever" on the moon, Wakayama said. Still, he added that this notion "is too preliminary to say it is a good idea or it is possible."_line_ The scientists detailed their findings online today (May 22) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences._line_'

S'  By: Pallavi Aman Singh _line_ New Delhi [India], Jul 29 (ANI): Once considered a  behind-closed-doors affair, the powerful, emotional and beautiful  journey of birth has now turned into an up-and-coming niche as capturing this highest form of expression can be quite an art in itself._line_ The days of dads-to-be being confined to the waiting rooms may have been long gone, but partners with an iPhone don\'t necessarily click the best shots with those  shaky hands. Here\'s when a birth photographer comes into the picture, leaving new parents free to live in the moment._line_ Usually seen as just taking pictures of the emerging baby, birth photography has more to it. It is about capturing the raw and real emotions of the event and un-photoshopped moment as it unfolds - be it a mother\'s strained, gasping face or her bulging neck veins._line_ Blurring the lines between public and private domains, this latest trend is turning a traditionally hush-hush event into something to be captured on camera and shared with a wider audience._line_ "Birth photography is a concept that revolves around capturing the miracle of childbirth in its most gracious form," professional photographer  Urshita Saini, founder of InfLens, told ANI. "People talk about birth being a miracle; all I do is describe it in the form of pictures."_line_ "Be it the bond that a husband and a wife share during labour, the first time the baby steps into the world, its first expressions, its crying, its laughter, mother and baby\'s first look at each other, the father\'s expressions when he sees the baby for the first time, the family\'s bond after coming of the new member, I capture it all," she added._line_ Already a trend in the West, birth photography is gradually gaining popularity in India with parents choosing to show the beauty in birth instead of waiting to photograph a perfectly posed newborn at a studio._line_ Talking on the same, Urshita said, "People here, once made aware of the concept and the sanctity of the pictures, get interested in the concept."_line_ "At times it does happen that people opt out after being interested mainly because they do not see this as a common activity online. I call this the \'fear of the unknown.\' But we are trying to connect with more and more people and make them aware, through multiple channels and we have been getting a great response," she continued._line_ In a country like India, where there are a lot of superstitions around photographing a newborn and a pregnant woman, how far can a concept like this reach? "Yes there are superstitions; not showing the baby to anyone outside the family for 40 days, not clicking the pictures for the first 3 months, etc, but this is restricted to only certain people," Urshita answered._line_ "And we have realized that this prejudice is not dependent on the strata that the family belongs to. It completely depends on the mindset and exposure to the family. But I am sure even this group of people will catch up once they see the world around them enjoying these memories," she added._line_ Sure, birth-photography may be a challenging affair in India as too many taboos exist around it, but the photogs find the experience equally satisfying._line_ "Well honestly, I am sure I face the same challenges and benefits that any other photographer outside India faces," Urshita said, noting, "Everybody gets rejections; everybody has to have the patience and the strong willpower needed to withstand the time and toil of capturing the birth of a child. But yes, I do get importance and recognition for my profession, and I also get applauded for my persistence to spread this concept in India."_line_ "I have carried out more than 30 birth shoots. During my first shoot, there were a lot of circumstances that I did not foresee that made me realize how birth photography needs me to be extremely strong mentally. So yes, in short, the first birth shoot was one of a kind experience for me," she added._line_ Moreover, this profession of providing new parents with incredible memories in the form of pictures so that they can relive the whole experience over and over again comes with some unique challenges._line_ "Dealing with the superstitions is a big challenge that currently limits our audience," she noted, adding, "In the  operation theatres (OT), we need to ensure that both the photographer and the equipment are sterile."_line_ "On the photography front, taking photographs in low light and being quick on your feet to ensure that you don\'t miss a single moment are important factors that define the quality of pictures," Urshita continued._line_ For the photographers, the obstacles don\'t end here. "Initially, it will be challenging as people are not aware of the concept and are not sure what kind of photographs will be clicked. There are chances that parents might shun off the concept considering the fear of any health complication of the baby, the privacy of the family or the  superstitions," Urshita explained._line_ "However, with time the photographer will learn the trick of persuading the parents and ensuring them of proper health and privacy of the family. Once the photographer is able to learn on this persuading expertise, nothing can stop him/her from rising up with this trend," she said._line_ Captured mostly in portrait mode, this genre of photography is all about taking shots during the labour hours till the baby is out of the mother\'s womb and it takes a lot of effort to get that perfect click._line_ "There is a need to understand that as a photographer, one should be able to carry his/her work unnoticed. It\'s necessary to ensure that the doctor or any of the medical staff and especially the mother is not being disturbed during the birthing process," she said._line_ She further said, "Unsatisfied customers are a result of demands not met properly or some confusion that pertained even after shoots. Thankfully, no such thing happened with me yet. But, we at  InfLens, make sure that parents are completely made aware of the concept, and the photo shoot is done in accordance with their demands in best possible way."_line_ So, how does birth photography differ from images taken immediately after birth? "Babies change very quickly in the initial first hour of their birth. It takes at least 20 minutes for the baby to come out of the labour room/ OT. Till the time the baby comes out of the OT, it would have changed; its face less swollen, feet stretched out, the crooked nose would be back in shape, etc," Urshita replied._line_ "Furthermore, inside the OT, one can capture the expression of the mother once she sees her baby for the very first time. Moreover, the \'First Moments\' of the baby are inside the labour room/ OT. So it becomes imperative for the Photographer to be present there for locking these precious moments," she continued._line_ Can someone make his/her living solely documenting childbirth? "No. As of now in India, this is not something that can help you sustain a livelihood. Unlike, weddings or birthdays, this is one genre that people are not aware of, and hence the photographer might land up with very few shoots," Urshita said. "But this is what I and my partner, Sahil is out to change. We are aiming at promoting and educating people about this concept and the importance of preserving these memories, as much as we can."_line_ Be it photoshopping sonograms onto pregnant bellies or clicking a newborn attached to placenta, babies have become the new favourite for photographers and are ruling our lives, the Internet._line_ According to Urshita, "It is a novel idea of getting photographs clicked with a photoshopped sonogram of the baby on the naked belly. And, I feel it relates pretty well to my genre of birth photography as it can be well used to portray a \'before\' and \'after\' scenario."_line_ Those who are still trying to get around the idea of having a complete stranger documenting a very private moment, MRI birth videos could be your next best option in the future._line_ Talking about whether or not MRI birth videos can give birth photographers a run for money, she said, "No. MRI birth videos can be a part of the process of capturing the birth of the baby. But, birth photography majorly happens just after the baby enters the world. The expressions and the reactions of the parents, as well as the baby, are in focus. Moreover, MRI videos are a representation of how the baby was born while the birth photographers capture what happens before and after the birth of the baby."_line_ Mastering this art isn\'t that easy and so Urshita listed down some points that could help the budding lensmen._line_ She noted, "Birth photography is one genre that is very different from any other kind of photography for a very simple reason, i.e., you cannot predict your shots. You have to be prepared for the unexpected all the time. Yes, photography is the first step to being successful at this concept since you need to know what instrument will best suit your environment; you need to work in low light, etc. Because flashes are a strict no no."_line_ - Have immense patience._line_ - Look for any and every movement inside the Labour room/ OT._line_ - Focus on the expressions of the mother, the macro shots of the baby and its features._line_ - Try to capture as many expressions of the baby and the parents as you can._line_ "Keep in mind that you are there to photograph the process and not for interfering or obstructing it. If one ever forgets this rule and interferes in the medical procedure, one\'s career gets finished then and there only. Make sure your presence in the labor room/OT is not disturbing the doctor, any of the medical staff and most importantly the mother," she added. "Patience is the biggest virtue that one needs to succeed at. Also one needs to understand that every birth is unique and none of the things happening there can ever be in one\'s control. There\'s a need to be quick with the work and ensure that no disturbance is caused to anybody in the OT."_line_ Urshita concluded, "Birth photography is a new concept in India. But we are pretty sure that it would pick up and soon more people would be interested in getting it done to preserve the first moments of their baby in this world. These are memories that parents, as well as the baby when it grows up, would cherish for a lifetime." (ANI)_line_'

S'India have aced the \'boring\' processes_line_India have now developed their own style of winning Tests. If West Indies\' wins in the 80s were stamped with flamboyance, and Australia\'s at the start of the century underlined ruthlessness and all-round strength, India\'s wins seem to stem from playing to their script, over and over again till it becomes boring. _line_If one had to write a guide on how to win Test matches, especially in the sub-continent, the current India set up would be the perfect author. They\'ve found the perfect marriage of old-school Test cricket with the best of the contemporary. It has the explosiveness and the slow grind in equal measure. It has very little of the unpredictable and more of the routine. The term often used for the process to getting there, by the team itself is \'boring\'._line_India is far from being a boring team, of course. They have some of the most established players, and have mixed it well with ones who are earmarked to take it forward. They vaunt of some of the most exciting cricketers in the world. And the cricket is as ruthless as can be. But all this has been because they have found the \'boring\' route to making it right._line_Batting big in the first innings is spoken off with the utmost importance in Test cricket, and India have made a habit out of it. In the last year, they had scores in excess of 400, in their first innings, 11 times. And they have a great mixture of players who can help them \'bat big\'. Murali Vijay is the classical Test opener, and is a perfect ally to the attacking KL Rahul. The current back-up pair of Abhinav Mukund and Shikhar Dhawan has the exact traits, too. In Pujara, they have a number three who plays every innings like his life depended on it - a very useful characteristic to have for a player who might have to walk in to bat after the wicket of an opener. Virat Kohli is pure magic on his day, while Ajinkya Rahane is able to alternate between playing the attacking innings or stemming the rot as needed. Then they have their slew of allrounders who are capable of piling on more misery or putting a plug to the one they are in._line_Against Sri Lanka in Galle, the way they went about their innings was true to script. Dhawan attacked early and flattened the opposition. Mukund failed, but Pujara gained from Dhawan\'s aggression and in the shadows, notched up another hundred. Kohli failed, but Rahane cashed in. And the lower order attacked to get India to 600 runs. In the second innings, Dhawan and Pujara failed, but the players who had not done well in the first, came to the party. Kohli slammed his 17th Test hundred, while Mukund made a career-best 81._line_Then with the ball, they again stuck to a boring script. There was no need for them to go out of the box at all, even when things weren\'t really going their way. Their pace bowlers made all the early noise, taking wickets to breach the fort early in the innings, and then the spinners took over. When the wickets didn\'t fall, they stayed patient and dried up the runs. There was no panicking, no drop in intensity, no change whatsoever. India had their plans to work on, and had the runs to play with. Twice in the innings, the tide turned, somewhat, and Sri Lanka eked out a fightback, but India were able to nip it in the bud. Again, when the spinners couldn\'t wipe the tail out, Hardik Pandya was able to._line_In the second innings, it was another repeat. Shami and Umesh dented the Sri Lankans early with a wicket each, and put India right on top. Then the spinners took over. Even as Dimuth Karunaratne, first with Kusal Mendis and then with Niroshan Dickwella, defied them, India knew they had no reason to worry unduly. As a watcher from the outside, it was almost as if India had sucked out the drama out of the game. They waited for the breakthrough, and once they got it, finished their job with minimum fuss._line_"We had to work hard for getting all the wickets that we did. I think the bowlers came up with different plans, persisted with long enough to get those breakthroughs and that\'s something that always helps at the beginning of a series to get a victory on a surface which is not offering much and that really gives the team the confidence of doing it once more if we get a surface like that," Kohli said after the match._line_It\'s his preferred way of winning things, and that has come from the team understanding what works best for themselves._line_"Now I think guys are very comfortable with their skills and how they have to bowl and where they have to bowl and what fields they want. That I think is the biggest change that I see (from Galle 2015). They are more confident in their own abilities because of having performed consistently in the last two years. Plus, they know what they have to do on the pitch to get people out now which is the most important factor._line_"Especially in Test matches, if you are not getting wickets, then how to contain runs or how to create opportunities to get wickets. Even batsmen have become smarter now. You don\'t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand, they prepare themselves really well, so guys have become more professional in the last two years and they understand how Test matches are won. That understanding of the game is something that has come along a long way in the last three years."_line_With that kind of belief and understanding, it is tough for a team to slither into panic. As long as they do the \'boring\' part right, India will be impossible to beat._line_There was no need for any intimidation. For a novel field. For a breathtaking catch. Or for a folly. India\'s process would eventually work. And in Galle it showed. The win may have been unremarkable, but it was only because India carve their wins that way now._line_'

S' With its premiere on July 30, we\'re just a couple of days away from finally seeing the new Top Gear America. But you won\'t have to wait that long to get a quick taste of the show on BBC America. We have a clip to share with you, and it\'s of actor and now Top Gear America host William Fichtner driving a Ford F-150 Raptor in the desert. This is an exclusive clip you\'ll only see on Autoblog._line_ He seems to like the truck, saying it\'s "the American dream incarnate," and "a fighter jet on four wheels." It does look about as majestic as a bald eagle out in its natural habitat. While plenty of that is because of the inherent coolness of the truck, part of it is probably due to the way the truck is filmed. It appears that Top Gear America will have a high level of production value, with beautifully framed shots and lighting._line_ When the full episode airs on Sunday, Fichtner, the man behind Finding Steve McQueen, will be joined by two other hosts, Antron Brown and Tom "Wookie" Ford. Brown is a drag racer who first raced motorcycles before taking on Top Fuel drag cars in 2008. He took home his first Top Fuel championship in 2012. Ford has been in the automotive journalism biz for quite a while. He\'s presently an associate editor for Top Gear magazine and was previously at CAR magazine. He also has worked on a number of automotive-related TV shows, including gone, but not forgotten, Fifth Gear._line_'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): Friday\'s landmark verdict by Pakistan\'s Supreme Court to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from holding office and finding him guilty for accumulating assets beyond his known sources of income, may have a resounding impact on that country\'s political landscape, but by no stretch of imagination, can we expect Pakistan\'s foreign or defence policy towards India undergoing any change._line_No change either should be expected whatsoever in the status or standing of the Pakistan Army or its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency vis-a-vis policy towards India._line_As such, the quad erat demonstrandum can only be expected to be business as usual.

S'Donald Trump talks on law enforcement at Suffolk Community College in New York (AFP)_line_ During a speech on Long Island on Friday, President Donald Trump took a break from discussing gang violence and illegal immigration to give the law enforcement officers gathered for his remarks some advice on how to treat suspects._line_"When you guys put somebody in the car and you\'re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?" Trump said, miming the physical motion of an officer shielding a suspect\'s head to keep it from bumping against the squad car._line_ "Like, don\'t hit their head, and they just killed somebody - don\'t hit their head," Trump continued. "I said, you can take the hand away, OK?"_line_ These remarks, coming after Trump talked about towns ravaged by gang violence and described "these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon," met with applause from at least some of the law enforcement officers gathered for his speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York._line_ A group of uniform officers standing behind Trump applauded, and, when he turned to face them, some smiled and appeared to chuckle._line_ In response to a question regarding Trump\'s comments and the officers who applauded, the Suffolk County police quickly distanced the department from Trump\'s comments, saying Friday that they would not accept this treatment of people in custody. _line_ "The Suffolk County Police Department has strict rules and procedures relating to the handling of prisoners, and violations of those rules and procedures are treated extremely seriously," the department said in an emailed statement. "As a department, we do not and will not tolerate \'rough[ing]\' up prisoners."_line_ Trump\'s remarks also drew a rebuke from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a statement, the group did not specifically mention Trump by name but appeared to respond to his speech by stressing the importance of treating all people, including suspects, with respect._line_ "Managing use of force is one of the most difficult challenges faced by law enforcement agencies," the group said. "The ability of law enforcement officers to enforce the law, protect the public, and guard their own safety, the safety of innocent bystanders, and even those suspected or apprehended for criminal activity is very challenging._line_ "For these reasons, law enforcement agencies develop policies and procedures, as well as conduct extensive training, to ensure that any use of force is carefully applied and objectively reasonable considering the situation confronted by the officers," the statement continued._line_ Trump\'s comments were made during a dark, foreboding address largely focusing on the transnational gang MS-13. He also peppered his speech with expressions of support for police, echoing his efforts both during and since the presidential campaign to portray himself as a champion of law enforcement._line_ These remarks were condemned by civil rights and advocacy groups. Vanita Gupta, who ran the Justice Department\'s civil rights division during the Obama administration, decried the comments and said they ran counter to efforts from local police agencies to repair relationships with their communities._line_ "Trump\'s remarks today are unconscionable," Gupta, who is now president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. "The President of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence. His remarks undermine the positive efforts of local law enforcement agencies and communities around the country working to address police misconduct and build community-police trust."_line_ Janai Nelson, the associate director-counsel NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Trump\'s comments "encouraging police officers to disregard the safety of individuals in their custody rises to a new level of danger."_line_ "We need law enforcement who do not share the Trump Administration\'s outdated and unlawful views to promote protecting the rights and safety of all Americans by condemning those who condone impunity among law enforcement," Nelson said in a statement._line_ The American Civil Liberties Union posted on Twitter that Trump was "urging lawlessness" with his speech._line_ Trump has previously encouraged violent behavior during public remarks, particularly during his raucous presidential campaign rallies. At a November 2015 rally in Alabama, Trump said that a protester was loud and "maybe he should have been roughed up."_line_ During another campaign rally in Michigan, Trump said he would defend in court anyone who hurt a protester being escorted out. When a protester interrupted a Las Vegas rally, Trump said "guys like that" used to be "carried out in a stretcher," adding: "I\'d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya." At another rally, Trump said protesters were being removed too slowly because "nobody wants to hurt each other anymore."_line_ With his comments Friday, Trump appeared to encourage police officers not to worry about using excessive force during arrests._line_ Officers can be arrested and charged with excessive force, facing charges on both a local and federal level. Several Suffolk County police officers were indicted last year and accused of beating a suspect after he was arrested in 2012. In November, a week before Trump was elected, the former Suffolk County police chief was sentenced to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to a federal civil rights violation and conspiring to obstruct justice; authorities said he beat a man handcuffed and in police custody._line_ The Justice Department said its investigations of unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement officers most frequently involve allegations of excessive force. If a person alleging excessive force has been arrested or detained, federal officials must prove that an officer used more force "than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim," the Justice Department states._line_ In 2016, a former Las Vegas police officer was charged with violating the civil rights of an unnamed person by using excessive force during an arrest; the indictment specifically notes that among other things, the officer slammed the person\'s head into the door of his police car._line_ Such charges have continued during the Trump administration. Last month, the Justice Department announced that three current and former Florida police officers had been indicted in connection with the assault of a car passenger during a traffic stop. Officers charged with using excessive force during arrests have also faced charges of making false statements about what unfolded._line_ Excessive force lawsuits can also be costly for local governments. Last month, a $225,000 settlement was reached in the case of a Pennsylvania man who said he was shocked with a Taser after arguing with an officer during his arrest. In 2015, a $1 million settlement was reached in a case involving a California sheriff\'s deputy accused of using excessive force on a man with Down syndrome._line_ Trump and his administration have offered a defense of law enforcement officers in the face of what they have portrayed as an anti-police mentality. Attorney General Jeff Sessions tied a recent increase in violent crime to "undermined" respect for police._line_ Sessions\'s Justice Department has also launched a review of all police-reform agreements in place nationwide, pacts that remain a key legacy of former president Barack Obama\'s administration. Such agreements are typically reached after expansive federal civil rights investigations, such as the probe of the Chicago police, released days before Trump took office, which determined that officers there routinely use excessive force and violate the rights of residents._line_ Before he was confirmed, Sessions said that consent decrees forcing reforms on departments can "undermine the respect for police officers." In April, the Justice Department said that officials would review all existing agreements to ensure they do not work against the Trump administration\'s goals of fighting violent crime while protecting officer safety and morale. Police departments have vowed to continue pushing for reforms._line_ During his speech Friday, Trump also returned to a familiar theme for him: invoking, and questioning, the levels of violence in Chicago. Speaking in New York, Trump appeared to tell a variation on a story he shared last year about an unnamed "top police officer" in the city who could stop the bloodshed there in a matter of days._line_(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)_line_'

S'A rare total solar eclipse will happen in the United States on August 21st, 2017. It will be a spectacle to see and the word is getting out to the public. Inevitably with science, misconceptions and inaccurate statements are emerging on social media. As a climate scientist, I am used to the public shaping its own understanding of science based on personal experiences or interpretations. People believe that deserts do not get cold or that climate change is not real because it snows in the winter, but I digress. It is important for scientists to help increase science literacy using \xe2\x80\x9cteachable moments.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought that it would be useful to clear up some of the emerging misconceptions about the Great American Eclipse that I noticed on my own social media pages. I suspect that they represent a sample of thoughts by others._line_Path of totality and what you will see._line_If you are not in the path of totality you will not experience anything. I recently pondered on social media about what local school systems in North Georgia and the Atlanta area would do with the students since peak darkness will be around 2:30 or so. This is the time that many schools in our area dismiss students. Given that most of the diagrams that I have seen in media outlets and websites show the path of 100% totality (as below), it is natural that some people might interpret that as meaning something is only going to happen in path of totality. I prefer the graphic shown above because it conveys much more information on what someone is likely to see given their position. I am a professor at the University of Georgia and we are hosting a massive viewing party in iconic Sanford Stadium. This map shows what we can expect in a region of 99.1% totality in Athens, Georgia. It should be noted that I captured a snapshot in time near Georgia, but I strongly recommend the full animation at this website developed by former colleagues of mine at NASA. As pointed out by colleagues at Great American Eclipse, viewing the full animation will prevent any misinterpretation of the snapshot image._line_Path of U.S. eclipse._line_We have seen eclipses before recently, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? Another common interpretation is that we have eclipses like this fairly regularly so why are scientists and the media making such a big deal about this one. According to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s website describing the August event_line_a total eclipse will cross the entire country, coast-to-coast, for the first time since 1918_line_For the United States, the total eclipse will begin in Lincoln City, Oregon and end somewhere around Charleston, South Carolina. Many have told me that they remember an eclipse happening a few years ago or when they were in school. Perhaps, they did but it was different from what we are about to experience. The NASA diagrams below show the types of eclipses that the United States and other parts of the world have experienced over the period 1981 to 2000 and 2000 to 2020, respectively. As you can see, there has been no total eclipse in the United States during that time period except the upcoming event. The year 1979 was the last time a total solar eclipse was visible from any part of the contiguous United States, but the path of totality could really only be viewed from Canada and northwestern states. In 1991, parts of Hawaii were near the path of totality of a total eclipse as well. If you click this link, it is an excellent resource for identifying when the next total eclipse path may be near you._line_Eclipses (1981 to 2000)_line_Eclipses (2000 to 2020)_line_There are different types of solar eclipses. NASA is obviously an excellent source for information on how they differ. According to the website_line_A total solar eclipse is only visible from a small area on Earth. The people who see the total eclipse are in the center of the moon\xe2\x80\x99s shadow when it hits Earth. The sky becomes very dark, as if it were night. For a total eclipse to take place, the sun, moon, and Earth must be in a direct line\xe2\x80\xa6.The second type of solar eclipse is a partial solar eclipse. This happens when the sun, moon, and Earth are not exactly lined up. The sun appears to have a dark shadow on only a small part of its surface\xe2\x80\xa6.The third type is an annular (ANN you ler) solar eclipse. An annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from Earth. Because the moon is farther away from Earth, it seems smaller. It does not block the entire view of the sun. The moon in front of the sun looks like a dark disk on top of a larger sun-colored disk. This creates what looks like a ring around the moon._line_If it is cloudy or raining, we will not experience anything. Many people will be traveling to the path of totality hoping for that once in a lifetime experience. Hotels are overbooked along the path, and I am sure the astute observer has considered the possibility of clouds. In a previous Forbes piece, I shared a useful tool for determining the probability of cloud cover where you may be. However, if it is overcast or cloudy near the path of totality, observers are still going to experience \xe2\x80\x9csomething.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the eclipse2017.org website states_line_If the sky is completely overcast, it will get VERY dark \xe2\x80\x93 pitch black, in fact, to the point where it will be tricky to walk around\xe2\x80\xa6If there are broken or scattered clouds, then you will have to hope that the Sun is not behind one of them at the time of totality\xe2\x80\xa6..If the Sun is behind a cloud during totality, you will still experience the temperature drop, and the sunset glow on the horizon \xe2\x80\x93 but this is not how you want to see a total eclipse!_line_Even if it is cloudy and you are near the eclipse path, something odd and cool will happen during the middle of the day._line_Oh, cool, we can make our own viewing glasses. One of the most important messages to convey is not to look directly at the eclipse with your naked eyes. You should only use sanctioned or certified eclipse-viewing glasses or some other type of solar viewer. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s website is very clear_line_The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as \xe2\x80\x9ceclipse glasses\xe2\x80\x9d (example shown at left) or hand-held solar viewers. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, are not safe for looking at the sun\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Do not look at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars, or another optical device. Similarly, do not look at the sun through a camera, a telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while using your eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewer \xe2\x80\x94 the concentrated solar rays will damage the filter and enter your eye(s), causing serious injury._line_There are various indirect alternatives like the Pinhole Camera or Viewer described here._line_Enjoy the eclipse safely._line_Updated at 5:13 pm_line_'

S' With the appetite for dining out taking a downward course as people increasingly choose to abstain from traffic and eat in the comfort of their homes, food-tech startups that cater to delivering this experience for them have been mushrooming over the years. This is corroborated in the overall investments in food-tech in 2016 which displayed a partial uptick from the previous year. _line_ However, even as investments have heated up, losses by these companies have also mounted by leaps and bounds as they fish around for a sustainable business model. It is in this scenario that a bunch of them are seen experimenting with a recipe that intents to not just leave their customers satiated, but also set their cash registers ringing. _line_ Labelled \'cloud kitchens\', some of the leading players in this space are waking up to this concept, tested and validated by FreshMenu back in 2014 when it first started off. _line_ "Unlike most food-tech companies that are fundamentally delivery-only platforms for existing network of restaurants, we additionally cook our own food, giving us end-to-end control over its quality, thereby improving customer experience," says founder, Rashmi Daga. "This also helps us manage orders better and trim costs," she adds. _line_ A kitchen-centric model that takes over the reins of preparation, packaging and delivery of food without providing any dine-in facility to end-consumers, it has been feeding the curiosity of startups that are looking to replace traditional business models with a more sustainable and scalable one. _line_Ka-ching! _line_ Although such an undertaking requires a lot of dough at the outset - starting from infrastructure costs to procuring ingredients and hiring quality chefs - Daga firmly believes that aggregation is not their cup of tea since there is no money to be made there. _line_ "Having control over supply will help reach profitability faster since you get a better cut of the overall order," she says. "Aggregators receive just a fraction of that - the rest is pocketed by restaurants and third party logistics, if delivery also is outsourced to external players," she added. _line_ Agrees co-founder and CEO of Foodpanda India, Saurabh Kochhar: "The more parts of the process that you own, the more control you have and the possibilities here are endless," he admits, but is quick to add that delivery by itself also offers room for innovation and experimentation. "Our core business will continue to be in food ordering and delivery and we will not be going into the kitchen side of things as of now," he says. _line_ Another aspect that gives cloud kitchens more flavour is the growing consumer proclivity to eat healthy food as against the greasy fare that fast-food establishments generally listed with these aggregators offer. _line_ "There may be hundreds of restaurants today for people to choose from, but those that offer good quality nutritious food are still in the minority," feels Daga. "At FreshMenu, we understand consumers\' needs and work with them to cull out different menus which are healthy without compromising on taste," she adds. _line_ Moreover, costs of maintaining a full-fledged restaurant - not to mention sky-high real estate prices at pricey locations - far outstrip the expenses of running kitchen-only units. _line_Food chain _line_ Up until now, most food-tech startups essentially provided a marketplace for restaurants to fuel their delivery sales, but this is beginning to change with established players like Swiggy and Zomato getting on the cloud kitchen bandwagon. _line_ Although this new model still involves partnership with restaurants listed on the aggregators\' platforms, it does give them better bargaining power and a bigger piece of the overall order value. _line_ Swiggy has been collaborating with popular restaurants in Bangalore to offer them access to localities where they do not have a physical presence, but may have potential customers. It dished out The Bowl Company on a pint-sized scale late last year whereby it has been teaming up with multiple brands that work out of a single kitchen, thus offering a well-curated menu to its users. _line_ Zomato - another votary of the model - also launched its rendition of a cloud kitchen in Delhi-NCR about three months ago, and like Swiggy, instead of taking ownership of the cooking process, is collaborating with partner restaurants to prepare the food. _line_ "We do not want to compete with our own clients," founder Deepinder Goyal had said in a company blogpost. "Through our cloud kitchen model, we will offer them kitchen infrastructure (and delivery) services and charge them a nominal percentage of their revenue," he had said. _line_Zomato Infrastructure Services - or ZIS - will build the kitchen and supply all equipments for partner restaurants to \'walk in and start their business in a matter of hours.\' Like the model followed by other players, this will also not have dine-in (or take-out) facilities and will only deliver food to customers. _line_ According to Goyal, the real opportunity for ZIS lies in second tier cities - that is, beyond the top metros where these restaurants already have a strong presence. "This can potentially give a huge boost to our online food ordering business," he says in the blog. "Business does not have to be a win-lose situation. Our ZIS team will act as a key partner for restaurants to make their business successful, and in the process, our business successful," he further adds. _line_ In theory, four or more restaurants will be co-located with each other and each will get roughly 300 sq ft to cook out of, leading to shared - and thus lower - costs. This strategy to support the presence of partner restaurants across the country to increase revenue generation is also closely followed by Mumbai-based Scootsy as it looks to scale going forward. _line_ "Going ahead, we will be opening pop-up kitchens across the country for restaurants that do not exist in that particular city," says CEO, Sandeep Das. "These restaurants will be rotated depending on their popularity. But at any given time, there will be four or five brands working together and we will prepare and deliver on their behalf," he adds. _line_Bland truth _line_ Despite the palatable nature of the model, as in the traditional business of food-tech, irregular pattern of delivery during lean hours of the day and high operational costs remain key challenges, even as it offers these companies a path to scale. _line_ "FreshMenu has been able to show both economics and scale and that is the attraction to getting into cloud kitchen," says Daga. "Our cost of delivery for each order has come down from Rs 100 in the first year of operation to half that amount today because of efficiencies of scale. And since we have been able to bundle delivery with food creation, we are able to create a better customer experience and retention rates. It is not easy, but if it takes off, it can be rewarding," she admits. _line_ Concurs Zomato\'s Goyal: "Like any other business, this also carries execution risks. But once we learn the business model\'s nuances, we will expand it further," he states in the blogpost. "As we scale this business, our costs of operation should come down further and increase our return on capital," he adds. _line_Tall order? _line_ According to a report by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation - a trust set up by the commerce ministry - India\'s food delivery market alone is worth $15 billion today. _line_ "India is a very large market and customers have different taste preferences which no brand can cater to single-handedly," says FreshMenu\'s Daga. "So it is a space where multiple companies will co-exist. And with time, as more and more people get online, the opportunity - as well as the challenges - will grow manifold" she adds. _line_ "By bringing convenience, choice, reliability and a great experience of food-ordering, Swiggy has become a loved consumer brand," says Srivats TS, VP Marketing at the company. In fact, Swiggy claims that it gets 5-6 repeat orders per customer per month - twice as much as any other competitor in the space today. _line_ "In fact, our top customers have ordered as often as 30 times a month," says Srivats. "India as a market holds tremendous potential for food-tech and as more players enter this space, it will bring opportunities and innovation that benefit the entire ecosystem," he adds. _line_  Goyal mirrors his optimism as he hopes that shared resources through the latest model will improve efficiencies and help keep unit economics positive. "Our initial estimates tell us that with some hard work, we can have 100 locations by the end of 2018," he adds. _line_'

S'Sri Lanka\'s cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha denies excluding Graham Ford from meetings while the latter was the team coach AFP/Getty Images_line_Graham Ford had disagreed with the appointment of Asanka Gurusinha as Sri Lanka\'s cricket manager "from the start", but there was no effort to exclude Ford from team matters, and no undue interference in Ford\'s role by the board, Gurusinha has said in an interview with ESPNcricinfo. Gurusinha also said his newly formed role does not unduly overlap with that of a head coach._line_Ford resigned in June, following what he felt were intrusions into what ought to have been his sphere of influence. Ford met with board officials in Colombo upon his return from the Champions Trophy. Having been told on that occasion that he would have to report to Gurusinha, he then declined to continue._line_"Graham, from the start, probably didn\'t agree with my role," Gurusinha said. "He thought I was interfering a lot more. I thought I wasn\'t. We did discuss it a lot. I am not sure what he discussed with the SLC president or anything like that. My role was always as a team manager and I will give certain ideas."_line_There are reports of several instances where Gurusinha and Ford differed during the Champions Trophy, including in the area of selection. As part of his duties as cricket manager, Gurusinha is also the selector on tour. But that is a power that he does not wield with unwarranted force, said Gurusinha._line_"At the end of the day, I do make the decision on the team - on the final XI. That decision is mine. But in my five months, I\'ve never gone against the captain\'s decision. With the head coach - I wouldn\'t say I always agree with everything. But I look at the fact that the captain goes to the middle with the team, not me. I have always given the team that the captain wanted. During the Champions Trophy, the final XI, even on things that I didn\'t agree, I always went with Angelo Mathews\' final decision. He has to go to the middle."_line_Allegations have also arisen that Ford was systematically pushed out by Gurusinha, who is claimed to have excluded Ford from team meetings, making Ford feel redundant. Gurusinha denied this._line_"There was nothing like that happening. We didn\'t have a single meeting without Graham Ford, if it was cricket-related. If it was administration- or security-related, we won\'t get Ford into those meetings. But anything with cricket or cricket selection, Graham was always there. Even though Graham is not a selector in SLC\'s selection policy, I always had him there. We always had the vice-captain there as well. It was a team that discussed everything, and I never excluded Graham."_line_Gurusinha described his role as one of coordinating with the head coach, the selectors, the high-performance centre, the players, and SLC. As such, he said he could act as a buffer between the coach and SLC\'s administrators, who have a long history of intruding into team matters._line_"It\'s important that you\'re clear with administrators and say: \'This is not part of your position. This is part of mine. Let me do it and trust me. I do respect SLC\'s policies and all of that - absolutely. But when it comes to decision-making, I always do everything within my powers._line_"But I haven\'t come across anything like that [intrusions by administrators]. I also have good relationships with SLC officials. And they do respect me for who I am."_line_The full interview with Asanka Gurusinha will be published on July 29_line_'

S'The turbulent history of HIV/AIDS_line_Paris (CNN)The evidence is in and the message is clear: When someone is HIV positive, taking regular treatment can pretty much zero their chance of spreading the infection to others during sex._line_Sexual transmission of HIV is negligible when someone is on treatment, whether they\'re in a heterosexual or homosexual relationship, according to results from previous studies and now a large-scale study of homosexual men, presented at the ninth International AIDS Conference on HIV Science in Paris on Tuesday._line_HIV experts emphasized this aspect of prevention, highlighting the "Undetectable equals Untransmissible" campaign, during a press conference at the international meeting. The campaign works to encourage people worldwide to stay on treatment by ensuring they understand that doing so could mean they cannot infect others._line_This message is not aligned with the status quo in terms of the care people infected with HIV receive today, believes Bruce Richman, founder and executive director of Prevention Access Campaign and the "Undetectable = Untransmittable" initiative. "This is transmission-stopping information," he said._line_New vaccine results have shown promise at the meeting this week and in recent studies, but are still far from becoming a reality to end the epidemic._line_Overwhelming evidence_line_In the largest-ever trial on HIV transmission risk among homosexual men, Australian researchers explored the sex lives and HIV rates of more than 350 homosexual couples where one person is HIV positive. The couples were from Brazil, Thailand and Australia._line_Each couple reported their sexual activity when visiting clinics involved in the trial and HIV-negative partners were regularly tested to diagnose any new infections._line_The couples participating reported having sex almost 17,000 times without condoms between them over four years, and none of those times resulted in new infections._line_"There was not a single linked HIV infection in these couples," said Andrew Grulich, professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the study. "Nobody became infected from their partner."_line_Three new infections were discovered during the trial, but analysis of the virus showed they had come from sex outside of the relationships, not from the person on treatment within the couple._line_Sex without a condom is not necessarily advised, however, to prevent risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). "This (group) had very high STIs," Grulich told CNN, adding that 20% of the men in the trial developed STIs each year, yet there were zero HIV infections. _line_Approximately 10% of men had STIs associated with anal sex, which experts had previously thought aided HIV transmission, Gulich said._line_The new evidence builds on previous studies on couples where one partner is HIV positive and on treatment, including a landmark study in 2011 that found that treatment can prevent new infections among couples by 96% and a second study in Europe in 2016 showing no transmission at all._line_Treatment as prevention is now recommended by the World Health Organization as a key component to include in HIV prevention programs,_line_The latest trial is the first to explore the benefits of treatment as prevention across multiple continents, showing this approach could be universally applicable. "We wanted to see if this could be applied in different settings where there are also HIV epidemics among homosexual men," said Grulich._line_An estimated 68% of new HIV infections in Australia in 2015 were among homosexual men, according to the Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations._line_The preventative effects are particularly strong due to the increased risk of transmission that comes with anal sex._line_Protective, despite greater risk_line_"We know transmission risk by anal sex is approximately 10 times higher than risk by vaginal sex," said Grulich, who feared this could lead to some infections during the trial. "This provides reassuring evidence that treatment is as effective in homosexual men," he said._line_"This (study) is confirmation of something we have known for some time," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, within the US National Institutes of Health. _line_The fact that transmission risk is clearly greater by anal intercourse shows this is a powerful tool for prevention, he said. "Now is the time to push for it."_line_International AIDS Society President Linda-Gail Bekker believes working to ensure more people get tested for HIV and therefore treated is a crucial component of the current fight against the virus, but not necessarily the immediate one._line_"Let\'s have a reductionist approach, but I think there is also lag in terms of treatment as prevention. You\'ve got to get things up to scale," she told CNN. In the meantime, she said, the services we already have for people who are uninfected to protect themselves should be pushed._line_These currently available services include high-risk groups taking drugs to prevent infection, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medical male circumcision, which can reduce transmission from women to men by 60%, and condom use. "That will curb the transmission rate more quickly" while we begin treatment as prevention and wait for it to become more widely available globally, she said._line_Bekker used the example of Swaziland, where rates of HIV were reported on Monday to have dramatically declined since 2011, according to the US President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Swaziland has the highest prevalence of HIV in the world, but new infections have almost halved since 2011, after providing treatment and male circumcision for more than 12 million people._line_By the time these prevention options are extensively promoted and provided to those who need them, Bekker hopes a vaccine may then finally ready. This would truly eliminate the disease, rather than control it, she believes._line_New vaccine promise_line_Results from a recent vaccine trial, known as the APPROACH trial, were presented at the conference Monday and revealed this type of vaccine could instigate an immune response against HIV when tested on almost 400 volunteers across five countries._line_The type used were mosaic vaccines, where components of different HIV viruses are combined together to create an immune response in the body._line_Seven different regimens of the vaccine were tested and all elicited an immune response and were well tolerated in the body. One that previously showed promise in animals shined through, giving the strongest response in humans._line_The researchers stress, however, that simply because an immune response was created does not mean it will prevent someone becoming infected with HIV._line_"The promising, early-stage results from the APPROACH study support further evaluation of these candidate vaccines to assess their ability to protect those at risk of acquiring HIV," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a principal investigator for APPROACH, in a statement._line_Join the conversation_line_See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter._line_"A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic," said Fauci, whose institute supported the trial. "By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals." _line_Bekker added that this is one of three avenues currently being explored to create an effective vaccine against HIV, including one being trialed in her home country, South Africa. Whichever one wins the race, it can\'t come fast enough._line_"Finally, a vaccine will clean (HIV infections) up" after these prevention services are in place, she said. "And hopefully eliminate HIV."_line_'

S'New Delhi: The Union Finance Minister, Sh. Arun Jaitley today stated that the opportunities presented by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework and Government\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on resolution represent a unique opportunity for Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) and Private Equity firms (PE). At a meeting today with leading ARCs and PE firms focussed on stressed assets, he said that accounts classified as impaired/stressed still had inherent value. These were essentially productive assets which if turned around would not only create additional jobs but also contribute to national output. For this to happen, timely interventions, transparent price discovery and right management were required._line_Sh. Jaitley highlighted the legislative and regulatory changes made over the last 18 months which had created an enabling and supportive operational environment for ARCs and for takeover of stressed assets by PE firms/special situation funds. These, inter alia, include 100% ownership by sponsors, higher ceiling of 100% for FDI in ARCs, pass through status to ARC trusts for income tax, exemption from stamp duty, enabling trading of security receipts etc. He noted that a number of new ARCs have sought and obtained registration during recent months. The increasing number of players in the market was indicative of an increasing interest in the sector but also presented an opportunity for banks to offload stressed assets before fully provisioning for them. The ratio of cost of acquisition to book value of assets acquired by ARCs has been rising. Within this overall context, the ARCs and PE funds were well placed to step up their activity levels as all the building blocks were there._line_During discussions, ARCs and PE firms were appreciative of the steps taken so far by the Government and RBI. The need for evolution of targeted case specific solution by ARCs/PE funds was brought out, as these entities have higher operational flexibility. Prospects for capital raising and deployment were highlighted. It was suggested that sale of project loan by a consortium instead of individual banks selling their loan account could be a much more effective way of ensuring debt aggregation in a timely manner. Suggestions were also made regarding increase in activity levels of ARCs and PE funds._line_Taking note of the feedback, Shri Jaitley observed that Govt. and RBI had greatly facilitated the role of ARCs and Special Situation funds in effective resolution. Resultant collaboration between banks, ARCs, PE, Asset Management Companies and resolution professionals could pave the way to a virtuous cycle of fresh investments, new jobs and additional demand._line_'

Alphabet shares barely wobbled, however, following the Q2 results, which saw sales climb to $26 billion, up 21 percent year-on-year, while earnings per share stood at $5.01._line_Google is yet to confirm whether it plans to appeal against the penalty, which Brussels\' competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, meted out to the company after she concluded that it had breached EU rules "by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors."_line_Ars understands that, prior to Google being lumped with the fine\xe2\x80\x94which it was privately expecting\xe2\x80\x94the ad giant had weakened its rhetoric about appealing against the commission\'s decision.

S'A kaleidoscopic vision of the city through nine stories by various writers and artists_line_  Eighteen artists and writers from the city have collaborated to come out with a graphic novel that is a tribute of sorts to the city of Bengaluru. Through nine illustrated stories conceptualized by a mix of established artists as well those just breaking into the field, the anthology portrays a vision that melds past, present and future of the city in their signature styles. _line_  Speaking about the novel, Jai Undurti, creative director of a graphic novel publishing house, says, "The novel is the second part of our Every City Is A Story series, in which we try to capture the essence of a region through graphic art. The idea for Bengaluru came after our first for Hyderabad in 2014 became a hit, and we invited various artists across the city to send in their ideas. While the e-book version of this novel was released in February earlier this year, owing to a lot of request for it to be an actual book, we\'ve also brought out the hard-copy version." _line_  The stories range from a variety of topics. One imagines Bengaluru 20 years from now, while another looks back at the city that was. The other elements include a fictional occult \'origin\' story, ATM theft, and more. _line_  Speaking about the experience, Sreejita Biswas, who goes by the name Solo and has written the story about a vigilante operating from the roofs of Bengaluru, says, "Ojo, my junior from college, and I have been working together for a while now, coming up with graphic comics every Sunday for our webzine, which have even been published in Japan. In that respect, this has been an extension of the work we have been doing. It has been quite interesting to have contributed to a novel that is a tribute to this beautiful city." _line_  Artist Appupen, whose story is the first in the novel, says, "A book of this sort has never been done for Bengaluru before. I hope people do not consider this as just a comic book for light reading, and instead spend a little more time exploring the finer aspects of our drawing and stories. A lot of thought has been put into the stories in this book, and fully experiencing will make you appreciate both the artists and the city better." _line_'

S'The more than 200-foot wide and 50-foot deep sinkhole that swallowed homes is far from the state\'s first._line_On an average day in Land O\'Lakes, Florida, the ground opened up and swallowed a house whole._line_The house was the latest victim of one of the many sinkholes plaguing Florida. According to Florida news outlet WFLA, two homes, a boat, a driveway, and a portion of the road was sucked into the ground. _line_Video taken at the scene on July 14 shows a home quickly collapsing downward, as if hit from above by an invisible bulldozer. A front exterior wall fell into a gurgling pit of mud, revealing the family\'s living room. While no one was hurt from the incident, the home was destroyed and several others had to be evacuated. _line_Comparatively, the affected families got off lucky. In 2013, one sinkhole near Tampa opened up in the middle of the night under the bedroom of Jeff Bush, killing him. The same sinkholes reopened again in 2015, though this time no one was hurt. _line_Land O\'Lakes is in Pasco Couty, north of Tampa. The new hole is 225 feet wide and 50 feet deep\xe2\x80\x94the largest in the region\'s history. _line_A Deadly Phenomenon_line_"Sinkholes are probably the least studied hazardous phenomenon on our planet," said Hofstra University geology professor Robert Brinkmann. Brinkmann has been at the forefront of understanding how sinkholes impact urban and suburban areas, so much so that he even wrote a book about it in 2013. _line_He explained that Florida has a landscape uniquely susceptible to sinkholes. The state sits over carbonate rock made of mostly limestone and dolostone. _line_(Read about how melting permafrost in Siberia is creating a \'Doorway to Hell.\') _line_Sinkholes usually form gradually. When finer, sandlike sediment sits over bedrock it can fill the cracks and holes. As the sandier sediment creeps downward, the land sitting atop it subsides. As the void grows, or if top sediment is suddenly washed away by water, sinkholes can form (and are often filled with water). _line_Occasionally, underground cavities can form under surface rock. When the cavity expands so much that the surface can no longer support its weight, it suddenly collapses. _line_A 2015 survey conducted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection mapped Florida\'s vulnerability to sinkholes. _line_Researchers found that the southern tip and northernmost regions of Florida had anywhere from 500 to 1,000 feet of overlaying sediment to act as a buffer between the surface and the state\'s tumultuous limestone. Areas near the northwestern coast, however, were found to have as little as 10 feet of rock acting as a buffer. This coincided geographically with where sinkholes in Florida are typically reported. _line_The study\'s maps allow state planners to accurately zone residential and commercial areas. Once property is built over an area susceptible to a sinkhole, little can be done to stop a potential collapse, so avoiding the area altogether is the only sure way to avoid the disaster. _line_Are Sinkholes on the Rise? _line_Florida\'s 2015 study found that, in addition to the natural geological events that create sinkholes, certain human activities\xe2\x80\x94such as water pumping and ground loading\xe2\x80\x94may make the Earth\'s surface more vulnerable. _line_It\'s a misconception, says Brinkmann, that sinkholes are increasing in number, at least in Florida. As suburban areas expand into regions that are more prone to sinkholes, the number of incidences of damage simply becomes more likely. _line_While human activity can make the rate at which a sinkhole forms more rapid, he notes, it rarely causes geologically formed sinkholes to appear. Sinkholes have appeared in urban areas; however, these often result from the collapse of unstable infrastructure. _line_(Read about one explorer\'s descent into a "fiery, gas-fueled crater.") _line_In 2013, Mother Jones magazine reported on a town in Bayou Corne, Louisiana, that was being swallowed by a sinkhole. The town is home to a massive industrial complex where hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has taken place, leading some to speculating that the rapid increase in underground drilling had created the sinkhole. _line_Brinkmann didn\'t know of any studied link between fracking and sinkholes and said more research would be needed to confirm the link. _line_While some states keep individual databases of sinkhole incidences, no national databases are available. _line_'

S'Bhubaneswar: Voice for Child Rights in Odisha (VCRO), in collaboration with CRY \xe2\x80\x93 Child Rights and You, a leading child rights organisation, launched a campaign, \xe2\x80\x98Giving Children of Odisha A Healthy Start\xe2\x80\x99, to address the issue of child health and malnutrition in five tribal districts of Odisha._line_ With almost 35% of total under-5 child population in the state under-weight, and 45% children in the same age-group suffering from anaemia, Odisha is one of the states which lag behind the National status of child health and malnutrition. The scenario is even worse in tribal districts of the state, as data suggest. Despite the recent decline in infant and child mortality (IMR and U5MR), the state still fares poorly in comparison to the National estimate. As NFHS 4 data reveals, 40 children (per 1000 live birth) still die within the first year of life, and 49 (per 1000 live birth) die before they reach 5 years of age._line_ Keeping this ground-reality in mind, the aim of the six month long campaign will be to reduce the rate of child malnutrition below the National average, through increasing awareness and participation of the communities and concerned service providers at the village level, as stated by the organising NGOs._line_The State Social Welfare Board and the Odisha Chapter of National Health Mission (NHM) welcomed the initiative by CRY and VCRO. They also expressed hope that this kind of awareness drives should be extended to the entire state._line_ Litika Pradhan, Chirperson Social Welfare Board said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s significant that the campaign aims at coordination and convergence of government and non-government bodies to ensure health and nutrition for children and mothers.\xe2\x80\x9d She also advocated for children\xe2\x80\x99s cr\xc3\xa8ches at the village level, so that working mothers in the rural areas can avail the opportunity to ensure nutrition and care for their children._line_ Dr. Prasant Saboth of NHM said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven though we have resources, changing the mindset of people is the biggest challenge. Health and hygiene are important components in reducing malnutrition, and this campaign will go a long way towards building mass awareness and ensuring best practices among the communities.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ The campaign will reach out to more than 5000 children and 3000 mothers in 158 villages in 10 blocks of five backward districts, namely Mayurbhanj, Bolangir, Bargarh, Kalahandi, and Koraput, as the grass-roots level NGOs partnering CRY and VCRO will be involved in collection of data from the respective intervention villages to assess the nutritional status of children in the age group of 0-5 years._line_ Explaining the plan and modality of the campaign Ashim Kumar Ghosh, Chief of CRY operations in Odisha said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe campaign is divided into two components. While the first includes growth monitoring of 0-5 years children in the mentioned districts and advocate for the development of malnourished children with the support of state agencies and communities, the second aspect aims at advocacy towards enhanced Implementation of Policy, Scheme, legislation and services at the grass root level on health policy for the mothers and children below 5 years.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ Elaborating the approach of the action-intensive campaign, Bidyut Mohanty, Convenor of VCRO said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will work on both responsive and preventive ways, with all respective stakeholders bringing them at one platform to operate at the village levels.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_ \xe2\x80\x9cOn one hand the campaigners will identify critically malnourished children to refer them for further treatment and ensure that the communities are better prepared to prevent malnourishment; and on the other the service providers will be roped in to enhance the quality of services with certain non-negotiable mandate from the State,\xe2\x80\x9d Mohanty added._line_'

S' Meerut: Two dreaded criminals were gunned down on early Saturday morning after a fierce exchange of fire with a police team, an encounter which also rendered five policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), injured in a Shamli village._line_  A 17-member police team raided Bhura village on Saturday morning after getting a tip-off that notorious criminal Mohammad Naushad (29) was hiding in a home there. Naushad had as many as 20 cases of murder, loot and drugs supply registered against him and police had announced a reward of Rs 60,000 on any information leading to his arrest._line_  A terror in the region, Naushad was a member of Mukim Kala gang.

However, the accused and his accomplice, Sarvar Kamil-- also a criminal-- opened fire at the policemen, forcing them to retaliate._line_  SHO of Jhinjhana police station, Bhagwat Singh, and four other policemen were injured in the firing. After a brief encounter, both the criminals were shot dead. A .12 bore double-barrel gun, a pistol and a cache of live cartridges were found near the bodies of the criminals, police said.  Interestingly, the encounter brought back Bhura village into limelight. The tiny village has been notorious for harbouring criminals._line_  \xe2\x80\x9cAs many as 30 people were arrested recently for their alleged involvement in different criminal activities, including drug peddling,\xe2\x80\x9d the SP said._line_  Meanwhile, relatives of the two criminals slammed police for the encounter, claiming that the duo were \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent\xe2\x80\x9d._line_  Jameel Ahmad, the father of Naushad, said, \xe2\x80\x9cJust see our homes and judge our financial condition. Had my son been such a big criminal, as portrayed by police, is it possible that we would be living in such a dire condition?\xe2\x80\x9d_line_  Similarly, Hameeda Begum, the mother of Sarvar Kamil, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son was a labourer. He was killed because police wanted to score brownie points. I will approach NHRC against this fake encounter.\xe2\x80\x9d _line_'

S"Your complete guide to mastering the Spanish essential and scoring perfect soccarat _line_Paella comes from the countryside around Valencia, where it began as a humble dish for workers in the orchards and vegetable fields. They simmered what ingredients they could find\xe2\x80\x94tomatoes, beans, rabbit, snails\xe2\x80\x94in a wide pan over the cuttings of orange trees before adding rice to absorb the flavors and make a filling midday meal. From there, paella drifted into villages and then cities and eventually became Spain\xe2\x80\x99s national dish._line_Along the way, it became a tourist-trap staple. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate truth: Few restaurants serve decent paella, even in Spain. Industrially produced frozen versions, tricks like doctoring parboiled rice with coloring additives in place of saffron, and nontraditional ingredients like lobster and chorizo are a common, dispiriting sight._line_Paella is at its best cooked at home, made with traditional, shortcut-free technique and served the moment it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to an appreciative crowd. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I learned 20 years ago when I moved to Spain and married into a family with roots in Valencia for whom making paella has been a weekend ritual for more than 40 years. Nothing in Spanish cooking compares to carrying a massive pan of golden-brown rice out to the table, or the pleasures of digging into one. And while paella has a lot of details to sweat and rules to follow, the most important is simple: There is no such thing as a version for just one person. As one aunt in the family village in rural Valencia says, \xe2\x80\x9cPaella is really just an excuse to gather people.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_1) Pick the Right Rice_line_Use fresh, fragrant fish stock (below) when making shellfish paella. Include small, non-oily fish like red mullet and monkfish or cod heads and bones._line_Paella is a rice dish. Not a dish of rabbit or seafood along with some rice. Rice is the foundation, and everything is done to flavor the grains. Short- or medium-grain rice soaks up the most liquid and flavor. The best options are varieties from Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s rice fields like bah\xc3\xada, senia, and bomba. Bomba is the most forgiving of the three and the least likely to split open and lose its texture if the timing isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect. In a pinch, substitute Italian carnaroli, arborio, Calrose, or Japanese short-grain rice. Just avoid long-grain rices, which do a poor job of absorbing as much of the stock\xe2\x80\x94and all the flavor that comes with it._line_2) Get Extra Crispy_line_An ideal paella has a thin layer of toasted, slightly caramelized rice on the bottom of the pan\xe2\x80\x94the socarrat. Some cooks chase it by boosting the heat for the final minute or two of cooking, but beware: This greatly increases the risk of scorching. Even heat and proper timing are much safer. Practice makes perfect._line_3) Stick to True Ingredients_line_The question of what has a right to go in the pan can inspire garment-rending passion among paella partisans. Purists will argue there is only one true paella, the classic from Valencia that generally includes rabbit, chicken, two or three types of fresh, local beans, and snails or a sprig of rosemary. (Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s snails or rosemary: Valencian snails cling to this herb and bring some of its essence to the rice on their own.) But there are many combinations recognized by all but the most extreme traditionalists, from paellas that celebrate the arrival of spring produce, like rabbit and artichoke, to my mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s specialty, shellfish. Olive oil and tomatoes are obligatory, as are saffron and sweet Spanish paprika, which give the dish its aroma and color. One thing to leave out: chorizo. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not done. Along with being a slap in the face to tradition, it can overwhelm the other flavors._line_Go the extra mile to use bone-in meats and whole shrimp and prawns. Remember how all the other ingredients are mostly there to flavor the rice? Bones, shells, and heads mean deeper flavors in the stock that the rice cooks in._line_4) Don't Say 'Paella Pan'_line_The traditional wide, shallow pan gives the dish its name\xe2\x80\x94paella means \xe2\x80\x9cpan\xe2\x80\x9d in Valencian and Catalan\xe2\x80\x94and it allows the rice to cook evenly without being stirred, which aids the formation of a crispy socarrat. A generously sized pan also doubles as a communal plate._line_Size: To ensure even cooking, the rice needs to remain in a thin, consistent layer. The bigger the crowd, the wider your pan should be. The ideal size for four is 17 to 18 inches; for six it\xe2\x80\x99s 18 or 19._line_Material: Use pans made of a thin, conductive metal that will cool rapidly when removed from the heat so the rice won\xe2\x80\x99t overcook. In Spain, the typical pan is made from carbon steel. They\xe2\x80\x99re inexpensive but need special care and seasoning. If that sounds like a pain, enameled steel pans are a good compromise: They are more expensive but easier to maintain. Avoid heavy pans like cast iron, which don\xe2\x80\x99t cool quickly enough, and anything nonstick, since a little sticking helps develop a crispy socarrat._line_5) But Do Season It_line_Saffron, tomatoes, and sweet paprika are necessary to any paella base. They provide color and subtle flavor._line_To season a new carbon-steel pan, simmer an equal mixture of water and vinegar in the pan for 5 or 10 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap and water. Next, boil a few handfuls of rice in plenty of water in the pan for another 5 or 10 minutes. Discard the rice, wash the pan again, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ready for use._line_6) Mind Your Heat Source_line_Paella is a dry rice, which means that the liquid must be completely absorbed at the precise moment the rice is done. Missing the mark can lead to undercooked grains or a mushy paella. Finding a wide, stable, and powerful source of heat that will evenly reach the entire pan is key to success. Outside, that means cooking in a fire pit over open flames or, less traditionally but no less effectively, on a grill. Inside, try straddling two or three stovetop burners and frequently rotating the pan._line_7) Serve it Right_line_As my mother-in-law always says, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can wait for rice, but rice can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for people.\xe2\x80\x9d Wait until all of your guests arrive before adding the rice. And don't stir. This is not risotto. Stirring means a creamy rather than dry texture, and you also won\xe2\x80\x99t get any socarrat._line_Before serving, let the paella rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend and the starches in the rice to firm up so the grains will hold their shape. If the top layer of rice needs to cook more, cover the pan with paper towels or a clean kitchen cloth while it rests. And don\xe2\x80\x99t plate in the kitchen. Let your guests admire the finished dish at the table. The best way to honor the rustic roots of the dish is to have them eat directly from the pan with spoons._line_8) Pick Up These Tools_line_To make the ultimate Paella you need the proper tools._line_Wide, shallow, and ideally made of carbon steel, a paella pan is necessary to cook the rice evenly. Use a long, flat spoon to mix things up before the rice is added. When cooking over an open fire, place the pan over a low, iron stand to keep it close to the flame._line_9) And Read Up_line_La Paella (Left) Grape, Olive, Pig: Deep Travels Through Spain's Food (Right)_line_La Paella by Jeff Koehler_line_ \xe2\x80\x9cThe liquid must be completely absorbed at the precise moment that the rice is al punto [at the point],\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote in my book La Paella. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here lies the challenge, in a shifting equation of pan, heat source, and liquid.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Grape, Olive, Pig: Deep Travels Through Spain's Food by Matt Goulding_line_ \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look closely enough, you will find the entire history of Spain within the perimeter of a paella pan,\xe2\x80\x9d opens Matt Goulding\xe2\x80\x99s chapter on Valencia in Grape, Olive, Pig, a deep dive into the dish synonymous with the region and the fight for authentic paella._line_"

S'(Representative image)_line_ NEW DELHI: Next time you land at IGI from an eastern European destination or Russia, don\'t panic if your checked-in luggage takes a long time to arrive. _line_ Customs authorities may be scanning your bags for any signs of dogs tucked away in suitcases. Cases have emerged of passengers trying to smuggle in dogs stuffed in suitcases. "The dogs are sedated or stunned and put in bags," said a source. They are sometimes stuffed in between clothes and other items to mask them during scanning. _line_  "The animal goes through a lot of suffering. It is really painful to see them stuffed in bags," said the source. _line_ Last year, customs authorities managed to intercept several passengers trying to smuggle in pregnant dogs in a similar fashion. "These are some exotic breeds and they are sold in the local markets at a premium," said the source. _line_ One flyer was detained after a dog was found stuffed in her handbag. Authorities had hoped the practice would stop but it has resumed this year with the detection of new cases. _line_ "We keep a close watch on flights from Russia and those which arrive from eastern Europe," said the source. He said organized syndicates were at work but the customs authorities have been able to thwart their efforts. _line_ Customs sources said efforts are made to smuggle in several other breeds for "dog fights", which are popular in parts of Punjab and in some farm houses in the capital. They said investigations are on, involving various agencies to establish the trail. _line_ "These dogs are sedated, they are hungry and when they are made to fight they often end up killing the opponent," said the source, adding that the department was probing the cases to end the menace. Any passenger who plans to bring a pet has to obtain a certificate from the authorities in order to import the pet. _line_ In several cases customs officials have found that the same certificate was being recycled. "We have come across several cases where an attempt to recycle the same certificate was made. Our officers nabbed them each time," said the source. _line_ Senior revenue department officials said they are probing all the cases and are trying to find out the end beneficiaries of this smuggling racket. _line_'

S"Retail listings for an upcoming refresh of the Acer Swift 3 suggest that Intel may have plans to release a new line of low-power quad-core i5 processors before the end of the year._line_According to PC Perspective, the retail listings state clearly that the processor is a quad-core Intel Core i5-8250U. That model number suggests it's not just a new quad-core i5, but a new 8th-generation processor._line_This new processor is a bit of an oddity. To discuss why, let's have a look at its name. The i5-8250U name tells us a lot about this processor. First, that it's an i5, that it's part of Intel's 8th-generation lineup, and the U at the end means its a low-power chip -- the kind we see in razor-thin laptops like the Acer Swift 3._line_Now that we know it's a quad-core chip and a low-power chip, things start to get interesting. Currently, Intel Core i5 and i7 processors of the U-variety are only available in dual-core configurations. Some have hyperthreading, which means they can handle a number of processing threads equal to double the number of cores they have -- in this case four. But none have four physical cores._line_But this new i5-8250U has not only four physical cores, but it also has hyperthreading. That makes it unlike any other U-series processor on the market today._line_After doing some digging, PC Perspective found a number of results in the Geekbench database for the i5-8250U, from upcoming laptops like the Dell XPS 13 9360. According to the Geekbench results, the quad-core i5-8520U with hyperthreading is capable of outperforming a current generation i5-7200U in multi-core performance by about 54 percent._line_Its single-core performance is about the same, though, so it's a boost you'll only notice when you're doing some serious multi-tasking or running processor-intensive applications._line_That's beside the point, though. Sure, there are laptops out there with Intel Core i5 and i7 chips that can run circles around this i5-8250U, but they all use a lot more power. The only other quad-core i5 -- with hyperthreading -- on the market is a 65-watt chip. The exact power target of the i5-8250U is unknown, but its performance and name suggest it'll be substantially less. That should allow for a new breed of thin, yet powerful, workstation._line_"

Immediately . contact the animal husbandry department or government vet in your area . Ring up an animal welfare organisation or gaushala and ask them for an animal ambulance. Explain the injury and ask them to bring first aid and pain killers with them. Offer to pay as all animal organisations get no money from any sources except public donations. If the ambulance is not available, take the animal to a hospital shelter or a vet. In order to stop bleeding wounds, place a compress of clean cloth or gauze directly over the wound, applying firm but gentle pressure, and allow it to clot. If a wound on the leg or foot is bleeding severely, gently elevate the leg until the wound is above the heart. This allows gravity to reduce blood pressure near the wound which will slow the bleeding.

S' (CNN)It may not be like the alien life in science fiction, but researchers have just confirmed the presence of something that may lead to life on Titan, Saturn\'s largest moon, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances._line_Vinyl cyanide is a complex organic molecule capable of forming cell membrane-like spheres. While it may sound toxic, this chemical would be right at home on Titan, where significant quantities of it have been detected through data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a group of radio telescopes in Chile._line_Titan isn\'t exactly known for being hospitable. _line_Larger than both our own moon and the planet Mercury, Titan is unique in our solar system. It is the only moon with clouds and a dense atmosphere of nitrogen and methane, which gives it a fuzzy orange appearance._line_Its atmospheric pressure is 60% greater than Earth\'s, meaning it exerts the kind of pressure you feel at the bottom of a swimming pool, according to NASA._line_So it would make sense that the potential for life on Titan would have to look a little different. But Titan\'s atmosphere may not be much different than that of primordial Earth\'s -- and life found a way here._line_Titan also has Earth-like liquid bodies on its surface, but the rivers, lakes and seas are made of liquid ethane and methane, which form clouds and cause liquid gas to rain from the sky. _line_The surface temperature is so cold -- minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- that the rivers and lakes were carved out by methane, the way rocks and lava helped to form features and channels on Earth. _line_These methane pools on the surface are the kind of environment that could help vinyl cyanide molecules link together to form cell-like membranes, not unlike the basis for organisms on Earth. _line_"The presence of vinyl cyanide in an environment with liquid methane suggests the intriguing possibility of chemical processes that are analogous to those important for life on Earth," said Maureen Palmer, lead study author and researcher at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center._line_The ALMA data confirmed what previous studies and simulations, like one from Cornell University in 2015, had predicted about the potential presence of this molecule on Titan. _line_"Researchers definitively discovered the molecule, vinyl cyanide, that is our best candidate for a \'protocell\' that might be stable and flexible in liquid methane," said Jonathan Lunine, a Cornell professor who participated in the 2015 study. "This is a step forward in understanding whether Titan\'s methane seas might host an exotic form of life."_line_Titan is also believed to have an internal liquid water ocean, like those on Europa, one of Jupiter\'s moons, and Enceladus, another of Saturn\'s moons. Earlier this year, NASA announced that Europa and Enceladus\' oceans have some or most of the ingredients necessary for life as we know it. _line_But how does Titan compare? First of all, it\'s bigger than Europa and Enceladus. It\'s also entirely unique in its possession of a dense atmosphere, which has obscured the observations that researchers have tried to make of Titan. And Titan doesn\'t have confirmed active geysers on its surface._line_Given its complex chemistry, it\'s safe to say that Titan isn\'t hospitable to humans. But it is attractive to researchers. _line_NASA\'s Cassini spacecraft mission to Saturn comes to an end later this year, but proposed mission concepts already exist for a type of "Titan airplane" called the AVIATR (Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance) and a submarine that would explore Titan\'s seas. _line_"Saturn\'s moon, Enceladus, is the place to search for life like us, life that depends on -- and exists in -- liquid water," Lunine said. "Titan, on the other hand, is the place to go to seek the outer limits of life -- can some exotic type of life begin and evolve in a truly alien environment, that of liquid methane?"_line_'

In 2012 then prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani was disqualified over contempt of court charges for refusing to reopen a corruption case against President Asif Ali Zardari._line_Also no Pakistani prime minister has ever completed a full five-year elected term. Most tenures have been cut short by military coups._line_While serving as the country\'s Prime Minister in 1993, Sharif was sacked by the then-president over graft allegations, while in 1999 he was ousted in a military coup.

S'"You have an emotional attachment to your oil diffuser," my boss said with a smile and a laugh. And she was right; after two years of relying (partly) on essential oils as a tool to mitigate anxiety and depression, I really do have an emotional attachment to it.

I went out immediately to a natural market, bought a diffuser and some lavender oil, and went home to begin a practice that would soon become an everyday ritual._line_Though not a cure-all, essential oils have been studied and shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression, at least a little bit. And while I don\'t credit aromatherapy for the entirety of my recovery and everyday balance, it really has become a fantastic form of self-care, something that is imperative to prioritize when you\'re dealing with any form of mental illness, mood disorder, or emotional turmoil._line_There are dozens of natural treatments for anxiety, but I\'m by no means suggesting you ignore the option of medication \xe2\x80\x94 I found a way to deal with my own mental health via alternative medicine, and if that\'s an avenue you\'re interested in exploring, I\'d highly suggest using aromatherapy and oil diffusing as part of your holistic, comprehensive mental healthcare routine, especially before bedtime!

S'The bill introduces the much-needed concept of affixing liability on a manufacturer or producer and even a product seller in certain specified circumstances for any personal injury, death or property damage caused to a consumer resulting from defects in manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging, or labelling of any product._line_ NEW DELHI: A new consumer protection bill that is likely to be tabled during Parliament\'s ongoing monsoon session is seen as the next big game-changer for the common man, replacing as it will legislation that has been in force since 1986 when the economic landscape and consumer awareness were in their infancy. _line_ Among a slew of measures, the bill proposes to establish an investigating, prosecuting, reviewing and recommending body -- the Central Consumer Protection Authority, on the lines of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), headed by a Commissioner -- to launch inquiries, either suo motu or on a complaint or direction from the government, into violations of consumer rights and to launch prosecution in an appropriate court. _line_ The bill introduces the much-needed concept of affixing liability on a manufacturer or producer and even a product seller in certain specified circumstances for any personal injury, death or property damage caused to a consumer resulting from defects in manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging, or labelling of any product. _line_ One of the interesting new additions to minimise frivolous litigation is the requirement to deposit 50 per cent of the total amount that the defendant has been asked to pay in terms of the appealable order in case he intends to prefer an appeal to an Appellate Commission. _line_ The penalty for filing a frivolous complaint has also been proposed to be enhanced from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 to minimise baseless and false complaints. _line_ In keeping with the changing times, the Bill defines e-commerce while at the same time empowering the Centre to make rules for preventing unfair trade practices in online trade. It also brings new forms of trade under the purview of the act to safeguard the interests of consumers further. _line_ Once the new law comes into force, the liability of manufacturers and service providers, online and offline, will not be primarily limited to any consumer who buys goods or avails service but towards all consumers. This leads towards the class action suits introduction in the country in which all affected consumers will derive benefits. _line_ The three-tier structure for adjudicating consumer disputes still remains in the form of district, state and national commissions but with enhanced values at each level looking at the current market realities. _line_ "We believe that the consumer is the most important stakeholder in the supply chain and bringing higher value to the consumer is sine quo non for survival in a competitive business environment... It is, therefore, important that such consumer protection laws are within the constitutional framework while providing effective, quick and realistic remedies to the consumers," FICCI Secretary General A. Didar Singh told IANS. _line_ "The consumer protection bill is sought to bring substantial modifications to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to address emergence of global supply chains, rapid development of e-commerce and to tackle misleading advertisements, telemarketing, multi-level marketing and direct selling," he added. _line_ Bejon Misra, a consumer policy expert and founder, Consumer Online Foundation, told IANS: "The three-decade-old Consumer Protection Act in its present form is an inefficient piece of legislation not keeping pace with the new market dynamics, multi-layered delivery chains, innovative and many times misleading advertising and marketing machinery." _line_ "In the changing market place with e-commerce and financial products having made heavy inroads, the outdated Consumer Protection Act of 1988 serves little or no purpose in protecting consumers. Blatant misleading advertisements are selling norms today. Thus the only way to protect consumers from falling prey is to introduce authoritative powers, strengthening of consumer commissions, class action suits, penalties and host of other measures as exist in the draft amendment bill," Ashim Sanyal, COO of NGO Consumer VOICE, told IANS. _line_  The bill, originally drafted in 2015 and tabled in the Lok Sabha last year, was subsequently sent to the Standing Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs. It now awaits cabinet approval. Even though it figures in the Lok Sabha\'s list of business for the monsoon session, this can happen only after the cabinet\'s nod. _line_'

S'Nagpur: Taking forward the causes that she works for under Gram Project at Paradsinga, artist Shweta Bhattad is currently showcasing various aspects of agricultural concerns at an art residency organized by Foundation of Indian Contemporary Art at New Delhi. _line_"FICA gives a public art grant which I received last year in December to organize a Land Art Festival. They invited me for a solo show in Delhi this month to show what we had done with the grant. Since it was about the work done under our Gram project, I decided that all those connected should also come along," says Shweta who opened the show on July 13 with her performance._line_ Her act titled \'Barren Orgasm\' was designed to highlight the harms caused by BT cotton, GM crops, extensive use of chemical fertilizer and loss of land which will lead to destruction of farming. Slathered with mud, which the group carried from a pond they have built in their village, Bhattad sat on a raised structure with a chastity belt tied around her waist. _line_"There was a video titled \'Vagina Vomit\' which was placed over the chastity belt. It showed chemical fertilizers, imported seeds, BT cotton, GM crops being vomited out. We also added the sounds made while vomiting to it," she explains._line_A red cloth tied to the chastity belt was spread through the room and ran into the next one. "The visitors walked in on that red carpet and reached where I was sitting to watch the video. It conveyed that what appears very welcoming first is actually a deadly trap," says Bhattad._line_Bhattad\'s sibling Aditi, who too is an artist, also did a performance titled \'Are you Nero\'s Guest\'. In it, she wore a nine-yard sari and sat writing the names, age and date of demise of farmers who had committed suicide over the last three years. _line_"The total figure of dead farmers was on her back which she had created by tanning herself. The postcards made with seed paper where handed over to the visitors," says the artist. _line_There were empty wooden frames on the walls below which drawers were placed. Details of various works done by the Gram residency were kept in the drawers that were made at \'Maker\'s Adda\' in Nagpur. _line_"We displayed pictures and details of seven paintings in fields for which social workers, artists and farmers had collaborated at the Land Art Festival held at Paradsinga in December last year. Seeds of lal bhaji, spinach and fenugreek were sowed to grow motifs which depicted farmers\' issues," says Bhattad._line_A \'rakhi\' workshop was also organized at Delhi which was conducted by two village women from Paradsinga. "The rakhis are made with indigenous Indian cotton. We procure the cotton from Akola, it is spun and dyed with natural colours in Wardha and rakhis are made in Paradsinga.

"I was born in India, and brought up in The Midlands, an industrial region of England. I know the feeling of belonging nowhere. People find it easy to box you. So, as a woman of Asian origin, I was viewed as a passive person, who cannot achieve much. And then I came to head this theatre company," says Thiarai, about the inspiration behind Sisters. "Instead of doing a retrospective on themes like Partition, we decided to explore the lives of women, and how history has shaped us all."_line_Sameera Iyengar, artistic lead of the theatre and arts movement, Junoon, agrees over the need to challenge assumed frameworks. "What we need is an act of imagination, rooted in varied perspectives, which is why, we wanted generational diversity, and diversity of language and practice among the artistes. Sushama Deshpande, for instance, has worked with tamasha and lavani performers, while Choiti Ghosh works in different languages and brings a perspective beyond Mumbai," she says._line_One more workshop is lined up for October.

S' GRENOBLE: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said. _line_  Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday. _line_  "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg. _line_ In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. _line_ Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people. _line_ Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. _line_ Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts. _line_ "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. _line_ "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". _line_ Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps. _line_ A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. _line_'

S"It's not income, but it can still make or break your business._line_As an entrepreneur, there are plenty of metrics, numbers and ideas that you have to monitor, track, and keep an eye on both the day-to-day side. One of the most important aspects of managing a business is net income._line_Income is one of the first metrics and data points that every entrepreneur learns about, either in business school or from work experience, and clearly occupies the majority of management time. There's a host of other areas that entrepreneurs, especially Millennial entrepreneurs, focus on when developing a business idea (like sustainability or customer service). All of these ideas require net income to bring them from concept to reality._line_Income is clearly important and the calculation is relatively straightforward (revenues minus costs)--but there's another financial metric that is arguably more important for small businesses._line_Cash flow is an idea that, if you think back to your Accounting 101 class, might seem to be a lot like net income, and this even applies to how cash flows are presented and analyzed. Both metrics apply to a certain period of time, have several different components, and measure certain inflows and outflows of funds through your business._line_Even with these similarities, there is one particular fact that is critically important to keep in mind as you compare net income to cash flows as you manage and grow your business--they aren't the same. The specifics of cash flow analysis, measurement, and comparison between net income and cash flow are numerous enough to occupy an entire book (or class)._line_Don't worry, we won't go through all of them!_line_Let's take a look at a few of most important differences, facts, and items to keep in mind as you compare your net income and cash flow for your business. As always, be sure to work with your CPA or other financial professional familiar with both your business and financial goals before making any changes or strategic decisions._line_1. Net income and cash flow are not the same._line_One of the most common misconceptions that I see as a CPA working with entrepreneurs and small business owners is that people see net income and cash flow as the same thing. This couldn't be further from the truth._line_For example, while accounts payable (bills you owe) and accounts receivable (payments you are due) play an important role in calculating net income and other financial statements, the changes in the accounts and items truly influence cash flow._line_2. Bills cannot be paid with net income._line_Net income, as you and I both know, is one of the most important financial metrics that you have to monitor, but you cannot pay bills with net income. Your suppliers, partners, other vendors, and employees need to be paid with actual cash flows._line_You like getting paid in cash (actual currency), correct? Keeping an eye on the cash inflows and outflows of your business enables you to pay your bills, grow your business, and develop new business ideas._line_3. You can figure out your cash flow starting with your income._line_Net income and cash flow are different, but they are related, so let's take a quick look at an example of calculating your cash from your net income._line_Your business starts off with reported income of $1,000, and the following information is available. Your accounts receivable increased by $200 during the month, and your accounts payable increased by $500 during this month._line_So, taking a step back to analyze the performance of your firm on a cash flow basis you start with your net income of $1,000, subtract the increased in accounts receivable ,since you are owed this money but have not yet been paid. Then, you add the $500 increase to your accounts payable since, although you have incurred these services, you have not yet paid for them._line_Long story short, your income for the period in question is $1,000, but your cash flow for the same period is $1,000 - $200 + $500, or $1,300._line_Applying these differences across organizations of different sizes and you can quickly see just how important understanding the differences between net income and cash flow truly are. Cash flow truly represents the lifeblood of how business operates, pays its bills, and continues to grow it operations, so it's critically important for every entrepreneur to understand these differences._line_It may sound complicated or abstract, but it is not all that complex, and gaining a better understanding of these concepts will help you manage your business more effectively._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_"

S"Zeng was born in the city of Wuhan in central China in 1964, the son of laborers from a printing factory. The lower social status of his family allowed them to survive relatively unscathed through the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution during which time many of the country\xe2\x80\x99s intellectuals and professionals were executed. His mother, however, was often persecuted for her fondness for colorful clothing and publicly shamed by the Red Guards, who left abusive graffiti outside her place of work and family home. The changes rippling through China left no demographic untouched. _line_Zeng showed promise as an artist at an early age, illustrating in his notebooks to break the tedium of the new Maoist syllabus. He neglected every subject other than art, refusing to study anything that did not engage him creatively. Eventually he dropped out of high school in 1980 to work at a printing factory and took painting lessons privately in his free time. He first applied to the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts in 1982 but failed to gain entry due to his poor performance in math and science. Undaunted, he took the entrance exam five years in a row and was finally admitted to the university in 1987. _line_During this time he became enamored of German Expressionism, the style that would inform his later work. Upon graduating from university, Zeng gained immediate critical acclaim with \xe2\x80\x9cHospital Triptych No. 1\xe2\x80\x9d, a study of the distress and horror he encountered during daily visits to a neighborhood sanatorium._line_Rise to Fame_line_The government assigned him a job at an incipient advertising firm in 1991, and with the help of David Ogilvy\xe2\x80\x99s manuals, he achieved a relative amount of financial stability. After the celebrated art collector Johnson Chang bought his first paintings in 1993 for $2000 each, Zeng moved to Beijing in search of a more dynamic environment._line_Leaving Wuhan was difficult for the artist, who missed the familiarity of known faces and found himself psychologically alienated from his peers. His work from this period displays an array of aesthetic styles and motifs as he searched for the idiom that best expressed his rich inner world. He began work on his Mask series in 1994 in an attempt to exorcise the overpowering sense of isolation he felt. The paintings feature chic figures in expressionless white masks, alluding to the superficial transformation of 1990s China. The environment in which he placed these figures were equally unreal, a reference to the artificiality inherent in a culture attempting to transform its identity. _line_The New Millennium_line_The Mask series propelled Zeng to international stardom and earned him millions of dollars in sales. Since 2000, he has participated in over forty group shows and had solo exhibitions in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Korea, London, Paris and New York. In 2002, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Supper\xe2\x80\x9d sold for over $23 million dollars at an auction, cementing his position as one of the wealthiest artists in Asia. _line_He continues to experiment with different styles, a loose reflection of the development of the Chinese art market.

You can't get those on the Carrera or Targa S._line_ Our model has just a couple of options, including four-wheel steering and that Carmine Red paint. While the turbos have quieted the exhaust note slightly, the sound itself is as good as ever. Possibly the best bit about this particular car is that the 3.0-liter flat-six sends all 450 horsepower through a seven-speed manual transmission._line_Editor-in-Chief Greg Migliore: There's a scene in a old spy movie where Robert Redford slips on a pair of aviators, gets behind the wheel of an old 911, and pulls out of a parking garage after quitting the CIA. At least on the big screen, it seems like a great release. That's how it feels to drive the 911 GTS. In this age of Demons, AMGs, and awesome power available at almost any price point, it's easy to forget how good the 911 is._line_ I found myself staring at its curves and proportions one early morning as I sipped black coffee and watched my dog eat her breakfast. Carmine Red with black wheels is one of the Top 3 ways I'd consider speccing out my 911, if I were ever to get one (I'd keep the black wheels but might opt for gray or green body paint)._line_ The powertrain is brilliant. It sounds good. It's powerful but not insane. The seven-speed manual is a lot of fun. It's precise and engaging. I didn't need seven gears for suburban cruising, but it's certainly a sophisticated setup. The steering offers a similarly focused vibe. As we've reported, the GTS is a compelling proposition of enthusiasts. You get a lot of stuff you want. I've always leaned toward the 718 Cayman or Boxster models, but I'm really starting to fall for the 911._line_Awesome night in the @Porsche 911 GTS. Seven-speed manual and flat six. #catharsis. pic.twitter.com/WDznWYG2ze_line_ \xe2\x80\x94 Greg Migliore (@GregMigliore) July 25, 2017 _line_Senior Editor, Green John Beltz Synder: When a car has six figures in its MSRP, any fantasy I might have entertained of me owning that car withers and dies. I blow that dream a kiss and move on. No big deal._line_ But when I drove the Porsche 911 GTS home this week, I had to mourn the fantasy. Driving this car, I was genuinely heavyhearted to know that I'd never walk into a Porsche dealership and purchase a 911. This moment, enjoying the mechanical precision of the seven-speed manual transmission and feeling the breathy shove of the (flat!) turbo six behind me, was ephemeral. I tried to console myself with an old adage, but got it twisted:_line_The best things in life are ... well, pretty expensive actually. @therealautoblog pic.twitter.com/t5Q967WcLz_line_ \xe2\x80\x94 John Beltz Snyder (@jbeltzsnyder) July 26, 2017 _line_ As I darted through traffic, played with the 911's weight around corners, and generally soaked up all the knowledge and feedback this car willingly imparts, I got to thinking: the second-best things in life are usually a lot cheaper._line_ A Mazda Miata is much more accessible. That car brings me almost as much joy. It'll never be as special or powerful as a Porsche 911, but it's a pretty distilled driving experience, offering an intimate connection with something balanced and pure. It even has similar bulges on the edges of the hood directing the pilot's gaze forward to the next bend in the road. That always gets me._line_ I realize that the 911 starts under $100k (but still out of reach), and that used 911s (and brand new Caymans) are even more affordable. Still, driving this German car reinforces my more realistic urge to own a Japanese car inspired by British ones._line_Associate Editor Reese Counts: The driving position in this car is damn near perfect. From the steering wheel to the pedal placement to the seven-speed shifter, everything is right where you want it to be. Because everything is where you need it, there's a directness to every action that few cars can match. The shifter moves with precision. The action on the accelerator seems to feed the smallest inputs straight to the rear. The steering is light but always lets you know what the front tires are doing. On a good road, this car is intoxicating._line_Oh, I've been itching to get my hands on you. #porsche #porsche911 #911 #911carrera #911carreragts #carminered #manualtransmission_line_A post shared by Reese Counts (@rmcounts) on Jul 27, 2017 at 7:37pm PDT_line_ I can't speak much to the old naturally aspirated flat-six engines of yesteryear, but this 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine is a peach. Torque comes on low and heavy. Revs build to a winding 7,500 crescendo, spitting and cracking as you move up through gears. The engine sounds like a dream, and the not-so-subtle turbo whine reminds you what's cooking out back. Even with the turbos, power is smooth and linear, with just the smallest amount of lag at low revs._line_ The more cars I drive, the less I'm concerned about flat-out acceleration and top speed. Yes, there are cars that cost less than half as much that will equal or outperform the 911 Carrera GTS on a track. I don't care. None of them provide the pure, visceral pleasure that this car does. Everything, from the looks to the noise to the way it moves, makes me want more._line_"

S'Old Hollywood Inspired Master Bathroom With Custom Mahogany Cabinets_line_When renovating a 1920s house steeped in history, where does one begin? Designer Scott Thomas says understanding a space and its needs is step one \xe2\x80\x93 something that can\xe2\x80\x99t be done without getting to know the home and its owners._line_Empty-nesters Alan and Lisa Stern wanted to update their Paul Revere Williams-designed Los Angeles home. Williams, best known for his work on the L.A. International Airport and Beverly Hills Hotel, designed homes for many famous Hollywood stars, and part of Lisa Stern\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the home was to add some of that old Hollywood glamour to it._line_The Stern\xe2\x80\x99s home, built in 1929, originally belonged to director and filmmaker Billy Wilder, whose work on films such as Some Like it Hot, The Apartment and Sunset Blvd. also served as inspiration during the remodeling project. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean can you imagine the people who sat at the bar here? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do old Hollywood glamor?\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas recalls._line_As Art Deco fans, the Sterns wanted to maintain the existing design elements in the architecture while cultivating a clean and luxurious look in every room. Thomas made thoughtful updates while preserving the home\xe2\x80\x99s footprint and character. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it to look like it should have been that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he says._line_That process shines in the master bathroom. From the textured, mirrored wall to the custom mahogany cabinets, every element was crucial to building the old Hollywood feel. A vintage style shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exclude updated necessities, though. Thomas added marble floors and countertops, a walk-in shower with a skylight, and custom wallpaper._line_Thomas believes that \xe2\x80\x9csimplicity creates serenity,\xe2\x80\x9d evident in his master bedroom design. Wanting the room to be elegant but appropriate, he applied a hotel-style layout with luxurious accents. The bold curtains, Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s favorite feature in the room, are an elegant way to divide the rooms while adding a sense of drama to the quiet space._line_In the conservatory, Thomas wanted to keep the look masculine while continuing to honor the home\xe2\x80\x99s history, so he kept the original brick on the side of the house in place. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is supposed to be my version of a man cave,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have some shine, and we have some books and brick, and to me it kind of screams boy time.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_To re-create the energy and serenity found in the Wilder home and all of Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s projects, the designer suggests focusing on fabrics, colors and quality materials while keeping the style clean and simple. \xe2\x80\x9cYou take the elements. You need patterns and textures and shine,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThrow in one good pattern and use a complementary color scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_'

S'Minka Kelly made headlines recently when it was revealed that she has been quietly dating Grey\'s Anatomy star Jesse Williams "for a few months." While 37-year-old Minka, who is most known for her roles on Friday Night Lights and Parenthood, is no stranger to dating high-profile men, her relationship with Jesse garnered attention due to the fact that he may have been married when the two began seeing each other \xe2\x80\x94 Jesse split from his longtime wife, Aryn Drake-Lee, in April and rumors have since swirled that infidelity played a part in their breakup (which Jesse has denied)._line_Either way, it certainly seems as though Minka has found love with the actor, who she first met while starring together in The Butler back in 2013. But before Jesse came along, there were a handful of famous suitors who captured Minka\'s heart, including a sitcom star, professional athlete, and Captain America himself._line_ 1.

Chris Evans _line_Minka and Chris first struck up a romance in 2007 and suffered a series of breakups and makeups for the next seven years. The last time they were rumored to be back together was in September 2015, after being spotted together over Labor Day Weekend._line_ 5. John Mayer _line_After calling it quits with Jessica Simpson in late 2007, the singer started dating Minka. They split in January 2008, though People reported that they were "still friends" despite the split._line_ 6. Topher Grace _line_Minka was rumored to have a fling with the That \'70s Show star in 2008._line_ 7. Derek Jeter _line_One of Minka\'s most high-profile relationships was with NY Yankees star Derek Jeter, whom she dated from May 2008 to August 2011._line_ 8. Ram\xc3\xb3n Rodr\xc3\xadguez _line_After splitting from Derek Jeter, Minka was rumored to be hooking up with actor Ram\xc3\xb3n Rodr\xc3\xadguez, her costar on the short-lived Charlie\'s Angels TV reboot in 2011._line_ 9. Wilmer Valderrama _line_Minka dated Wilmer Valderrama in 2012, but the relationship didn\'t last long.

Despite the timing, Jesse has addressed reports of infidelity on his part. In an 11-minute Tidal video, Footnotes for 4:44, for JAY-Z\'s latest album, he says, "I was in a relationship 13 years \xe2\x80\x9413 real years, not five years, not seven years, 13 years. And all of a sudden motherf*ckers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship. Like, the most painful experience I\'ve had in my life \xe2\x80\x94 like with a person I\'ve loved with all of my heart \xe2\x80\x94 that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute."

S'Don\'t overlook the big reason behind their incredible success._line_CREDIT: Getty Images_line_When you look at the most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs, it\'s easy to focus on the outward symbols of their success--acquisitions, IPOs, or titles, for example. Yet it is their internal achievement--the development of a growth mindset--that is really their greatest driver of success._line_One of the biggest factors for sustainable achievement is a growth mindset that values learning. Icons like Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, Arianna Huffington, and Bill Gates are always finding ways to learn new things and grow as people._line_It\'s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you don\'t have enough time to learn, but that\'s simply not true. You have the same amount of time in your day as Oprah; you just need to find ways to fit learning into your busy schedule._line_Here are eight easy ways to keep learning and growing, no matter how busy you may be._line_Read books_line_There\'s a reason why Bill Gates, Oprah, and Mark Zuckerberg make reading such a big priority. We are significantly shaped by the stories we read and the information we absorb._line_Find books that feed your curiosities or speak to specific skills. Allow biographies to inspire and novels to spur your imagination. Reading provides new knowledge, fresh perspectives, and a playful imagination that can carry over into all parts of you life. Audiobooks make this easier than ever._line_Listen to a podcast_line_It\'s amazing how much you can learn--both in terms of breadth and depth--by listening to a podcast._line_Podcasts are a dream for the busy entrepreneur, as you can listen to them in short sessions when you have 10 or 15 minutes to spare. I always listen to a podcast while I\'m traveling for business--making use of the time that is wasted while waiting at the airport._line_Spend time with different people_line_You should always be meeting others who have skills, knowledge, and experiences that differ from your own. Break away from your industry or CEO groups and start hanging out with high performers in other industries or professions. Interacting with artists and professionals from other industries has been a source of inspiration that broadens my perspective--and it can do the same for you._line_Travel_line_You\'ll learn as much about yourself as you will about others when you take time to travel the world. Exposure to new scenery, cuisines, languages, and cultures forces you to learn new things and observe the way others live._line_You don\'t need to wait for a vacation to benefit from travel. On your next business trip, make the time to explore a new neighborhood or interact with locals._line_TED Talks_line_In 18 minutes or less, some of the world\'s brightest thinkers share cutting-edge discoveries, innovative research, and inspiring stories. A single TED Talk can forever shape your perspective. Download the TED app to find new talks and save your favorites._line_Find time to think_line_A few years ago, I decided to drive in silence instead of listening to a podcast or audiobook. After a few minutes, I experienced multiple epiphanies._line_That day, I learned that you need to give your brain a break in order to process the information that is constantly coming in. Silence gives you the opportunity to develop original ideas and sort out all of the thoughts jumbled up in your head._line_Ignore the people who tell you to "always be hustling." Find and protect the time you need to reflect and think. Meditating is a great way to do this. Walking, hiking, and spending time in nature are other great ways to experience a more reflective environment._line_Work with a mentor_line_No one has it all figured out, but there are many who can offer you wisdom and advice. Find someone who is further down life\'s path or deeper into his or her career and ask them to share from their knowledge and experience. You\'ll gain confidence and assurance, and learn more than you could on your own._line_Learn a new sport or physical activity_line_Get out of your mind and connect with your body by learning a new form of exercise. Not only will physical activity keep you healthy, but the process of learning something from scratch will give you new skills you can take into your work._line_When I learned how to box, it gave me a renewed sense of patience and improvisation. It also taught me the balance between offense and defense--which is information I regularly use when negotiating or working with others._line_Conclusion_line_Many of the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders live with a growth mindset. They view learning as a necessary and regular activity that contributes to their personal growth and professional success. Make learning a constant in your life and adopt some of these recommendations. Growth never becomes obsolete._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_'

Now though, something lot more powerful, a lot greener and a lot meaner is coming to town. The AMG GT-R is likely to be launched in the country soon and while the date is not confirmed, some images that cropped up on social media suggest that the first unit has arrived in India. The car in the image, posted by AutomobiliArdent: Petrolhead Lifestyle has the signature \xe2\x80\x98Green Hell Magno\xe2\x80\x99 paint job.

S'Consumer behavior studies are embracing virtual reality to decrease costs and boost accuracy. _line_Lately, we keep hearing about the impact of virtual reality (VR) on shopping and retail. Whether it\'s a VR fashion show or virtual changing rooms, or even the world\'s first virtual reality department store, VR is enjoying a wild ride at the moment._line_But far less is known about how VR is changing retail shopping behind the scenes. Forward-thinking businesses are using VR today to improve "shopability" and glean insights on shopper behaviors and needs. This kind of data crunching may not be VR\'s most glamorous application, but it\'s certainly proving effective. In fact, 74 percent of retailers say they\'ll lean on VR in the coming years to improve customer experience and gather data. It\'s already clear that there\'s a huge opportunity for businesses to use VR to improve the shopping journey before their customers even reach their store._line_Chicago-based VR company InContext Solutions is in the forefront of VR innovators for retail business. Recently closing out a $15.2 million funding round led by Intel Capital and Beringea -- and with a roster of the world\'s largest brands and retailers, including Nestle, Smucker\'s, Kellogg\'s, Anheuser-Busch, and Walgreens -- InContext\'s cloud-based VR software is helping revolutionize the B-to-B retail space. Their enterprise VR software gives retailers and brands the tools they need to evaluate ideas before taking anything to market._line_As Tracey Wiedmeyer, Chief Technology Officer at InContext explains: "By building hyper-realistic 3D virtual simulations for in-store testing, VR is enabling retailers and brand managers to make faster, smarter and more profitable decisions on how they market both their products and their stores."_line_Reshaping Market Research_line_The world of retail has always revolved around knowing your shopper. What products are they looking for? What grabs their attention? Traditionally, this type of market research is done through focus groups, purchase intent surveys and shopalongs -- all of which are either time-consuming or don\'t necessarily reflect actual shopper behavior. VR allows retailers and manufacturers to conduct shopping simulations and follow-up surveys to learn behavioral and attitudinal data in near-real time._line_"VR allows retailers and brand managers to test new product assortments, aisle configurations, advertising, and signage. Through virtual shopping exercises, we learn about shopper behaviors and see which concepts will create the greatest engagement," says Wiedmeyer._line_Fewer "Hunch-based" Decisions_line_With VR, making decisions on gut instinct alone is a thing of the past. New concepts can be designed, tested and presented in a VR environment before requiring a physical prototype, thereby eliminating a great deal of the financial risk associated with presenting something new._line_"The smartest retailers and brands are using VR to carefully curate their products, researching what will return the most success before placing anything on the shelves," Wiedmeyer explains._line_Large and small CPG companies alike can benefit from VR\'s ability to move faster and be more affordable than traditional market research methods, giving them the luxury of actually knowing which of their concepts will work before allocating financial and material resources._line_Brand and Retailer Collaboration_line_VR streamlines the communication and execution process for rolling out a new store design or product placement by providing a collaborative platform between teams. No wonder that the VR market is projected to reach more than $120B by 2020. Brands and retailers who aren\'t already collaborating via VR should strongly consider the switch, as VR is quickly becoming a vital tool._line_"A category team can ideate the best placement for a new product, and send the concept to the shopper marketing team that can see notes and add relevant signage," says Wiedmeyer, "The entire concept can then be viewed by executives and retail partners who decide what should be tested further. VR eliminates the constant back and forth among specialist teams, and greatly reduces timelines, by streamlining the crucial collaboration process."_line_VR is already becoming a crowded space, with over 200 companies valued at $13B participating. VR allows users to create proven solutions while working faster and smarter than ever before. Today\'s forward-thinking retailers are peering through their VR headsets, driving new changes in the way we act as consumers, consider purchases and ultimately, shop._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_'

S'Luis Dias_line_Ever since the beginning of Child\xe2\x80\x99s Play India Foundation (www.childsplayindia.org), a music charity working to instil positive values and social empowerment to underprivileged children in India that is now in its seventh year, we are on the radar of young musicians worldwide who want to work in this sector._line_In December 2015, we were contacted by Abi Heath from England, a member of the Wind-Up Penguin Theatre Company, a children\xe2\x80\x99s musical theatre company, made up of a group of creative people, musicians, singers, actors and technicians from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), London. \xe2\x80\x9cWe come together to create pieces of children\xe2\x80\x99s musical theatre and then take our shows to developing countries, where we perform to children in schools, hospitals, orphanages and slums, or anywhere we can find them! We then work with the children, showing them the instruments and giving them the chance to experience live music, an opportunity many have never had before,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in her email to us. And about a week later I got a supporting email from our friend in London, Goan-origin pianist-pedagogue at Trinity Laban Karl Lutchmayer._line_Thus began a chain of correspondence that led to their performing for our Child\xe2\x80\x99s Play children in addition to other locations in Goa in August last year. The quality of their performance was so good that it seemed a shame that more children (and adults!) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the experience. So when the Wind-Up Theatre Company got in touch again this year regarding a return visit, I resolved to have their performance in a more public, larger venue. And so their performance will be at Caritas Conference Hall St Inez on July 31, 2017 at 6 p.m._line_I interviewed Elisabeth Swedlund for this article: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wind-Up Penguin theatre company was founded in 2012 by me and my classmate at the Guildhall School from Romania, Ioana Macovei-Vlascceanu. I\xe2\x80\x99d been running a summer camp for children in a very poor, very isolated village in Romania for the past 5 years, and had always profoundly wished to be able to bring something more artistic to children who lived in places where they have practically no access to culture, art, and multiculturalism \xe2\x80\x93 often in less affluent parts of the world. By fortunate coincidence, Ioana\xe2\x80\x99s parents run a school which is in contact with many charities, and they organised our whole first project \xe2\x80\x93 performing in hospitals, orphanages, and rural schools around Bucharest. The experience was life-changing for the nine students involved \xe2\x80\x93 we went back to Romania (with eight extra Guildhall students, so seventeen of us), the next winter. Our university \xe2\x80\x93 and therefore Penguin \xe2\x80\x93 is very international. During our second project, Bozhana, from Bulgaria, offered to organise a project in Bulgaria \xe2\x80\x93 same with Carlos, our Colombian friend. Once we\xe2\x80\x99d realised it was relatively easy, in this day and age of internet communication, to arrange performances around the world, we started to extrapolate to countries we really wanted to work/perform in. Five years later, after 13 projects, and over 10000 children performed to in more than 150 different places, we\xe2\x80\x99re still going strong!\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The Wind-Up Penguin theatre company has so far visited Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Lebanon, India, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. They create professional-standard musical theatre performances which they have then taken into refugee camps in Europe resulting from the current crisis in the Middle East, and to hospitals, schools, orphanages and special needs centres in the countries they have visited._line_Swedlund talks in particular about the children in the refugee camps: \xe2\x80\x9cWe very much can tell that the refugee children we perform to have witnessed violence and severe insecurity. They have extraordinarily high energies, and often people who work with them find it difficult to get them to learn, understand, behave. Artistic experiences, I feel, are crucial at this point: in our workshops, we use games and music/singing to channel children\xe2\x80\x99s energy, enabling them to run, shout, play, in a safe space, all through being creative (which they often very much are).\xe2\x80\x9d_line_Any experiences that stand out it Swedlund\xe2\x80\x99s memory? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xbave had so many! At the time of this interview, we were performing in Victoria Square, a Square in Athens where many Syrian children play with their parents. A few children ran up to us and asked us about \xe2\x80\x98the boy\xe2\x80\x99 (the puppet we\xe2\x80\x99d been performing with in our previous show). They also remembered ALL of the songs we\xe2\x80\x99d taught them three months ago. It very much reminded me that, what I sometimes feel might be a \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 performance, can inspire children and stay with them, hopefully, in difficult moments.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The troupe also has this endorsement from the Head of Music at the Guildhall School, Jonathan Vaughan: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wind-Up Penguin are a group of highly motivated students who are really interested in charity work. They produce really dazzling and colourful productions to entertain children throughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_How does Wind-Up Penguin choose its members? Swedlund explained \xe2\x80\x9cAs the founder, for me, Penguin combines two equally important aspects: to bring professional-quality music and theatre to children in parts of the world where they don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to art, and to inspire music and drama students to use their skills and training in an altruistic and world-focused way. We specifically advertise our projects to students from the Guildhall School and a few other performance universities of similar high level around London. The project leader (often myself) interviews the members \xe2\x80\x93 we make no distinction artistically, as we know that anyone studying in these universities automatically has a high musical/theatrical level. What we mainly look for is an interest and enthusiasm about discovering the world and helping others through art, and a willingness to work and live alongside a group of other eccentric artists for a couple of weeks!\xe2\x80\x9d_line_At their performance tour of India in July-August, last year, in addition to Goa, the Wind-Up theatre company also visited Mumbai, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Tiruvannamalai and Chennai, logging in 31 shows and theatre workshops to over 5000 children._line_So what will their performance involve? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a cross arts show, incorporating a cappella singing, musicians, comedy theatre, balloons and puppets. It\xe2\x80\x99s very interactive with the kids. All colourful and fun.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, Penguin is about inspiring artists, who often are on their way to a highly successful career, to perform with an altruistic view on the world. And of course \xe2\x80\x93 for children, through music, theatre, and laughter, to get inspiring, very much out-of-the-ordinary, and hopefully memorable experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d says Swedlund._line_'

S"From Monday to Friday, our hectic daily work schedule does not leave us with any time to pay extra attention to our skin and hair. Now, when the weekend comes, there is some extra time in hand and that can definitely be spent on taking care of the beauty requirements of the body._line_Beauty requirements of the body include taking care of both the hair and skin. It is during the weekends that you can try to do all possible skin and hair beauty treatments, such that by Monday you end up looking fabulous and throughout the week, you don't put on a dull look._line_So that you can use well all the extra time that you get during the weekend in properly taking care of yourself, here is a list of skin and hair care to-dos that you must try to add in your weekend routine. Doing these skin and hair beauty treatments during the weekend will let you look your best during the entire week. So, go ahead and take a look._line_Skin Exfoliation_line_Skin exfoliation is not an everyday activity. Yet, you should be regular in exfoliating your skin. Skin exfoliation takes time and during weekdays, you might not invest so much in doing that. During weekends, how about using the time to exfoliate your skin with a gentle scrubber? You can use mild scrubber from the nearest beauty shop or prepare one homemade scrubber to do this._line_Salon Time_line_The hectic weekdays do not allow us to land up in the salon or spend time there. So, how about booking an appointment during the weekend? Some skin and hair pampering at the salon during the weekend will revitalize you for the coming week. In the salon, you can go for treatments and services, depending on the present condition of your skin and hair._line_Hair Massage And Masks_line_Weekdays are all about those quick hair wash sessions right before going to work. Your hair needs much more than that. So on the weekend, use the extra time in hand for some good hair massage and follow this by applying a good hair mask. This is not only pampering but it makes your hair ready to bear all the dust and pollution, yet not give up during the week._line_Milk Bath_line_How about a special bath during the weekend? Preparing milk bath is really special during weekends if you have all the right ingredients. Along with milk, you will need some honey, rose petal and Epsom salt. Going for a milk bath is rejuvenating for your entire body. Ensure you let your body enjoy and feel the milk all over and do not rush in that process._line_Body Massage or Spa_line_The constant hecatombs of the week make the body tired and fatigued. Get over the pain, with a body spa or body massage. You can schedule your body spa or massage at the salon. These days, professionals also come home to deliver such services right at your doorstep. Doing this prepares you for the coming week and is also very relaxing._line_Nail Care_line_Now, during the weekend, when you are spending time on the skin and hair, how about spending some time on your nails as well? Men can clean the nails, trim them, file them and also go for some pedicure and manicure sessions. Along with pedicure and manicure, women can plan a good nail colour or nail art that they can carry all along the week. This will also remove existing dirt and dust on your nails, making it feel clean._line_Eye Care_line_Eyes are indeed soft and a special part of the body. Its beauty routine is very different from all your body parts. Eye care, during the weekend, is especially important for those with dark circles or eye bags. While doing this, ensure you use ophthalmologist-verified products alone._line_"

S'Back in April, singer Michelle Branch came out with "Hopeless Romantic," her third full-length studio record. It\'s the first album she\'s released since "Hotel Paper" in 2003. The time away from the radio public inspired magazine headlines like "What Happened to Michelle Branch?" upon her return._line_The new record was co-produced and co-written with Patrick Carney of the Black Keys, Branch\'s boyfriend, who helped Branch zero in on a dusky synth-pop feel. (Carney plays in Branch\'s touring band as well.) There\'s a new-wave gene that\'s expressing itself on Branch\'s latest. But Branch throws in some tender balladry, too. The record is about losing and finding love and growing up. Branch, who had her first hit with "Everywhere" in 2001, had considered quitting music over the past 10 years because of being caught in label limbo, among other things. She grew up as a teen-pop star, and she\'s got a child now and been through a divorce._line_She\'s matured a bit and she\'s ready for her music to be a more accurate reflection of her life experience and her own voice than to have it be some focus-grouped pop confection. Another side benefit of sitting on the sidelines for a dozen years or so: Branch had a ton of material to choose from for the new record._line_Michelle Branch performs at College Street Music Hall, 238 College St., New Haven, Saturday, Aug. 5, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $25 to $27. collegestreetmusichall.com_line_'

S'Reported by :_line_Xiaomi\xe2\x80\x99s Redmi range of smartphones has become a de-facto option for most of the users in India. At the start of the year, Xiaomi said that they would launch Mi smartphones in India, along with the Redmi series. And here comes the first Mi smartphone- the Mi Max 2, which is the successor to last year\xe2\x80\x99s Mi Max._line_The Mi Max 2 comes with a 6.44-inch display; one might wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s going to buy a 6.44-inch smartphone, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bezel-less display. But note this point, Xiaomi has sold over 3 million units of Mi Max since its launch last year, which is the only reason for the company to launch its successor._line_Furthermore, Xiaomi also said that the Mi Max became the best selling smartphone in the 6-inch or bigger display smartphone category. That said, the Mi Max was considered as a larger variant of the Redmi Note 3 because it used the same hardware, camera setup and had a bigger display and battery._line_However, the Mi Max 2 is not a bigger variant of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Redmi Note 4. Even though the Mi Max 2 uses the same chipset, the amount of RAM & storage and the device has some unique features of its own. I spent a day with the Xiaomi\xe2\x80\x99s latest phablet, the Mi Max 2. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my account of the same._line_Design and Display_line_One unique feature of the Mi Max 2 is its design. Xiaomi has changed the entire design language of the Mi Max 2 from the Redmi 4 series. The antenna bands are now present at the top and bottom of the device, same as the Apple iPhone 7 and Oppo R11. Also, the Chinese company launched only the matte black colour option in India, which is a good move because consumers in India went crazy about the matte black versions of the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4._line_The design is distinct and one thing which I noticed immediately after taking the device into my hands how sleek it is. The Mi Max 2 have a larger battery, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the Xiaomi engineers away from building a slimmer handset. The Mi Max 2 measures just 7.6mm in thickness and weighs 211grams, but the weight is evenly distributed, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel like holding a smartphone of above 200grams._line_The Mi Max 2 uses the same 6.44-inch Full HD display as the Mi Max, but the brightness levels have increased by a significant margin. This time around, Xiaomi has announced that the display is protected by the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 technology. The screen looked decent in the short time I spent with the device._line_Hardware_line_As said earlier, the hardware of the Mi Max 2 is similar to the Redmi Note 4. The device uses the 2.0GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The storage is expandable up to 256GB with the help of a microSD card._line_The device performed well and was quick in opening the system apps. However, the Snapdragon 625 might struggle with intensive use and the app load time is something the chipset disappointed users in the past. We will test the performance of the phone in coming days and will come out with a full verdict in the review._line_Camera_line_Another aspect where the Mi Max 2 excels is the camera. Xiaomi has used the 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor, same as the Xiaomi Mi 6\xe2\x80\x99s primary sensor. The sensor has an aperture of f/2.2, dual LED flash, and can record 4K videos as well. Here are a few camera samples shot with the Mi Max 2._line_The disappointing note, however, is that the phone still has a 5MP front-facing camera, which is a bummer._line_Battery_line_Coming to the battery, the Mi Max 2 has a 5300mAh unit with support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and Parallel Charge technology. Xiaomi claims a complete day battery life with an hour charge or to be precise 68 percent charge with an hour charge._line_Also, the Mi Max 2 beats the Nokia 3310 in the standby time segment because it is claimed to offer astounding 57 hours of standby time._line_Conclusion_line_Almost every brand in India is going after the selfie trend, but Xiaomi is just looking for price-to-specs ratio, and the Mi Max 2 follows the same motto. The 6.44-inch phablet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer a groundbreaking selfie camera, high-end hardware, nor a top-notch display, but it offers insane hardware for the asking price of Rs. 16,999._line_We will come up with over full review of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 in coming days. Let us know if you want to cover us any specific segment in the device by commenting below._line_'

We\'ll again request the IAF helicopter to pursue them and rescue them," he said. _line_ The flood situation in Ghatal had worsened, another official at the state secretariat said on the condition of anonymity. _line_ The state government is yet to estimate the loss incurred by the farmers as over 2.5 lakh hectares of agricultural land were submerged, sources said._line_(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)_line_'

S'A diet high in processed plant-based foods has been linked to a greater risk of heart disease. _line_This content originally appeared on Health._line_As a nutritionist, plant-based diets have been one of my areas of specialty for well over a decade. So I am thrilled that more and more people are interested in this way of eating, even on a part-time basis. But I am also concerned about the trend toward highly processed plant-based foods._line_These are foods that have been stripped of important nutrients, or formulated with unwanted additives. (Think snack chips, sugary cereals, and fake bacon.) They are everywhere, and it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly easy to eat a lot of them\xe2\x80\x94which won\xe2\x80\x99t protect your health, and could actually harm it._line_In fact, new research suggests that these plant-based junk foods may actually raise a person\xe2\x80\x99s risk of heart disease. The study, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at data from more than 200,000 people to analyze links between diet and heart health._line_The researchers found that adhering to a plant-based diet was associated with a lower risk of heart disease. But the type of plant foods mattered\xe2\x80\x94a lot._line_When the researchers broke down plant-based diets further, they discovered an important difference: While high intake of whole plant-based foods was linked to lower risk of heart disease; a high intake of processed plant-based foods was associated with a higher risk of heart disease. This negative impact was consistent when the researchers controlled for age, sex, BMI, and family history._line_The takeaway? Quality is king. To protect against heart disease\xe2\x80\x94which is the top killer of both men and women\xe2\x80\x94you should definitely reach for more plant-based foods, but make healthy choices a priority.

S'Albert Stumm, CNN \xe2\x80\xa2 Published 26th July 2017_line_(CNN) \xe2\x80\x94 Uniform rows of identical white headstones fill the green space in the small yards of mosques and churches throughout Sarajevo, each one bearing a date that seems too recent for a European war. _line_Only a few blocks outside the city center, some buildings are still pockmarked with bullet holes. _line_Reminders of the war that dissolved Yugoslavia are everywhere, but the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina is due for a fresh look as signs of a vibrant future begin to outshine those of the nearly four-year siege that devastated Sarajevo during the early 1990s. _line_New hotels add a measure of comfort to what has mostly been a backpacker destination, and five airlines announced new services to the city in the last year, including Qatar Airways and the budget carrier Wizz Air._line_Now the enigmatic city exudes a modern cool in numerous ways, such as a sculpture garden skate park in the restored Austro-Hungarian quarter and margaritas served in the preserved Ottoman bazaar within earshot of the Muslim call to prayer._line_Timothy Clancy, an American who came to Bosnia as a volunteer in 1992 and never left, said he\'s spent most of his adult life shining a positive light on a place that most travelers think of as a war-torn wasteland. _line_"One advantage is, people have low or no expectations," he says. "And Sarajevo drastically exceeds them every time."_line_Here are 11 things to do there: _line_1. See the Ottoman bazaar_line_The Ottoman bazaar boasts the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque. _line_The heart of Sarajevo, which was founded by the Ottomans in the 15th century, still lies in the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, a tight quarter of one-story market stalls that date to the city\'s earliest years._line_The market runs through a few car-free streets along the Miljacka River, leading up the wooden Sebilj fountain in a square teeming with pigeons. _line_Throughout the bazaar, exotic aromas of spice markets float among those of sizzling meats, sometimes a whole lamb spit-roasted in full view of passersby. Grizzled men in other stalls use metal tongs to pull searing copper from a fire and then hammer it into intricately designed plates, trays and goblets. _line_Some vendors veer closer to kitsch, selling cheap souvenirs and pens made from the shell casings of high-caliber rifles. Others stick with classics such as gooey Turkish delights, their gelatinous cubes redolent of fruit flavors and dusted in flour or coconut._line_The area also has the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and its lunar clock tower. The Hotel President, which opened in 2015 at the edge of the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, makes a good home base within sniffing distance of the action._line_Hotel President, +387 33 575-000, Bazard\xc5\xbeani 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_2. Savor a cultural pick-me-up_line_Younger Sarajevans enjoy meeting at hookah bars._line_There are dozens of places for an espresso or cappuccino in the old town, but it\'s worth searching out Bosnian coffee. _line_Thick, rich and strong as jet fuel, the local version is such a part of the culture that it\'s the drink of choice for everyone from courting couples to businessmen closing a deal. Visitors to a Bosnian\'s house will have coffee served whether they like or not._line_The coffee grounds are boiled with water in a long-handled copper pot on top of the stove, which most people associate with Turkish coffee. But the beans are generally roasted in Bosnia for a brew that\'s even more potent. _line_"It\'s 10 times better," Clancy says. "Turks are great at tea but not so much at coffee." _line_In the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, the Male Daire hookah bar, which is another activity enjoyed by younger Sarajevans, is a laid-back place to perk up and meet some friends. Or for a great people-watching corner, there\'s the sidewalk cafe outside Kaffa._line_Male Daire, +387 62 434 384, Luled\xc5\xbeina 6, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_Kaffa, +387 33 538-633, Sara\xc4\x8di 70, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_3. Take in a view from above _line_Work began in 1729 on five fortifications built onto the old city wall, but the \xc5\xbduta Tabija, or the Yellow Fortress, is basically all that\'s left. It looms above the city from Jekovac Cliff on the eastern end of the old town, offering a fantastic view and a spectacular place to see the sunset. _line_The red roofs and minarets of the old town give way to the neoclassical heft of an Austo-Hungarian expansion during the late 1800s, and eventually to the skyscrapers of the modern city in the distance. All of it is set against a backdrop of thick forested hills that surround Sarajevo. _line_A basic cafe opened in the fortress last year, with picnic tables that make the operation resemble a beer garden. Except no alcohol is served, and in the middle of the tables, a red velvet rope circles a cannon that\'s fired at sunset during the holy month of Ramadan. _line_Despite a few dry locations, the predominately Muslim city prides itself on its secular attitude, and you\'re much less likely to see a woman covering her hair than one click-clacking down the cobblestones in high heels._line_4. Go on one of the world\'s best hikes _line_Via Dinarica is a mega-network of paths that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia._line_All those hills surrounding Sarajevo lead to the mountains of the Dinaric Alps, which gave the city reason to host the Winter Olympics in 1984. Well-marked hiking trails wind through the woods on all sides of the city, meaning a hiker could walk out its eastern edge, head north and west along a ridge, and end up back on the other side of town that afternoon. _line_Those trails also lead to the Via Dinarica, a mega-network of paths inspired by the Appalachian Trail that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia. Along the way are traditional mountain villages and opportunities for rafting, hiking and climbing. _line_The network was named the best new trail of 2014 by Outside magazine and was on National Geographic Traveler\'s list of places to go in 2017. ViaDinarica.com is a comprehensive resource. _line_"You can print a miniguide for each section of the trail," says Clancy, who helped stitch the trial network together as an ecotourism consultant for the United Nations. "It\'ll show you where you the water holes are, can give you turn-by-turn directions. It\'s pretty sophisticated."_line_5. See where World War I began_line_The Latin Bridge, which crosses the shallow Miljacka River to connect the old town with the Skenderija neighborhood, is the city\'s oldest. But as 16th-century bridges go, the structure itself isn\'t what stands out. _line_On one end of this bridge in 1914, the heir to Hapsburg throne was assassinated by an 18-year-old Serbian, sparking World War I and leading to the extinction of two great empires, the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman. _line_A modest museum at the northern end of the bridge tells the story how Gavrip Princip happened to see Archduke Franz Ferdinand\'s motorcade after other would-be assassins failed to kill him. _line_The museum has changed with the evolving perception of Princip, who over the years has been seen as both a nationalist wing nut and a socialist hero. Now the museum focuses on the 40 years Sarajevo was ruled by Austria-Hungary, with particular attention for the end._line_Museum of Sarajevo 1878-1918, +387 33 533 288, Zelenih beretki 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_6. Dive into the steampunk and skater scene_line_Toward the west end of town, skateboarders shoot around the ramps at Hastahana Park while families linger on the grassy areas. When the sun starts going down on nice days, it can be a cool scene of young and old mingling together, some hanging out drinking beers while others watch the world go by._line_A gigantic sculpture by German artist Helmut Lutz, which was installed in 2005 next to one of the ramps, dominates the park. It\'s a steampunk mix of steel horns, fabric bellows and fanciful busts that looks like a yacht-sized musical instrument from Dr. Seuss\' Whoville. _line_The sculpture was funded by residents of one of Sarajevo\'s sister cities, the German town of Freiderichschafen. Each winter, the park also hosts a holiday market. _line_The neighborhood around the park exhibits the building boom during a massive expansion of the city during Austrian rule. Another Austrian contribution: the street car, which arrived in Sarajevo in 1885 as a test run for Vienna\'s public transit. _line_Hastahana Park, Mar\xc5\xa1ala Tita 12, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_7. Hike up to the abandoned Olympic bobsled track_line_The Olympic ruin is now a daredevils\' playground._line_When the Olympics came to Sarajevo, the games were hailed as a Cold War success in semi-neutral territory (Yugoslavia was communist but not aligned with the Soviet Union)._line_The war in the 1990s damaged many of the sporting venues, including the bobsled and luge track on Trebevi\xc4\x87 Mountain south of town. Despite some recent efforts to restore the track for training, it\'s basically abandoned and covered in graffiti._line_Videos abound on YouTube of people riding bikes or rollerblades down the track, but it also attracts non-daredevils who hike through thick pine forest on well-marked trails and climb onto the track at various spots along the way. The trailhead is a cheap, 10-minute taxi ride outside the city for a rare opportunity to see a bizarre Olympic ruin. _line_The Pino Nature Hotel, which opened near the top last year with a mid-century-meets-Aspen ski lodge feel, has a spa and a terrace with spectacular views of the mountain. It too, however, is a dry venue, but the restaurant is worth a visit for its hearty, updated Bosnian fare._line_Pino Nature Hotel, Trebevi\xc4\x87 - Ravne 1, 71000 Sarajevo, BiH +387 33 257 800_line_8. Drink rakija on a night out_line_Throughout the Balkans, rakija is a staple served at parties and weddings, with dinner at home, and at most bars as a boost of liquid courage. A clear brandy similar to grappa, it\'s distilled from various fruits, often plum, pear or apple but also from more exotic ingredients such as quince or walnuts. Just don\'t be fooled by the fruit flavors. This is potent stuff._line_Barhana in the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija serves many varieties as well as mezze, or small snacks, and tablets of cured meat and cheese similar to what you\'d find at Spanish tapas bars. All that toasting and tasting leads to some late nights -- some bars in Sarajevo don\'t close until 6 a.m. -- and lots of new friends. _line_"Sarajevo is the kind of place where you leave your place with five marks in your pocket, and somehow you come home at 6 a.m. with 10 marks and a full pack of cigarettes," says Cat Norman, who opened the Doctor\'s House Hostel about three years ago. "You\'ll see their generosity knows no limits." _line_Another popular place is Hacienda. What it lacks in Mexican authenticity it makes up for with a lively crowd and surprising margaritas. _line_Barhana, +387 33 447-727 \xc4\x90ulagina \xc4\x8dikma 8, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_Hacienda, +387 33 441-918, Bazard\xc5\xbeani 3, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_The Doctor\'s House Hostel, +387 61 222 914, Pehlivanu\xc5\xa1a 67, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_9. Get your kicks at an old porn theater_line_A night at Kino Bosna is a singular experience, Norman says. Before the war, it was a movie theater showing Hollywood movies and eventually porn films, but the owner fled and never came back. _line_One of the employees decided to open it as a bar, bringing in wooden chairs and red-checkered tablecloths and leaving up the old film posters._line_The owner has since become a Sarajevo legend. Because she\'s essentially squatting in her old boss\' business, she can\'t register to pay taxes. "The bar will get closed down for a week here and there, but she always finds a way to reopen it," Norman says. "It\'s what the party people want when you come to the Balkans." _line_Monday night is the best of the week, she says. That\'s when they have a lively band playing traditional sevdah music for tips._line_Kino Bosna, +387 61 866 946, Alipa\xc5\xa1ina 19, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia-Herzegovina_line_10. Glimpse at horrors or war from siege to Srebrenica_line_The tunnel that was a link to the outside world when the city was cut off by Serbian troops._line_Although there\'s much more to Sarajevo than war, the city has embraced its tortured past. Serbian troops cut the city off from the outside world, and rooftop snipers fired at anyone walking on the streets. _line_The only lifeline for supplies was an 800-meter tunnel that connected the people with smugglers from outside the city. The War Tunnel Museum has preserved a section of it and tells the tale of the family that risked their lives by allowing the entrance to pop up in their cellar._line_Another exhibition, the Srebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, focuses on the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust. In one month near the end of the war, Serbian troops slaughtered more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in one town, mostly men but also women and children, and buried the bodies in mass graves. _line_A photographer chronicled the lives of the survivors, who more than 20 years later still don\'t have all the answers about what happened to their family members. The black and white photos show the exhumation of graves, some of which had been moved several times to evade human rights inspectors. And hundreds of mothers supplied portraits of their sons who were killed, including some whose bodies were never identified._line_War Tunnel Museum, +387 33 684-032, Tuneli 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina _line_Srebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, +387 33 953 170, Trg Fra Grge Marti\xc4\x87a 2/III ,71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_11. Eat like a Bosnian _line_"In Balkan culture, men live with their mother," Norman says. "Then they get married, and the wife does the cooking. Then when the wife dies, they go to an ascinica." _line_Ascinica means a cafeteria that serves cheap, hearty food, often stews, and everything is served with somun, a type of grilled flatbread similar to pita. One good option is ASD\xc5\xbd. _line_Bosnians also claim they have the best version of a Balkan staple called \xc4\x8devapi (pronounced chuh-VAH-pee). It\'s grilled links of minced beef or lamb stuffed into somun with onions and sometimes sour cream, and it\'s one of the most satisfying street food meals anywhere. For the most authentic, locals recommend Zeljo or Petica._line_Roast lamb is also serious business, particularly at the fine-dining 4 Sobe Gospodje Safije, which translates to the 4 Rooms of Mrs. Safije. Their take, considered one of the best in the country, is cooked for 20 hours and served with a garlic sauce, pistachio pesto and crushed potatoes._line_ASD\xc5\xbd, +387 33 238 500, \xc4\x86ur\xc4\x8diluk mali 3, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_\xc5\xbdeljo, +387 33 441-200, Kundurd\xc5\xbeiluk 19, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_\xc4\x86evabd\xc5\xbeinica Petica Ferhatovi\xc4\x87, +387 33 537-555, Bravad\xc5\xbeiluk 29, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina_line_4 Sobe Gospodje Safije, Cekalusa 61, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina +387 33 202-745_line_BONUS: History and a hike_line_The Sarajevo Free Walking Tour provides an excellent way to get bearings as well a dose of history during two-hour strolls through the city.

S'Executive Summary_line_One of the most common ways companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results. New research illuminates how diversity training effectiveness can depend on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes. Experiments conducted with college students reveal two promising options: perspective taking (walking a mile in someone\xe2\x80\x99s shoes) and goal setting (for example, setting a goal to speak out the next time you hear someone make a biased comment)._line_One of the most common ways that companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results: Some studies show that diversity training is effective, others show it\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective, and still others show that it may actually lead to backlash. This has led to pessimism regarding diversity training, with some claiming it simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work._line_We believe that pessimism is premature. For one, a recent meta-analysis of over 40 years of diversity training evaluations showed that diversity training can work, especially when it targets awareness and skill development and occurs over a significant period of time. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there\xe2\x80\x99s a single perfect solution to creating diverse and inclusive organizations. Diversity training effectiveness depends on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes._line_Our research highlights how changing a few aspects of diversity training might actually make a difference, depending on how they\xe2\x80\x99re applied within organizations. While our work takes the form of small-scale experiments with undergraduate students, we believe it has potential to be used smartly inside companies. And since undergraduate students are undoubtedly future employees, we view uncovering what works for this group as a first step in discovering what might work for the broader population of working adults. Additionally, using a population of students affords us a greater degree of experimental control (by incorporating a control condition where no diversity training is received for comparison purposes, comparing the effects of specific training exercises with one another, and measuring multiple outcomes over time), which allows us to uncover truths regarding diversity training effectiveness in a way that may not be as feasible in businesses or other organizations._line_One training exercise that we analyzed, and that shows promise, is perspective-taking, which is essentially the process of mentally walking in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. Results from our experiment involving 118 undergraduate students showed that taking the perspective of LGBT individuals or racial minorities \xe2\x80\x94 by writing a few sentences imagining the distinct challenges a marginalized minority might face \xe2\x80\x94 can improve pro-diversity attitudes and behavioral intentions toward these groups. These effects persisted even when outcomes were measured eight months after training. Even more exciting is the fact that perspective-taking was shown to be capable of producing crossover effects. In our experiment, taking the perspective of LBGT individuals was shown to be associated with more positive attitudes and behaviors toward racial minorities, and vice versa._line_Another activity that has empirical support is goal setting. Recent evidence shows that this strategy \xe2\x80\x94 more broadly used to motivate improved aspects of someone\xe2\x80\x99s job performance \xe2\x80\x94 can be successfully adapted by asking diversity training participants to set specific, measurable, and challenging (yet attainable) goals related to diversity in the workplace. For example, a trainee might set a goal to challenge inappropriate comments about marginalized groups when overhearing them in the future (in combination with receiving information about how best to handle such situations). Our experiment with 158 undergraduate students showed that goal setting within diversity training led to more pro-diversity behaviors three months after training and improved pro-diversity attitudes nine months after training. These long-lasting effects are notable, given that diversity training sessions in organizations are usually few and far between._line_Both of these exercises (perspective-taking and goal setting) produced effects on behavioral outcomes, such as displaying more support and engaging in less mistreatment toward marginalized minorities. These are arguably the most important outcomes, but are often neglected in diversity training research in favor of attitudinal outcomes (the prejudice and bias that one feels toward marginalized groups) and cognitive outcomes (how well-informed someone is regarding stereotypes and biases against marginalized groups)._line_Our work also shows that personality characteristics may influence the effectiveness of training, making particular strategies more effective for some employees and less effective for others. For example, perspective-taking may be more effective for individuals who lack empathy than for those who are highly empathetic. We think this is the case because individuals who are high in empathy may be more likely to engage in spontaneous perspective-taking on their own, whereas individuals who are low on this characteristic may need a diversity training activity as a prompt. Similarly, our work (which we presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) has shown that individuals who are high on social dominance orientation \xe2\x80\x94 the degree to which an individual prefers majority groups dominating minorities within a social hierarchy \xe2\x80\x94 tend to be more resistant to diversity training than individuals who are low on this trait. However, there is hope: Having an authority figure endorse the importance of diversity initiatives can enhance the effect of training for these individuals, in effect providing a means to appeal to and reach potentially resistant trainees._line_So, as you design or tweak your company\xe2\x80\x99s diversity training program, keep these findings in mind. A blanket program will likely be a waste of your time \xe2\x80\x94 and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 time. But by tailoring empirically supported exercises and activities to your goals and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 characteristics, you can make progress in making your organization more welcoming and inclusive._line_'

S'Courtesy of Silversea Cruises_line_Stepping onboard Silver Muse is like catching a glimpse of the future: The 596-passenger ship, the largest in Silversea\xe2\x80\x99s fleet of ten, is meant to be a preview of vessels to come. Turns out, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stunning future indeed. Swathed in earth tones with occasional hits of soft colors and plenty of rich wood detailing, Silver Muse is a master class in understated luxury. The result is a refined design that feels almost as restful as the sea._line_But perhaps the biggest change from the previous vessels is the number of restaurants. There are eight of them in all \xe2\x80\x94 a huge number considering the size of the ship \xe2\x80\x94 so passengers on shorter cruises can try a different spot for dinner each night. Spaccanopoli, a casual outdoor pizza restaurant above the pool, is a hit thanks to fresh ingredients and perfect dough; Indochine, a pan-Asian restaurant inspired by Marco Polo\xe2\x80\x99s travels, thankfully doesn\xe2\x80\x99t skimp on the spice; and Atlantide, a grand formal seafood restaurant, also has plenty for meat lovers and vegetarians to love._line_And then there are the little things Silversea does so well: welcome champagne, speedy internet, and 24-7 butler service that manages to be both attentive and unobtrusive. It all adds up to a next-level experience at sea._line_Travel + Leisure was recently invited as a guest by Silversea to sail from Marseilles to Palma de Mallorca on Silver Muse. Here are a few of our favorite things we experienced on the ship._line_'

S' Hyper Scoop: Motor Trend gets the first extended drive in a Tesla Model 3 _line_The Tesla Model 3 is here, and it is the most important vehicle of the century. _line_Yes, the hyperbole is necessary. The original Tesla Model S was a proof of concept\xe2\x80\x94it was possible to make a long-range electric vehicle. The Model X showed that you could make an electric SUV. But neither was affordable to the masses. And although the Chevrolet Bolt has shown that 238 miles of electric range is possible for less than $40,000, GM\xe2\x80\x99s volume aspirations are modest._line_Not so for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wants to blow out the walls of his Fremont, California, factory to build a half-million Tesla Model 3s every year._line_Tesla gave Motor Trend an opportunity for an extended test drive with the Tesla Model 3 engineer. Following is Testing Director Kim Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 review._line_Thirty-six hours before Elon Musk hands the keys to the first 30 purchasers of the new Tesla Model 3 electric car, we are waiting at a gravel parking lot at the corner of Mullholland Highway and Old Topanga Road in Malibu. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d somebody asks. \xe2\x80\x9c8 a.m.\xe2\x80\x9d replies videographer Cory Lutz as he and Travis Labella ready an arsenal of GoPros. Everybody\xe2\x80\x94photographers Brian Vance and William Walker, me, the video guys\xe2\x80\x94are taking turns shooting glances up Old Topanga. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching for a red car._line_8:05: \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I hear somebody say. He is Franz von Holtzhausen, chief designer for Tesla. And the red car is not only his, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the most awaited and speculated-about automobiles in years\xe2\x80\x94the Tesla Model 3, a car I\xe2\x80\x99ve overheard relatives talking about who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many cylinders their Camry\xe2\x80\x99s engine has. The scene felt a little like Hollywood paparazzi staking out Justin Bieber again, but this time it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hijacking. In a somewhat intimidating coup, Franz is going to let me tear up and down nearby Stunt Road in it (and what better name for a test route, eh?)._line_Franz emerges. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s a pedigreed car designer after deployments with VW, GM (Pontiac Solstice), and Mazda, the guy\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly Hollywood-cast for the Tesla taste-meister part, in black jeans, back T-shirt, and aviator sunglasses. And his car appears remarkably similar to the prototype. \xe2\x80\x9cWe softened the nose\xe2\x80\x99s frown a little, and these proximity sensors are new, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with a shrug. At the back, the parting lines do elegant double-duty as air-separation creases, the charging port\xe2\x80\x99s flap flips upward now, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no external badging at all, besides the Tesla logos. Franz climbs into the passenger seat as I slide in on his left. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive it like you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d he commands. \xe2\x80\x9cLike you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d I correct him with a crooked smile._line_Anyone familiar with the Model S will quickly feel oriented with the smaller Tesla Model 3. There\xe2\x80\x99s the shifter stalk on the right (reverse up, drive down, depress for park), but now with extra taps once under way, it doubles as the cruise-control lever. All of the car\xe2\x80\x99s infographics reside on a 15.4-inch, landscape-oriented multitouch screen that\xe2\x80\x99s perched on an austere, sweeping, almost Scandinavian-simple, dash. And being a Tesla, it\xe2\x80\x99s an hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre tray of software delectables. Interior air (from subtle vents) is aimed by moving spots around on the display, even dividing the airflow to send it past each ear. There\xe2\x80\x99s a wallet-able security card that plugs in, acting as a valet key. Other coolnesses? Franz\xe2\x80\x99 car is a loaded version\xe2\x80\x94a Premium (add $5,000), meaning better-grade materials, wood-veneered dash, 12-way front seats, 12-speaker sound, heated rear seats, side-by-side inductive phone chargers, and that panoramic glass ceiling that nevertheless protects like SPF 90 sunscreen. A detail that tickled me: One of the assignable functions of the twin thumb scrolls on the wheel spokes is tilting and telescoping the steering column. Cool. You adjust the wheel with your hands right where they should be. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take a lot more miles than this to decide if the single off-center screen completely substitutes for a conventionally located gauge cluster, but I\xe2\x80\x99m already adapting to it. At least I can always see the mph display near my right hand position (upper left corner of the screen) versus it being often half-hidden behind spokes._line_Tesla worked hard to increase interior space, and subjectively it succeeded. For a compact car, the Model 3 feels incredibly light and airy. The dash is pulled ahead and pressed down, but cleverly, the touchscreen is apart from that, close to your right hand. (It was embedded into the Model S\xe2\x80\x99 dash, constraining them to be equidistant.) The Tesla Model 3 has a trunk opening instead of a Model S-like hatch to delete the hatch-required crossmember, which shaves rear headroom. The prototype\xe2\x80\x99s trunk opening was criticized as too small; now it\xe2\x80\x99s yawning. And at 15 cubic feet, with a very low lift-over and 60/40 folding rear seats, it looks hungry for a surfboard or a bike. (Franz assures me of this; he\xe2\x80\x99s a cyclist.) Up front, the frunk is precisely sized to hold a carry-on suitcase. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s too big here,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to check it.\xe2\x80\x9d I tap the stalk down into drive, and we arc out onto Mulholland._line_And then the foot goes down. How does it drive? The gush of torque clearly indicates DNA shared with the Model S. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s a new motor specific to the 3; Franz is coy about its horsepower, but Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s claim of 0-60 in 5.1 seconds seems right when paired with this car\xe2\x80\x99s $9,000 long-range battery. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a choice of two batteries. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s trying to change the vocabulary we\xe2\x80\x99re using to describe it, from \xe2\x80\x9ckilowatt-hours\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crange.\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says the standard one (while still doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds) will travel 220 miles, but his provides 310 miles of range. (Supercharging is available but at a fee that\xe2\x80\x99s attractive compared to filling with an equivalent amount of gasoline.)_line_What\xe2\x80\x99s blanching, though, is the car\xe2\x80\x99s ride and handling. If anybody was expecting a typical boring electric sedan here, nope. The ride is Alfa Giulia (maybe even Quadrifoglio)\xe2\x80\x93firm, and quickly, I\xe2\x80\x99m carving Stunt Road like a Sochi Olympics giant slalomer, micrometering my swipes at the apexes. I glance at Franz\xe2\x80\x94this OK? \xe2\x80\x9cGo for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he nods. The Model 3 is so unexpected scalpel-like, I\xe2\x80\x99m sputtering for adjectives. The steering ratio is quick, the effort is light (for me), but there\xe2\x80\x99s enough light tremble against your fingers to hear the cornering negotiations between Stunt Road and these 235/40R19 tires (Continental ProContact RX m+s\xe2\x80\x99s). And to mention body roll is to have already said too much about it. Sure, that battery is low, way down under the floor. But unlike the aluminum Model S, the Tesla Model 3 is composed of steel, too, and this car\xe2\x80\x99s glass ceiling can\xe2\x80\x99t be helping the center of gravity\xe2\x80\x99s height. Nearly-nil body roll? Magic, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. Magic. And this is the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive starting point. The already boggled mind boggles further at the mention of Dual Motor and Ludicrous._line_The photographers stare, looking bummed they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten everything they wanted, but Franz has got to go. He\xe2\x80\x99s heading up to that same key handover in Fremont. Handshakes, then the red car silently whooshes out of sight around a corner, leaving a vacuum that\xe2\x80\x99s instantly filling with questions: Have I ever driven a more startling small sedan? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. At speed, it gains a laser-alertness I haven\xe2\x80\x99t encountered before. By happenstance, associate road test editor Erick Ayapana had penciled me into a 2.0-liter Alfa Romeo Giulia to get here, and it feels like a wet sponge by comparison. Technological fascination? Besides what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already described, the Tesla Model 3 is available with Enhanced Autopilot ($5,000) and for another $3,000 what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving Capability\xe2\x80\x9d in the future. A lot of money, sure\xe2\x80\x94but how many $35,000 cars offer that? Or for that matter, standard over-the-air updatability?_line_But of course, Franz\xe2\x80\x99s car isn\xe2\x80\x99t $35,000.

S'Entering its eighth generation, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom exudes the same sense of tradition and formidability as its predecessors. But it looks like Rolls was also going for something more powerful, more artistic, and dare we say, more modern._line_"The need to modernize the Phantom was absolutely clear for us," Rolls-Royce design boss Giles Taylor said at a reveal event. "We wanted to give this car a little more energy."_line_To that end, the flagship receives evolutionary design updates while staying true to its 92-year history. Rolls raised the grille higher and integrated it into new protruding lines that run across the hood. Making its presence known, the Spirit of Ecstasy sits about half an inch higher, and the headlamps feature a new square-shaped lighting graphic. New lines across the side give the bodywork a more fluid look. The top line begins at the hood and ends just above the door handles, while another fades from in front of the front wheel to just before the back wheel. In the rear, the Phantom reveals its new sloped, coupelike roof and a larger license plate holder. The rectangular taillight graphic nicely complements the lights up front, and 22-inch wheels complete the design._line_Under that restyled hood sits a brand-new 6.75-liter V-12 engine with two turbochargers. The engine produces 563 hp, up from 453 hp produced by the naturally aspirated V-12 on the previous Phantom. Torque is 664 lb-ft, instead of 531 lb-ft on the old model. Power is routed through a ZF eight-speed automatic. Accelerating to 62 mph from a standstill takes 5.3 seconds in the short-wheelbase version and 5.4 seconds in the longer model, which weighs a whopping 5,948 pounds unladen._line_Even more important, the Phantom sits on a new architecture that will eventually underpin every Rolls-Royce model. That includes the upcoming Project Cullinan "high-sided, all-terrain motor car" as well as the next Ghost, Wraith, Dawn, and future coachbuild projects. Rolls says the all-aluminum spaceframe architecture is about 30 percent more rigid than the Phantom\'s old platform, and it can accommodate different types of propulsion and the different weight requirements of future new models. The new architecture helps keep weight down and should improve ride comfort, Rolls says._line_Also promising increased ride comfort, the new Phantom features the latest-gen air suspension, four-wheel steering, and a new double-wishbone front axle and five-link rear axle. The Phantom is said to be 10 percent quieter than its predecessor while traveling at 62 mph, thanks to better insulation in the form of a new sound absorbing headliner, silent-seal tires with a foam layer placed inside the tire to prevent tire cavity noise, a two-layer glazing around the car, and what Rolls calls the largest ever cast aluminum joints in a body-in-white. Rolls said that after running road and vibration tests on the new Phantom, an acoustics engineer had to check whether the instruments were working correctly because the sound levels were so low._line_Everyone assumes the Phantom customer is the passenger rather than the driver. For the chauffeur, closing the doors after letting in a passenger requires a simple tap of a sensor on the exterior door handle. For the convenience of the passenger, the front and rear doors now close from the inside with the push of a button._line_Once inside the cabin, the first thing you\'ll likely notice is the new Gallery, which includes customized artwork set underneath a piece of glass that covers the full width of the dashboard. The best part is you can put in any kind of artwork you\'d like. Rolls has already created examples of such art, everything from oil paintings, a collection of porcelain roses, an abstract design crafted from silk, and even a gold-plated 3-D-printed map of an owner\'s DNA. "I wanted to take the motoring constant that has existed for a century but served little purpose but to hide airbags and componentry, and give it another purpose, space to breathe," Taylor said in a statement._line_The overall look is an improvement from the dash area of the previous Phantom, which was starting to grow a bit dated because of the physical gauges on the instrument cluster. Now, the instruments are digital and are set off by round chrome surrounds._line_The new Phantom continues with the tradition of offering the Starlight Headliner, and the new one is the largest ever on a Rolls. Along with the softest carpet you can likely imagine (trust us), the Phantom offers customers a choice of different seat types, including lounge seats and a sleeping seat. In the rear, a center console comes complete with whisky glasses and decanter, champagne flutes, and a Coolbox. You\'ll also find rear picnic tables and monitors that can be put up and down with the push of a button. Rather than just offering heated seats, Rolls-Royce includes heating for the front door armrests, rear side armrests and rear center armrest, front center console lid, and the lower C-Pillar. And whether you\'re the driver or the passenger, you\'ll be comforted by safety features including collision warning, cross-traffic warning, a head-up display, active cruise control, lane departure and lane change warning, and a host of other aids._line_With an even nicer interior and more powerful engine befitting its large size, the Phantom achieves a more modern feel than the seventh generation that made its debut back in 2003. But the goal is still the same: offer the smoothest, most accommodating means of conveyance in the world_line_'

That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the possible future applications of a technique researchers have used to genetically engineer blue chrysanthemums for the first time._line_Chyrsanthemums come in an array of colours, including pink, yellow and red. But all it took to engineer the truly blue hue\xe2\x80\x94and not a violet or bluish colour\xe2\x80\x94was tinkering with two genes, scientists report in a study published on July 26 in Science Advances. The team says that the approach could be applied to other commercially important flowers, including carnations and lilies._line_\xe2\x80\x9cConsumers love novelty,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nick Albert, a plant biologist at the New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research in Palmerston North, New Zealand. And \xe2\x80\x9cpeople actively seek out plants with blue flowers to fill their gardens\xe2\x80\x9d._line_Plenty of flowers are bluish, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rare to find true blue in nature, says Naonobu Noda, a plant researcher at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization near Tsukuba, Japan, and lead study author. Scientists, including Noda, have tried to artificially produce blue blooms for years: efforts that have often produced violet or bluish hues in flowers such as roses and carnations. Part of the problem is that naturally blue blossoming plants aren\xe2\x80\x99t closely related enough to commercially important flowers for traditional methods\xe2\x80\x94including selective breeding\xe2\x80\x94to work._line_Most truly blue blossoms overexpress genes that trigger the production of pigments called delphinidin-based anthocyanins. The trick to getting blue flowers in species that aren\xe2\x80\x99t naturally that colour is inserting the right combination of genes into their genomes. Noda came close in a 2013 study when he and his colleagues found that adding a gene from a naturally blue Canterbury bells flower (Campanula medium) into the DNA of chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum morifolium) produced a violet-hued bloom._line_Getting the blues_line_Noda says he and his team expected that they would need to manipulate many more genes to get the blue chrysanthemum they produced in their latest study. But to their surprise, adding only one more borrowed gene from the naturally blue butterfly pea plant (Clitoria ternatea) was enough._line_Anthocyanins can turn petals red, violet or blue, depending on the pigment\xe2\x80\x99s structure. Noda and his colleagues found that genes from the Canterbury bells and butterfly pea altered the molecular structure of the anthocyanin in the chrysanthemum. When the modified pigments interacted with compounds called flavone glucosides, the resulting chrysanthemum flowers were blue. The team tested the wavelengths given off by their blossoms in several ways to ensure that the flowers were truly blue._line_The quest for blue blooms wouldn't only be applicable to the commercial flower market. Studying how these pigments work could also lead to the sustainable manufacture of artificial pigments, says Silvia Vignolini, a physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK, who has studied the molecular structure of the intensely blue marble berry._line_Regardless, producing truly blue flowers \xe2\x80\x9cis a great achievement and demonstrates that the underlying chemistry required to achieve 'blue' is complex and remains to be fully understood\xe2\x80\x9d, says Albert._line_"

S"Einstein's theory of special relativity sets of the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second (300 million meters per second). But some scientists are exploring the possibility that this cosmic speed limit changes._line_ In 2015, a team of Scottish scientists announced they had found a way to slow the speed of light. By sending photons through a special mask, the researchers altered their shape. In this malformed state, these infinitesimal particles of light traveled slower than normal photons._line_ The difference in speed was almost imperceptible, but the accomplishment itself was stunning! At 299,792,458 meters per second, the speed of light has stood as an unbreakable, unchangeable speed limit. No longer._line_ But why would anybody want to slow down the speed of light? After all, it's already slow enough!_line_ As strange as that assertion may seem to humans accustomed to traveling a mere 70 miles per hour on the highway, it makes a lot of sense on a cosmic scale. Consider this: If the observable Universe was reduced to the size of planet Earth, traversing the Milky Way Galaxy would be roughly equivalent to walking three houses down the block to visit your neighbor. And yet, traveling at the cosmic speed limit of our smaller, Earth-size universe, that short jaunt would take 100,000 years!_line_ This example showcases just how tediously slow exploring the galaxy would be for a ship traveling at the speed of light. Such a journey would span more than a hundred human generations!_line_ Even if you don't consider humanity's self-centered wish for interstellar light-speed travel and instead think about photons dashing across our solar system, the speed of light still seems positively sluggish. As astrophysicist Brian Koberlein calculated, it takes 45 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Jupiter, and five hours for it to reach Pluto._line_ And of course, when gazing at the sky with the naked eye, we're viewing some stars as they were more than 4,000 years in the past -- that's how long it takes their light to reach us!_line_ So now that we've ascertained that light is not fast but rather is excruciatingly slow, we can now turn to a more pressing and difficult matter: Why?_line_ Theoretical physicists can muse and cosmologists can measure, but all their learned tinkering currently leads back to an inescapable answer: Because._line_ Theoretical physicist Gennaro Tedesco provided a slightly more satisfying version:_line_ The universe is made such that photons propagate with that velocity, there is no reason why it should be so, but it is just the way it is. Physics does not explain why things are what they are, rather it explains how to make predictions by using proven models._line_ Okay, so like in much of theoretical physics, the answer is effectively a non-answer, and we're still stuck in a slow universe._line_ To salvage this situation, let's examine a scenario where light is much faster. What would existence be like if, say, the speed of light was boosted by a factor of 1,000? Steve Jones explored the hypothetical. A light-speed vessel could cross the Milky Way in less than a century! A trip to Alpha Centauri, home to a potentially habitable planet, would take fewer than two days! Computers and networks would run faster thanks to enhanced optical speeds! We might be more likely to receive signals from extraterrestrials!_line_ But \xe2\x80\x93 and this is a big but \xe2\x80\x93 the Sun would burn a million times hotter. We'd be cooked._line_ So you better learn to love our finely tuned speed of light, however slothlike it may be. If it were any faster, life on Planet Earth might not exist._line_"

S'Story Highlights_line_ Prashant Kishor, election strategist, had cabinet minister rank _line_ But he cannot be linked to Nitish Kumar\'s new alliance with BJP _line_ Prashant Kishor wants to work with anti-BJP parties _line_Patna: Nitish Kumar\'s list of exes is growing - along with the Congress and Lalu Yadav who are now a part of his past, top aide Prashant Kishor is being cut looses. Sources close to the young election strategist and Nitish Kumar say the separation is mutual, without rancour, and in acceptance of the fact that the new political landscape requires Prashant Kishore to shift out of the Chief Minister\'s home where he lived while in Patna. _line_ However, Prashant Kishor left the Bihar capital in April 2016 to work with the Congress on its campaign to get Amarinder Singh elected as Chief Minister of Punjab. He has, since then, spent only seven hours in Patna, said sources, on a short stopover in April. At the time, he handed a resignation letter to the Chief Minister. It was undated. Nitish Kumar, he said, could use it whenever needed. _line_ Prashant Kishor met Nitish Kumar through top aides of the Chief Minister in 2014. Both were smarting from political setbacks. Prashant Kishor helped design and deploy the hi-tech campaign that saw Narendra Modi become Prime Minister. Nitish Kumar, in a major miscalculation, had aborted his alliance with the PM\'s party ahead of the general election. Prashant Kishor was being sidelined by the PM\'s closest aide, Amit Shah. Nitish Kumar had won just two parliamentary seats in Bihar. _line_ They decided to work together on the re-election bid of Nitish Kumar for a third back-to-back term as Chief Minister. Nitish Kumar allegedly ignored Prashant Kishor\'s early objections to proceed with a three-way alliance with the Congress and former rival Lalu Yadav. For the opposing team, the Prime Minister campaigned relentlessly across Bihar. But it was the "Grand Alliance" or Maha-Gathbandhan, which combined the caste-based support groups of the different parties that proved super-strong. Nitish Kumar took office and the opposition at the national level began accepting that to defeat PM Modi and his immense approval ratings, it was this sort of multi-party arrangement that would have to be constructed. _line_ Prashant Kishor, as thanks for Nitish Kumar\'s big win, was given the rank of a cabinet minister and assigned to implement a major programme - the Bihar Vikas Mission - for the development of the state that included seven schemes including electricity for all and credit cards for students. Prashant Kishor, advised by Nitish Kumar to dress in a white kurta-pyjama while in Patna, remained an occupant of the Chief Minister\'s home at the time (Nitish Kumar has since moved into another house) but accepted neither the salary nor the perks due to him with his new status. _line_ He did not attend a single meeting called to implement the policies entrusted to him. But the Chief Minister had by then accepted his desire to work for the Congress to win the Punjab election. There was no conflict of interest - the party was after all in alliance with Nitish Kumar in his home state. He was loaning an asset with a track record of electoral home runs. _line_ Though his client won Punjab, it was pelted in the politically-prized state of Uttar Pradesh and the hill state of Uttarakhand despite Prashant Kishor designing both campaigns. He then moved south to explore working with Jagan Mohan Reddy, opposition leader in Andhra Pradesh. It was earlier this month that the deal was formally announced as done. _line_Last week, when Nitish Kumar junked the Congress and Lalu Yadav to restore his old alliance with the BJP, it became clear that Prashant Kishor would have to officially be dropped from any role in Bihar. The 40-year-old strategist has made no secret of his commitment to working with anti-BJP parties and in particular the Congress to get even for being marginalised after the big 2014 triumph. Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP, now the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, has in the past questioned the senior rank accorded to Prashant Kishor, who, he said, was perpetually MIA. _line_ It\'s unclear whether Nitish Kumar will announce that Prashant Kishor is no longer linked in any way to his administration. Given his fondness for the strategist, a loose understanding of moving on may suffice. For Prashant Kishor, said to now be keen on foraying into Tamil Nadu, the timing is propitious - he is now free of any obligations that would bind him to Patna._line_'

He moved to the top of the leaderboard with an initial best time of 1m56.039s a third of the way through the 30-minute session. _line_He then strung three fastest sectors together on his second run as he lowered his benchmark to a 1m55.786s - leaving him 0.460 seconds clear of early pacesetter Colin Turkington. _line_Goff returned to the pits early and, with WSR BMW 125i M Sport driver Turkington unable to improve, celebrated a maiden BTCC pole - beating his previous best of second from the Donington Park round earlier this year. _line_"We rolled the car out in FP1 as we\'d left it after the test day [but] the car felt nothing like it had then," said Goff. _line_"The lads did a bit of work after FP2 and it completely transformed it." _line_The factory Team BMR Subaru of Ash Sutton had an initial effort that was good enough for third chalked off for exceeding track limits, but a lap with a little more than a minute of the session remaining returned him to the position behind Turkington. _line_Speedworks Motorsport\'s Tom Ingram was fourth in his Toyota Avensis, ahead of the similar car of Handy Motorsport\'s Rob Austin - who rotated at Riches shortly after his fast lap.\xe2\x80\xa8 _line_Andrew Jordan was seventh in his Pirtek Racing WSR BMW 125i M Sport, while Jason Plato improved to eighth with the final lap of the session in his Subaru Levorg. _line_Championship leader Gordon Shedden endured a tough session, and could only qualify 20th. _line_ Saddled with the maximum 75 kilograms of success ballast, Shedden finished the session 1.657s slower than polesitter Goff. _line_Shedden\'s team-mate Matt Neal had sat as high as third in the order in the first half of the session, but his Honda Civic failed a ride height test as he returned to the pits and he subsequently had all his times deleted. _line_With his car raised, Neal returned to the weigh bridge after an outlap to ensure his car was legal and only made it out on track for a pair of timed runs in the final five minutes, ending up 23rd._line_QUALIFYING RESULTS:_line_Pos_line_Driver_line_Team_line_Car_line_Gap_line_1_line_Jack Goff_line_Eurotech Racing_line_Honda_line_1m55.786s_line_2_line_Colin Turkington_line_WSR_line_BMW_line_0.460s_line_3_line_Ash Sutton_line_Team BMR_line_Subaru_line_0.589s_line_4_line_Tom Ingram_line_Speedworks Motorsport_line_Toyota_line_0.877s_line_5_line_Adam Morgan_line_Ciceley Racing_line_Mercedes_line_0.900s_line_6_line_Rob Austin_line_Handy Motorsport_line_Toyota_line_1.004s_line_7_line_Andrew Jordan_line_WSR_line_BMW_line_1.078s_line_8_line_Jason Plato_line_Team BMR_line_Subaru_line_1.238s_line_9_line_Rob Collard_line_WSR_line_BMW_line_1.239s_line_10_line_Jake Hill_line_Team Hard_line_Volkswagen_line_1.271s_line_11_line_Michael Epps_line_Team Hard_line_Volkswagen_line_1.281s_line_12_line_Mat Jackson_line_Motorbase_line_Ford_line_1.354s_line_13_line_Aiden Moffat_line_Laser Tools Racing_line_Mercedes_line_1.385s_line_14_line_Ant Whorton-Eales_line_AmD Tuning_line_Audi_line_1.405s_line_15_line_Tom Chilton_line_Power Maxed Racing_line_Vauxhall_line_1.476s_line_16_line_Ollie Jackson_line_AmD Tuning_line_Audi_line_1.489s_line_17_line_Josh Price_line_Team BMR_line_Subaru_line_1.556s_line_18_line_Dave Newsham_line_BTC Racing_line_Chevrolet_line_1.582s_line_19_line_Josh Cook_line_Triple Eight/MG_line_MG_line_1.635s_line_20_line_Gordon Shedden_line_Dynamics/Honda_line_Honda_line_1.657s_line_21_line_Chris Smiley_line_BTC Racing_line_Chevrolet_line_1.663s_line_22_line_Brett Smith_line_Eurotech Racing_line_Honda_line_1.676s_line_23_line_Matt Neal_line_Dynamics/Honda_line_Honda_line_1.778s_line_24_line_Matt Simpson_line_Dynamics/Honda_line_Honda_line_1.804s_line_25_line_Aron Taylor-Smith_line_Triple Eight/MG_line_MG_line_1.875s_line_26_line_James Cole_line_Team BMR_line_Subaru_line_1.921s_line_27_line_Senna Proctor_line_Power Maxed Racing_line_Vauxhall_line_1.932s_line_28_line_Will Burns_line_Team Hard_line_Volkswagen_line_2.525s_line_29_line_Stephen Jelley_line_Team Parker Racing_line_Ford_line_2.620s_line_30_line_Martin Depper_line_Motorbase_line_Ford_line_3.019s_line_31_line_Stewart Lines_line_Maximum Motorsport_line_Ford_line_4.965s_line_Share this article on  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Google+  Email_line_'

S' Redesigning a website, being a continuous process, and being the fruit of rigorous analysis and evaluation, it often turns out to be difficult on the part of the designers to actually realize when a website is more or less perfect to be launched for the users to experience it.

S'Supreme Court Judge Madan B Lokur today advocated the need for a better infrastructure, timely release of funds and setting up vulnerable witness courts for the welfare of needy children in Madhya Pradesh. _line_ "In the morning session, some valuable suggestions came from the participants. They have suggested that there is a problem of infrastructure in Juvenile Justice Boards, Child Welfare Committees... The infrastructure is not good," Justice Lokur said presiding over the state conference on Juvenile Justice and Capacity Building organised by UNICEF among others, here. _line_ "There is a need to improve and strengthen infrastructure there," Supreme Court\'s Juvenile Justice Committee Chairman Justice Lokur added. _line_ "There is also a need of manpower at these centres and institutes," he said. _line_ "Posts need to be created (in these centres)," he suggested. _line_ Looking at Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the stage, he said "if you please look (into them), this will help tremendously." _line_ Justice Lokur laying thrust on digital India concept, said, "I think we need to provide computer also to child care institutions... because unless we have the data about - number of children, what is their age, how they are? What food and clothes they are getting? _line_ "Unless we are aware of this, we can\'t make progress. _line_Computer will generate huge data base and facilitate planning," he added. _line_ "We also need to look at vulnerable witness courts. _line_You have a lot of cases of sexual offences against women, against children under the POCSO Act," Justice Lokur said. _line_ "Can you imagine a person who has raped some lady is standing there as an accused and the lady victim is being cross examined in the presence of the accused person, who had may be two or three months ago raped this woman," he quipped. _line_ "It is very, very difficult for such a lady to give evidence and it does not need skillful cross examiner...any lawyer can demolish the statement given by that lady," he added. _line_ "The same thing can happen to a child. The child who is 8 years or 10 years old," he added. _line_ "We recently had a case in the Supreme Court where a 10-year-old was raped and has become pregnant. Can you imagine the girl going to witness box and giving evidence and saying this is what happened," he quipped. _line_ "So, we need to protect witnesses. We need to protect witnesses whether they are women - whether they are children. _line_We need to have these vulnerable witness courts. It is not a very difficult job again," the Judge added. _line_ He said that the cost of setting up such a court comes to Rs 10 lakh. _line_ Some states have opened these courts, he added. _line_ "When we are dealing with children, we are not talking about punishment as deterrent. We are talking about punished as something restorative, to bring a child back to society, to rehabilitate the child in the society," he said. _line_ "So for this, we need some trained counsellors and psychiatrists," he added. _line_ In their speeches, Madhya Pradesh High Court Chief Justice Hemant Gupta as special guest and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as chief guest underlined the need of educating and making children an ideal citizen of the country. _line_ UNICEF state representative Michael Steven Juma in his address said, "protection of children is a critical indicator of the fulfillment of the rights of every children, which is fundamental requirement for realising other right. _line_ "Proper implementation of the law is a precursor to safeguarding the rights of children," Juma added._line_(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)_line_'

S'Dhaka: Bangladesh has to wait till 2019 to know whether the number of tigers in the Sunderbans has gone up or fallen further, according to officials conducting a census in the country\'s lone natural tiger habitat. It will take two years to determine the exact number of Royal Bengal Tigers living in the Bangladesh part of Sunderbans, they said. The Forest Department is conducting the census in collaboration with WildTeam, an NGO working for tiger conservation in the country, under the Bengal Tiger Conservation Activity project funded by the USAID, the Dhaka Tribune reported._line_File photo_line_The census, which began in November last year, is using camera trapping methodology to determine the overall tiger population in the world\'s largest mangrove forest, of which around 60 per cent lies within Bangladesh, the daily reported. The most recent census which concluded in 2015 recorded a tiger population of only 106 in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans, down from 440 in 2004. Project officials will want to know if this number has held up, or fallen further._line_ Data collection for the current census has already been completed in the Satkhira range of the mangrove forest and will be extended to the Khulna, Sharankhola and Chandpai ranges by 2019, the newspaper reported. The primary monitoring and count using the cameras in Satkhira began on December 1 and ended on March 15. A total of 45 officials and experts divided into six teams conducted the survey to determine the tiger population in Satkhira range._line_ In addition to recording tiger numbers, the project is also tracking their population density, movement and activity. "We set up 804 cameras at 402 stations in the range to collect data of tiger movement and density in the area," said Md Sayed Ali, divisional forest officer at the Sundarbans West Zone. Using photos taken by the cameras, the population in Satkhira range will be determined by analysing the stripes on the tigers, each tiger has its own unique set of stripes, similar to fingerprints for humans._line_ "We will have the accurate number of tigers in Satkhira by September," Sayed said. Besides the camera trapping method, the team has also surveyed tiger activity in the canals. Amir Hossain Chowdhury, director of the census project, said: "The photos are being analysed using the latest technologies. Once the analysis is done, we will get an idea about the population density and footprints of tigers in Satkhira range."_line_ Once the census in Satkhira is complete, the project will progress to survey the other three ranges of the Sundarbans, he added. "It might take two more years to complete the survey in the entire Sundarbans and find the exact number of tigers in the forest," Amir said. The Forest Department has undertaken the project following the declaration at the International Tiger Forum which took place in St Petersburg, Russia in 2010. _line_'

S'Siddaramaiah_line_ BENGALURU: Prodded by the Kannada Development Authority and faced with a barrage of protests by Kannada outfits, chief minister Siddaramaiah asked the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC) on Friday to drop Hindi from its signage. _line_ This means only Kannada and English will be on all signboards. _line_  The chief minister has written to the Centre that the three-language format would be counterproductive, given the sentiments in the state, and that Kannada and English in signage were more practical. _line_ Despite two attempts by protesters to deface its signboards, BMRC had continued to use Hindi saying it was operating under instructions from the Centre. In the past few weeks, as the agita tion intensified for the state language policy to be implemented, BMRC sought instructions from the state government to do away with the three-language format. _line_ LK Ateeq, principal secretary in the chief minister\'s office, confirmed to TOI the government had issued instructions to BMRC to use only Kannada and English. While this should put an end to the ongoing controversy, it may not be a permanent solution since the Centre is an equal stakeholder in the project and is yet to weigh in. _line_ In his letter to Union urban development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote: "I would like to submit that the stand of the Government of India of using the three-language formula is not reasonable. Although both the Government of India and government of Karnataka have equal (50:50) equity stake in BMRC, the financial contribution of the state government is much more than that of the central government. Moreover, the supervision of operations and providing security to BMRC are the responsibility of the state government." The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said the state "has also undertaken to repay all the loans contracted by BMRC and bear the operating losses. Therefore, it would be appropriate that the policies of the state government are implemented in the project. I would therefore request you to review your earlier decision in this regard". _line_ The Centre had instructed BMRC in December to follow the three-language policy. Accordingly, signage was in Kannada, English and Hindi. Siddaramaiah said protesters had been dealt with strictly when they tried to deface the signboards twice this month but added that the agitations could not be taken lightly. _line_ "You would agree that in the face of continued agitation and demands from litterateurs and intellectuals for giving primacy to the language of the state and the languages with which people of the city and the commuters are familiar, it is counter-productive to continue to insist on the use of three languages including Hindi," he said in the letter. "It is not essential to use Hindi in signage as the commuters who use the metro are comfortable with reading and understanding Kannada andor English. Therefore, the state government is compelled to ask BMRC to temporarily redesign the signage and name boards in metro stations without using Hindi," he said. _line_ BMRC, however, said it was unaware of the order. "We are yet to receive such a communication from the government," MD Pradeep Singh Kharola said, without specifying whether BMRC would implement such an order. _line_ Kannada activists and writers spearheading the protests welcomed the move. "BMRC has been violating the state language policy since 2011and although it has taken the government so many years to act, the decision is welcome and we hope that the government ensures its implementation," said Arun Javgal of Banavasi Balaga which started the language agitation. Writer Baragur Ramachandra said the larger issue was "intrusion of the federal structure" in local cultures and sentiments. "Removal of Hindi from signage is only a symbolic move," he said. _line_'

S'Where the tiger thrives, we know that nature is alive and well. If our current politicians lack the wisdom and foresight to know the value of this animal and its deep connection to our own future, then we must replace them with younger politicians who do_line_  For far too long, those in whose hands the destiny of India\'s 1.3 billion people lies have har boured the misconception that protecting wildlife or natural ecosystems is some kind of `favour\' we do to nature. Nothing can be farther from the truth. In fact, nature is quite capable of handling most problems we are creating for it, but the real danger is to us and our children because in the pursuit of `development\' as defined by those who understand short-term economics we are facing all manner of crises that simply cannot be solved by technology , money or even our most fervent prayers. _line_  These problems have everything to do with those four key human faults or frailties -ignorance, arrogance, avarice and apathy . It is these errors in our developmental compass that I have been trying to eliminate (with great success when it comes to young India, much less success when it comes to adults!) Here then are some simple tiger-priorities we have been communicating with children, which should be easy enough for even most (environmentally) checked-out planners to understand: _line_ OUR ECONOMY IS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF STABLE ECOLOGY, NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND _line_ The argument against taking vital long-term measures to pro tect our rivers, coastal habitats such as the magnificent Sunderbans mangrove forests, our lakes, grasslands and forests is that "India is a poor country and cannot afford the `luxury\' of environmental protection". This is not merely misplaced thinking, but downright dangerous. One of the last public utterances made by the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, before he demitted office was: "Next year the monsoon looks like it will be good, so we can expect our GDP to rise." Translated, it means every last nuance of our lives is governed by nature -agriculture, municipalities, factories, health, education, social stability. This is incontrovertible and I, for one, have never fully understood why seemingly savvy , intelligent leaders cannot get their heads around such a simple reality .I have faith that their innocence, trust and persistent reminders can and will change the world for the better. _line_ CHILDREN OPERATE ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TIGER IS A METAPHOR FOR ALL OF NATURE _line_ To save the tiger, we must save its forest home. In the process of doing this we end up saving all species, plant and animal, that live in tiger-inhabited areas. That\'s not all. These forests just happen to feed pure, fresh water into over 600 Indian rivers. And if that were not benefit enough, they sequester and store carbon and thus contribute by helping us to mitigate and adapt to climate change. _line_ We have taken this rationale to over a million children over the past five years and today these children have become positive agents of change who are influencing their faculties, school friends, families, and even powerful decision-makers ranging from Prime Ministers, Cabinet ministers, chief ministers and corporate heads. _line_ MAKE INVIOLABILITY OF PROTECTED AREAS A TOP GOVERNMENTAL PRIORITY _line_ India currently has over 600 protected forests. Together, these account for a little above 20% of the country\'s forested area, and under 5% of our land area. Yet, budgetary allocation is far too low, our staff is far less supported than they should be and every once in a while, even as the `system\' sings praises about tigers and the need to protect them, actual habitats continue to be threatened for short-term gains to facilitate the building of dams, roads, mines and more. _line_ PREVENT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, EXPAND WILDERNESSES AND RESTORE CORRIDORS _line_ It is well established that animals living on islands, or in habitats that are so small and fragmented as to mimic island conditions, are far more vulnerable to local extinction than species that live in contiguous, undisturbed habitat. The government must provide better protection to these and understand that tiger conservation will be a reality only if reserves are connected to one another so that tigers have larger population pools and larger areas in which to hunt and breed. _line_ WORK TO COUNTER CLIMATE CHANGE _line_ India must address climate change at all levels -central and state governments, corporates and individuals, cities and villages. We must adopt a "we are all in this together" approach, rather than wait for evidence that other governments are taking steps to correct their own contributions to the problem. _line_ RECOGNISE THAT THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE IS FUELLING TERRORISM _line_ The poaching of tigers and their prey species is rampant in India. In combination with the threats posed by habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and climate change, the situation is already beyond critical. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau needs to be strengthened and staffed by professionals and also needs to be linked to information and intelligence-gathering and decision-making that affects our internal security. Along with strong anti-poaching units on the frontlines, we must reopen communication lines with trusted local community members who could provide both information and field strength. In the case of hunting tribes, rehabilitation and measures to provide alternative livelihoods away from tiger habitats would be one vital step forward. _line_ CONSERVATION MUST RELY ON SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE _line_ Our commitment must be based on the soundest wildlife science -it has been science and the dedicated work of Indian and non-Indian wildlife biologists that have clearly shown what is needed to preserve this animal. _line_ For its part, the tiger does what it can to sur vive. Given undisturbed forest, water and prey species, the big cat breeds well. This is an animal in its evolutionary prime, highly adaptable. Where the tiger thrives, we know that nature is alive and well. If our current politicians lack the wisdom and foresight to know the value of this animal and its deep connection to our own future, then we must replace them with younger politicians who do.Common sense tells us that the degradation of the tiger and its home -the biota -and the diminishment of our own lives are two sides of one coin. And towards this end, those of us who have battled for decades do understand thatthe best tiger `habitat\' resides in the human heart. Here is where we must find space for them, or we will leave no space for them anywhere else. _line_ -  Bittu Sahgal _line_  (The writer is a celebrated conservationist and also the Editor and Chief Mentor of Sanctuary Nature Foundation) _line_ EXPERTS BAT FOR THE BIG CAT _line_ The tiger conservation scenario has been very positive in the last four years in Bengal. The first markers of this trend were sightings at Buxa Tiger Reserve and Neora Valley National Park. Also, there has been no incident of tiger poaching in last four years in the state. Besides, other than the two tiger reserves -Buxa and Sunderbans National park -there have been reports of tiger sightings in other forest areas as well. _line_ According to the ongoing tiger census with camera traps, the number is roughly around 103, but we will get the final number in November. The Centre and state have decided to start a new project at Buxa called Tiger Augmentation Plan, where we will bring tigers from other forests and help them breed. According to our survey, Buxa can house 10 to 12 tigers with ease. _line_ - RAVI KANT SINHA , _line_ IFS principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, West Bengal _line_ Unlike other forests in the country, Sunderbans is free of one menace -human encroachment in forest areas. We have clear demarcation between villages and forest areas and it has been like that for many years. But we have our own challenges. The two biggest would be poaching and man-animal conflicts. Though there have been a couple of natural deaths, there hasn\'t been a single instance of poaching in the past four years. This has been possible because of heavy patrolling by forest department and other administrative bodies. We have also resolved most mananimal conflicts by putting up nylon nets in the forest area.Last year, the number of tigers was 81 and this year it\'s 87.Importantly, this number doesn\'t include cubs and sub-adults. _line_ - NILANJAN MALLICK , _line_ IFS chief conservator of forests and field director, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve _line_ Every hour, every minute, every second, hundreds of tiger images are uploaded on social media. They win thousands of likes, comments and shares. Prince, Charger, Ustad, Noor, Machhli, Maya, Gabbar, Bittu, Jai -these wild tigers have illustrious names and have their family trees published, their day-to-day activities photographed and recorded minutely. These tigers from different tiger reserves are a privileged class. _line_ But as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority or NTCA\'s 2014 assessment, around 800 tigers live outside protected areas. They are vulnerable to poaching and can come into conflict with humans. This is a dangerously unsafe number and these tigers don\'t have forests to live in. They are not admired or even seen by tourists or photographers. We at SHER feel that Global Tiger Day is a tool to put the tiger in the people\'s consciousness and show them how this royal animal is fighting poachers, miners, farmers, climate change, deforestation, highways, politicians and the urban admirers.

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): On Global Tiger Day, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is urging tiger-range governments to strengthen anti-poaching efforts and crack down on a severe wildlife snaring crisis that is threatening wildlife across Asia, especially the world\'s remaining wild tigers, which number only around 3,900._line_In India, reported tiger deaths related to poaching reached an all time high in 2016. These reported figures might represent only a fraction of actual mortality. Electrocution and poisoning of the big cats have also been recorded across tiger habitats._line_With wildlife traps and electric wires embedded deep into the ground or hid among debris, the detection of these devices are often difficult and missed by forest guards who manually patrol our forests to ensure protection of our wildlife._line_Easy to make from widely available material such as bicycle cable wires and quick to set up, wire snares are deadly traps that are fast becoming the plague of Asia\'s forests._line_Driven by the growing illegal wildlife trade, which is now reaching an estimated USD 20 billion annually illegal wildlife trade is estimated to reach USD20 billion per year, which makes wildlife trafficking the world\'s fourth largest illicit trade, after narcotics, human trafficking and trade in counterfeit goods._line_"Snares are dangerous, insidious and quickly becoming a major contributor to the wave of extinction that is spreading throughout Southeast Asia - and tigers are being swept up in this crisis. All efforts to recover wild tigers are now imperiled by snaring on a massive scale. We cannot over emphasize the need for strong government commitment and investment in rangers who are on the frontline of conservation, clearing snares and apprehending those who set them," said Mike Baltzer, leader of WWF Tigers Alive._line_In the rare occasion that a wild tiger is able to escape a snare, it suffers debilitating injuries that prevent it from hunting, eventually causing it to die of starvation or infection._line_In addition, snares maim or kill any animal that activates them thus dealing a double blow to wild tigers, by trapping the prey base they need to survive and reproduce._line_"It\'s impossible to know how many snares are being set up every day, and threatening wildlife in these critical habitats. Hundreds of thousands of deadly snares are removed by rangers from Asia\'s protected areas annually, but this is just the tip of the iceberg," said Rohit Singh, wildlife law enforcement expert at WWF._line_Within the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the only place on Earth where wild tigers, orangutans, elephants and rhinos are found in the same habitat, snare traps are estimated to have doubled between 2006 and 2014. The number of snare traps in Sumatra recorded in 2013 and 2014 are doubled, when compared to the preceding eight years, suggesting a higher number of poachers in the area._line_Yet, many of such critical habitats lack adequate resources for protection. In nearby Rimbang Baling, one of several protected areas in Sumatra, only 26 rangers patrol over 1,400 square kilometres, an area equivalent to nearly twice the size of New York City._line_TRAFFIC India introduced Deep Search Metal Detectors (DSMD) in 2008 which have been distributed to Tiger Reserves across the country. The DSMDs help in detecting traps/snares, wires and other metal devices even buried up-to seven feet below the ground or debris._line_Local communities also play an integral role in the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. In India approximately 45 million people live in forest-fringe areas and more than 300 million people are dependent on forests for subsistence and cash livelihoods._line_Engagement of local communities is thus a key constituent in conservation efforts and can lead the way in helping reduce poaching and managing human-tiger interactions in the country._line_Speaking about the importance of community involvement to reduce poaching, Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, "WWF-India has been working with communities on holistic approaches to conservation. Making them primary stakeholders in the protection of forests and its wildlife can go a long way in enhancing anti-poaching efforts of the country."_line_In 2010, tiger range governments committed to the most ambitious conservation goal set for a single species - TX2, or the global goal to double wild tigers by 2022. Since 2016, the long trend of decline in global wild tiger numbers has halted for now and may even begin to rise, signaling a beacon of hope for global tiger conservation._line_Conservation organisations across the continent are calling for urgent action to build awareness and strengthen anti-poaching measures and reinforce investments in rangers, without which the poaching crisis will turn the trend back towards decline.

S'A new study by Qualtrics and Accel found that Millennials prefer digital communication. (Many even check their phones once per night.) Scientists know why, but do we really understand the benefits?_line_CREDIT: Getty Images_line_Has technology improved your life?_line_A new study this month found that over half (or 52%) of Millennials think technology has improved their relationships. And, 91% say they have a healthy relationship with tech. Interestingly enough, the same study found that most Boomers (57%) say tech has "ruined" relationships. The study by Qualtrics and Accel sheds new light on how tech plays a role in the daily lives of those 18 to 32 as opposed to older generations._line_A surprising stat from last year found that Millennials check their phone 150 times per day. What are they really trying to find out? What\'s the motivation? We\'ve known since at least 2012 that those text messages, social media posts, and emails all contribute to the release of dopamine in the human brain. (It\'s the same neurotransmitter that rewards you for accomplishing a goal.)_line_Scientists have wondered whether this is a terrible trend. Entire books have explained how an obsessive compulsion to read text messages and check your Twitter status have created zombies who can\'t really participate in discussions and can\'t look you in the eye for more than a second. Most of us have experienced that problem._line_The truth is a little more complicated, however._line_What the Qualtric and Accel survey reveals is that tech has, at least in the minds of Millennials, fostered better relationships both in daily life and at work. 73% of Millennials say tech has given them a better work-life balance, contributing to a better understanding on projects, for example, or building better friendships outside of work. In the same test group, which was about 8,000 respondents globally, only 47% of older generations said tech has given them a better work-life balance and improved relationships._line_I\'ve seen how this plays out firsthand many times. Working with Millennials is an interesting experience these days because they do not communicate as often by making phone calls or meeting in person. Yet, they communicate more often. You know what they\'re thinking and feeling, even if you\'re reading it on a screen._line_Tech has removed a barrier in relationships, lessened the delays in communication, and created a new forum for resolving conflict. We say Millennials do not have a "filter" but that has become a benefit in communication in many cases where they share true thoughts over text and on social media. It\'s not necessarily that Millennials are checked out or disinterested; in fact, they may be more clued in and more aware then ever._line_Of course, there\'s a downside._line_Dopamine can create a false sense of accomplishment. The Qualtrics study found that Millennials rarely go more than five hours during waking hours without checking their phone, which is a sign of addictive behavior. 79% keep a phone nearby when they sleep, and half check their phone in the middle of the night. Scientists know what\'s happening--it\'s a sense of euphoria you feel when someone comments on your Instagram photo, but that\'s not quite the same thing as landing a new job or getting a raise._line_There are warning signs when it comes to tech addiction, and it is a real problem. Yet, you could also say there is a shift in communication and it\'s creating better relationships that involve more communication and fewer barriers. I can text someone in seconds, but it take five minutes or more to make a phone call. As long as we understand the negatives (a false reward, not to mention a bright light shining up at your face all evening that turns you into an insomniac) it\'s possible that we\'re underestimating the benefits in this new form of communication. Tech does have benefits, as the study confirms._line_For most of us outside of this age group, there are a few implications. One is that we\'ll need to invest ourselves in how we develop relationships with Millennials. It means more Slack, fewer meetings. It means we might get a text in the wee hours of the night. It\'s a shift in how business communication has always worked, and the great irony here is that the Millennials are way ahead of us. They are seeing the benefits. Most of us are only seeing the downside--the inability to pay attention during a meeting._line_What\'s your view? Are the warning signs about addiction more serious than anyone realizes? Is the dopamine hit really a false reward? Or is this all leading to a better workplace where communication is better...and digitized?_line_Share your thoughts by email or on my Twitter feed._line_The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com._line_'

S' An unstable childhood could lead to harmful eating habits in adulthood, new research suggests. _line_According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity is a serious issue in the United States, impacting over one third of the adult population._line_The CDC also estimate that the yearly healthcare expenses of individuals living with obesity are more than $1,400 higher than those of people with a normal weight._line_Previous research has convincingly linked adult obesity with low socioeconomic status both in childhood and later in life._line_Now, a recent study from Florida State University in Tallahassee, in collaboration with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, goes beyond that._line_Dr. Jon K. Maner, from the Department of Psychology at Florida State University, and his colleagues have looked at how other destabilizing events from a person\'s childhood - such as exposure to divorce, crime, and other types of social and environmental instability - could lead to a lifestyle that promotes obesity._line_Their findings were recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences._line_Stable versus unstable childhoods_line_The researchers used "Life History Theory" (LHT), an analytical framework that, in a behavioral science context, places the amount of stability experienced in a person\'s childhood at the root of their lifestyle and life choices, or "life-history strategies."_line_LHT signals two kinds of life-history strategies: faster life-history strategies and slower life-history strategies. Faster life-history strategies are marked by the search for immediate gratification, such as having more sexual partners in early life, having more children earlier, and exhibiting a generally impulsive behavior._line_According to LHT, people with faster life-history strategies are likely to have had unstable childhoods, in which they were exposed to privations of one kind or another. This is why, later in life, they are prone to favor "living in the moment," without adequately planning for the future._line_"Experiencing an unpredictable environment in childhood sensitizes people to the idea that it\'s difficult to plan for the future because if you don\'t know what\'s around the next corner, you live for the now. They end up focusing on short-term rather than long-term goals and they\'re not good at delaying gratification."_line_Dr. Jon K. Maner_line_At the opposite side of the spectrum, people with slower life-history strategies are likely to have had very stable and well-structured childhoods, which led them to expect a stable future._line_Slower life-history strategies are focused on long-term outcome behaviors characterized by more cautious deliberation._line_Slow life-history strategy more healthful_line_Despite previous research pointing to links between childhood stress and adult obesity, this is the first time that LHT has been used to explain behaviors that lead to an unhealthful diet._line_Dr. Maner and his colleagues looked at how lack of stability in childhood can be a predictor of behaviors that lead to obesity in adulthood._line_The study found a direct link between fast life-history strategies and eating habits that can lead to obesity. The researchers observed that people with more instinct-driven life choices were much likelier to eat even when they were not hungry._line_"If you don\'t know where the next meal is coming from, it would make sense to eat what you can now. But people with a slow-life-history strategy [...] are inclined to listen to their body and eat based on their current needs," says Dr. Maner._line_This is why the study is important, in the researchers\' view: it allows people to identify the root of their bad dietary practices, and it may educate parents on how best to adapt their behavior to ensure their children\'s well-being later in life._line_"Our research suggests it\'s not just about reducing stress, it\'s more about creating structure and predictability for children," explains Dr. Maner._line_"Routines teach children to have expectations that, when met, result in a sense of certainty and structure. Theoretically, that feeling of predictability instills a slower-life-history strategy, which may reduce obesity in adulthood."_line_Dr. Jon K. Maner_line_'

S'A quick top level update on the Russian economy from Bofit and Fitch Ratings._line_Fitch Ratings today:_line_"The recovery in Russia continues to gain traction. Domestic demand is responding to greater confidence in the economic policy framework, particularly as the inflation-targeting regime becomes entrenched. Activity in Turkey has bounced back rapidly from the coup attempt, with growth hitting 5% yoy in 1Q17. Momentum was supported by government incentives, including temporary fiscal measures and a jump in the Treasury commitment to the fund that backs lending to SMEs."_line_Chart from BOFIT confirms the above:_line_Overall, the recovery is still on track, and remains gradual at best, posing elevated risks of reversals. For example, industrial output, having previously posted gains in January-May 2017, contracted in June 2017 on a quarterly basis. Still, industrial output was up 2% in 1H 2017 y/y. Despite the U.S. and European sanctions, and generally adverse trends in the commodities sectors, mineral extraction sector expanded 3% y/y in 1H 2017, according to BOFIT. Oil output was up 2% and gas output was up 13%. The above figures imply that higher value added manufacturing posted sub-1% y/y growth in 1H 2017._line_Agricultural production was basically flat - due, in part, to poor weather conditions, rising only 0.2% y/y in 1H 2017 and unlikely to post significant growth for FY2017 as crop reports are coming in relatively weak. That said, 2015-2016 saw record crops and very strong growth in agricultural output, so barring a major decline this year, agricultural sector activity will remain robust. Food production sector was the fourth highest growth sector over the 2013-1H 2017 period across the entire Russian economy, rising cumulative 17% in 1H 2017 compared to 1H 2013 in real (inflation-adjusted) terms._line_Construction sector posted a robust 4-5 percent expansion in 1H 2017 compered to 1H 2016, a rather positive sign of improving investment._line_Pharmaceuticals (+36%), plastics (+25%), chemical industry (+22%), paper industry (+19%) were the main sectors of positive growth over 2013-2017 period, according to data compiled by Rossstat._line_Really good news is that household demand is now recovering. Retail sales by volume were up ca 1% y/y on a seasonally-adjusted basis and real disposable household income rose from the cycle lows to the levels last seen in May-June 2016. Bad news is that with income growth slower than retail sales and even slower than actual household consumption (which grew faster than domestic retail sales due to accelerating purchases abroad), Russian households are dipping into savings and credit to fund consumption increases._line_We shall wait until July 2017 PMI figures come out over the next few days to see more current trends in the Russian economy, but overall, all signs point to a moderate 1H and 3Q (ongoing) expansion in the economy, consistent with 1.2-1.3% real growth. The Economy Ministry recently reiterated its view that Russian GDP will expand at more than 2% rate in 2017. Achieving this will clearly require a large and accelerated cut in the central bank rate from current 9% to below 8%. Even with this, it is hard to see how above-2% growth can be achieved._line_Agricultural and food production are quite significant variable in the growth equation. In 2016, Russia became number one exporter of wheat in the world, with annual production tipping 120 million tons - historical record. Bad weather conditions in 2017 mean that current expected output is estimated at around 17% below 2016 levels. Russia consumes 70 percent of its wheat output internally, so cuts to exports are likely to be on the magnitude of 1/2 or more in 2017. Domestically, food price inflation is rising this year, threatening overall central bank target and putting pressure on CBR to stay out of cutting the key policy rate. Inflation rose in June to 4.4% - moderate by historical standards, but above 4% CBR target._line_'

S"Image Credit: Sebastian Blanco_line_  2018 Volt _line_Image Credit: Sebastian Blanco_line_General Motors is apparently considering killing off six slow-selling models by 2020, according to Reuters. But is that really likely? The news is mentioned in a story where UAW president Dennis Williams notes that slumping US car sales could threaten jobs at low-volume factories. Still, we're skeptical that GM is really serious about killing those cars._line_Reuters specifically calls out the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Sonic, and the Chevrolet Volt. Most of these have been redesigned or refreshed within the past few model years. Four - the LaCrosse, Impala, CT6, and Volt - are built in the Hamtramck factory in Detroit. That plant has made only 35,000 cars this year - down 32 percent from 2016. A typical GM plant builds 200,000-300,000 vehicles a year._line_ Of all the cars Williams listed, killing the XTS, Impala, and Sonic make the most sense. They're older and don't sell particularly well. On the other hand, axing the other three seems like an odd move. It would leave Buick and Cadillac without flagship sedans, at least until the rumored Cadillac CT8 arrives. The CT6 was a big investment for GM and backing out after just a few years would be a huge loss. It also uses GM's latest and best materials and technology, making us even more skeptical._line_ The Volt is a hugely important car for Chevrolet, and supplementing it with a crossover makes more sense than replacing it with one. Offering one model with a range of powertrain variants like the Hyundai Ioniq and Toyota Prius might be another route GM could take._line_ All six of these vehicles are sedans, Yes, crossover sales are booming, but there's still a huge market for cars. Backing away from these would be essentially giving up sales to competitors from around the globe. The UAW might simply be publicly pushing GM to move crossover production to Hamtramck to avoid closing the plant and laying off workers._line_Sales of passenger cars are down across both GM and the industry. Consolidating production in other plants and closing Hamtramck rather than having a single facility focus on sedans might make more sense from a business perspective. GM is also trying to reduce its unsold inventory, meaning current production may be slowed or halted while current cars move into customer hands._line_ There's a lot of politics that goes into building a car. GM wants to do what makes the most sense from a business perspective, while the UAW doesn't workers to lose their jobs when a factory closes. When these two desires don't line up, there's always a lot of rumors, and speculation. For now, the automaker is remaining mum on its future products, as we'd expect._line_"

S'New Delhi, Jul 29 (PTI) She is known for being one of the fittest and most stylish divas in Bollywood but Shilpa Shetty Kundra said there was a time when she was not sure of her fashion choices and made a lot of mistakes. _line_The actress, who was in the capital to walk for designer Monisha Jaising at FDCI India Couture Week, said her style has evolved over the years and now she only believes in creating her own statement rather than following any trend blindly. _line_"I try to do different stuff and I think thats the common thread between Monisha and me. Also, she likes to be a trendsetter and not a trend follower and I totally understand it. So, Ill rather not do what somebody has done and than follow that trend blindly. _line_"Style has to be very personal. And Ive made a lot of mistakes in my career. But you learn. And experience is something that cannot be brought. I love the fact that Ive learnt from my own mistakes as it has made me wiser," Shilpa told reporters post the fashion show here. _line_Donning an exquisite silk brocade gown with golden weaves, Shilpa looked stunning as she strutted her beauty at the ramp. _line_"I think this is (dress) like a take on the Indian sari. They used brocade and they modernised it. I love Indian attires especially the saris so much. You can do so much with it and the most beautiful aspect about the sari is that its timeless and will never go out of style. It can make a statement anywhere." _line_However, the thigh-high slit outfit landed her in a spot of bother after its lengthy train got stuck on the ramp. But, Shilpa said such things were normal. _line_"The ramp had a couple of nails so the thing got stuck but I think it happens. The beauty of this garment is that it just got that spring in my steps and I was like, Yes here I am, and then that nail was trying to get me down. But I enjoyed doing this. _line_"I think at the end of it all, you have to look great in what you wearing and people should like it. I feel great in this piece." _line_Inspired by the Opera, Monishas collection, harmonised with the evolution of displaying ones finery and the mesmerising dynamics of performance on stage. _line_"What I wanted to show in this dress was a western style which was the Opera. You can be in any part of the world if youre wearing this piece. And I wanted an Indian girl with an international feel. So, I wanted to use Shilpa in the Indian fabric and drape her in this modern gown," the designer said. _line_The collection set the stage with a theatrical variation of fabrics composed of velvet metallics, tulle, chikankari, Italian organza, banarasi, metallic satin and much more. _line_With a dramatic ethnic flair infused with contemporary details, the assortment of pieces featured lehengas, evening dresses, cocktail saris, evening gowns, crop tops and ball skirts.

S'Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, teamed up with colleagues from the Harvard Business School in Boston, MA, to try to answer the question, "Can money buy us happiness?"_line_Dr. Ashley Whillans, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, and her colleagues found that money does buy happiness when it is invested in time-saving expenses, such as hiring a cleaner or a nanny._line_The results of the study were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences._line_According to studies from across the globe, researchers note that in countries where personal income is on the rise, free time has become something of a luxury. Lack of free time is reportedly responsible for a decreased sense of well-being, susceptibility to anxiety, and insomnia._line_With this in mind, Dr. Whillans and her colleagues set out to test whether or not spending money to acquire more time - by hiring someone to help with household duties and any unpleasant chores, for example - could positively impact people\'s lives._line_Time-saving investments bring happiness_line_They initially analyzed data sourced from 4,469 respondents from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United States._line_In the U.S., they reviewed information from 366 freelancers who sourced their work using a major online platform, as well as 1,260 regular working U.S. adults, who were representative of the general population._line_In Denmark, the data came from 467 representative workers, and in Canada, they were collected from a similar population sample of 326 respondents. From the Netherlands, they evaluated 1,232 nationally representative workers, as well as a population of 818 millionaires._line_All the respondents at this stage had to provide information about any money they spent on a regular basis to hire helpers and free up time for themselves._line_The researchers found that more than 28 percent of the participants invested money in time-saving expenses each month. These respondents also reported feeling happier and more satisfied with their lives._line_What surprised Dr. Whillans and her colleagues was that the same degree of satisfaction was felt by people who invested in domestic help regardless of their personal income._line_"The benefits of buying time aren\'t just for wealthy people. We thought the effects might only hold up for people with quite a bit of disposable income, but to our surprise, we found the same effects across the income spectrum," says senior author Dr. Elizabeth Dunn, from the University of British Columbia._line_Few people buy time out_line_Dr. Whillans and her team sought to consolidate their results by recruiting a further 1,802 U.S. participants, to whom they rephrased their initial questions so that "time-saving investments" would be defined less restrictively. Their initial findings still held._line_Finally, the researchers also decided to conduct a field experiment, in which 60 working adults from Canada were randomly allocated $40 for two consecutive weekends. They were then asked to spend this money first on time-saving investments, and then on a material purchase._line_It was found that the participants felt happier at the weekend when they had invested the money on help with chores, which allowed them to have more free time._line_However, the researchers were in for another surprise when they noticed that relatively few people, even counting those with significant expendable incomes, chose to spend their money on time-freeing purchases._line_Out of the 818 Dutch millionaires that they surveyed, a little less than half declared that they never invested in purchases that allowed them to avoid unpleasant and time-consuming chores._line_When they asked a further sample of 98 working adults how they would spend an expendable $40, only 2 percent of them reported that they would invest in free time._line_Dr. Whillans suggests that we should try thinking about our investments differently, and buy ourselves more time when we can._line_"Lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences."_line_Dr. Elizabeth Dunn_line_'

That's it!_line_Let's say you're cooking farro. Bring a big pot of water to a boil, like you would with pasta. Salt it if you want. Get some farro\xe2\x80\x94no need to measure it. Just use however much you think you want. Add it to the pot of boiling water._line_Keeping the pot at a pretty brisk boil, cook the farro until it's done, and then drain it through a fine-mesh sieve. How do you know it's done? You taste it. Does it taste good\xe2\x80\x94tender, yet still on the al dente side? Bam: done. Obviously this method requires a little more supervision than the cover-and-steam method, but in my opinion it more than makes up for that by giving you complete control over the process\xe2\x80\x94you'll never again take the lid off your pot of rice and find yourself surprised that it's under- or overcooked._line_"

S" Medical specialists, researchers and doctors are constantly in search of better and more improved treatments for the numerous disorders and diseases that affect people. Extensive research and studies are being carried out to find new and innovative techniques for the treatment of diseases ever since medical science became organized. _line_Stem cell therapy and research have provided a commendable breakthrough that has brought a bright ray of hope for people suffering from severe and hitherto untreatable diseases. _line_What are stem cells? _line_Stem cells are the basic template cells that are found in the bone marrow. These cells later develop into different types of cells that are required in the body, such as brain cells, blood cells, bone cells and cells that compose of the heart tissue. In ideal conditions, stem cells divide to form various types of cells, often referred to as 'daughter cells'. _line_Where are stem cells found? _line_Stem cell research shows that there are different sources where stem cells initially develop, including: _line_Embryonic stem cells: _line_An embryo, which is 3 to 5 days old, begins to produce stem cells. The embryo, which is called a 'blastocyst' at this stage, contains an average of 150 cells. These pluripotent (divisible) stem cells have the ability to integrate into other type of cells. The versatile nature of embryonic stem cells allows them to be used for generating cells that help to repair or regenerate disease-affected tissues and organs. _line_Adult stem cells: _line_Small number of these stem cells are found in most of the adult tissues, including the bone marrow and fat. Comparatively, adult stem cells have limited ability to regenerate different types of cells. Earlier, it was believed that adult stem cells, in the bone marrow, gave rise to only blood cells which have now been debunked by extensive research. _line_Stem cell therapy and research show that adult stem cells not only help to generate blood cells but are also useful for creating heart and bone cells. _line_Perinatal stem cells: _line_Research into stem cells has shown that stem cells are also found in the amniotic fluid, which is a component of the umbilical cord. These cells have the ability to change into various other types of cells in the body. _line_Additional research is currently underway to determine the benefits of perinatal stem cells. _line_Benefits of stem cells _line_Human development: _line_Stem cell therapy has a huge potential for treating numerous physiological and neurological disorders and diseases. Stem cells are being increasingly used for the treatment of congenital (birth) defects as these diseases are known to be caused due to an insufficient differentiation process of cells. _line_Additional research, on these stem cells, will help to find most effective uses (of stem cells) for the betterment of various diseases. _line_Treatment therapies: _line_As stem cells have the ability to form other cells and tissues, it is likely to replace the 'organ donation' and organ transplant method. As an organ donation and implant process is long and complicated, stem cell therapy can efficiently help to replace the infected tissues and cells which can effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality rate associated with serious health conditions, including:_line_Type 1 diabetes_line_Parkinson's disease_line_Arthritis_line_Cardiovascular diseases_line_Severe burn treatments_line_Reversing diseases: _line_By stimulating the differentiation process of stem cells, the possibility to generate cells, required to replace the diseased cells, is larger now. _line_Stem cell therapy and research are proving to be a new frontier in medicine and health all over the world. Reputed healthcare institutes like NeuroGen Brain and Spine Institute are providing the best stem cell therapy and treatment for various neurological diseases. _line_"

S" First impression matters a lot in the business world. You should be aware of this important fact and dress properly. Corporate uniforms or business attire has been there in the business world for many years. But there have been a lot of changes in the last 20 years and it is good for the business. Styles and designs have changed keeping in mind the taste of today's world. But the big question is why formal attire or corporate wear is so important for the growth of business? The most important reason why corporate wear is so important for a company is because it gives a clear message that you are dedicated to your company and position in which you are working.

The biggest advantage is that all the employees feel equal in formal attire and this sense of equality boosts confidence and spreads professionalism in the organization. The idea of professionalism varies from company to company. But the correlation between the two is generally strong. Some business organizations prefer to allow employees to dress freely or casually for more comfort, which works well in more creative work environments such as advertising agencies. However, companies in which employees routinely interact with prospects, clients and business partners on a daily basis typically need a dress code to maintain a professional image and showcase their brand. In real estate, employees dress in formal attire to represent their company and also sell their brand well in the targeted market. Corporate wear encourages positivity and also create good vibes not only in the company but also instills faith in the clients. If you are able to build faith in the clients, then it will result in more business for you._line_If you are looking for corporate attire for your company, then you should shop online.

No, not the Twilight Zone\xe2\x80\x94early spring. The thought of fresh fruit is so ripe in my mind I can taste it, but the farmers market is still bare. It's the perfect excuse for a bit of spring cleaning, a baking spree to polish off the last of the frozen fruit I squirrel away every summer. _line_Now, you can make a lot of desserts with frozen fruit, but my favorite option is pie. Despite what you might have read elsewhere, frozen fruit isn't any juicier than fresh, so it doesn't take any special precautions to prepare. There's no need to drain off the juices or add extra starch\xe2\x80\x94simply thaw to about 50\xc2\xb0F (10\xc2\xb0C), and prepare the pie filling as directed. _line_The frozen fruit will deflate and release its water content as it thaws, so it will seem juicier. But looks can be deceiving. It's the same amount of liquid you'd find in fresh fruit; it just shows up a lot earlier in the process. That does give the pie filling a denser, jammier vibe\xe2\x80\x94compared to a pie made with plump fresh fruits that wilt and release their juices only after spending some time in the oven\xe2\x80\x94but it doesn't mean pies made with frozen fruit will be a soupy mess._line_On the left, a pie made with fresh cherries; on the right, a pie made with frozen cherries._line_The only thing to keep in mind when baking a pie with frozen fruit is that it may warrant an extra 10 or 15 minutes in the oven, unless you thaw the fruit all the way to room temperature. For that reason, I don't like to egg-wash frozen-fruit pies, as that extra time in the oven can lead to excessive browning, even with a foil shield. _line_On the plus side, more time in the oven generally translates into an even crispier bottom crust\xe2\x80\x94at least with my pie dough recipe, which is high in both butter and water, factors that help the crust crisp, puff, and resist absorbing moisture from the filling. Low-fat and/or low-moisture pie doughs tend to be thirsty, meaning they're more inclined to soak up a juicy filling, particularly when the dough is raw. With some doughs, that means baking with frozen fruit can lead to a soggy crust, so you may want to consider switching to a richer, more hydrated dough for the occasion._line_So join me in the middle ground between science and superstition, between the (cherry) pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge\xe2\x80\x94frozen fruit in a fresh-baked pie._line_"

S'Spread across 285 acres of green and incredibly biodiverse land, the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve is located in Sungam hills, between Nelliyampathy and Anamalai ranges. While the Nelliyampathy hills are not very high and are only visible from the northern part of the reserve, the peaks in Anamalai hills go as high as 1,438m. These include Karimala Gopuram, Vengoli Malai, Puliyarapadam and Pandaravarai._line_The Parambikulam Tiger Reserve was established in the 1960s. The forests were heavily exploited for their vast reserves of timber in the early 1900s. However, in the 1950s, the government of the newly independent state of India, Kerala, abolished the tramways that had been set up by the British for easier transport of teak. The government also prohibited tree-cutting. Today, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve is a highly protected forest area._line_The main attraction here, for which most tourists make the long trip to the sanctuary, are the big cats \xe2\x80\x93 leopards and tigers. Not everyone gets a glimpse of these glorious jungle cats, although, on rare occasions, they are known to pop by the small coffee shop near the Parambikulam bus stand to reveal themselves to the loud and colourful human beings. But for those who are spared of this hair-raising, highly adrenaline-pumping experience, other mammals such as bears, elephants, macaques and flying squirrels make the experience of tourists worthwhile._line_The sanctuary also attracts over 120 kinds of butterflies, of which 34 are endemic to the region, and 134 species of birds, of which 18 are endangered. Neem, teak and sandalwood trees populate most of the forests. The oldest tree here is the majestic Kannimara Teak, believed to be 450 years old. This abundant and thriving population of flora and fauna in the sanctuary co-exists peacefully with the four indigenous tribes: Kadar, Malasar, Mala Malasar and Muduvar._line_A machan inside the reserve_line_ORIENTATION_line_Parambikulam Tiger Reserve lies south of the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, between the hills of Anamalai and Nelliyampathy. Its altitude ranges from 980\xe2\x80\x934,600ft. The sanctuary has no direct roads connecting it with towns in Kerala, and must be accessed from Pollachi in Tamil Nadu. There is a certain amount of grunt work involved in getting here, as tourists will have to negotiate with the forest departments of both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The latter manage the Indira Gandhi National Park at Anamalai (Entry Rs. 15), which has to be navigated to get to Parambikulam. The Annapadi checkpost, 10km from the Anamalai Sanctuary, marks the transition from Tamil Nadu to Kerala, and the beginning of the Parambikulam reserve area._line_THINGS TO SEE AND DO_line_Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary_line_Tourism at the sanctuary is carefully monitored and visitors are only allowed inside with an experienced forest guide. Eco-tourism activities in Parambikulam include night-stays, trekking, camps and nature-education trails. All of these are organised by the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. Contact the Forest Information or Wildlife Interpretation Centre at Annapadi for guides._line_It is a good idea to get there as early as possible, as animals are most active at this time of the day. One should also ideally come in a vehicle, as moving around on foot is difficult inside the park._line_It is possible to stay within the sanctuary. The reserve offers a large number of accommodation options, which are basic. However, staying here for a night is quite a wonderful experience; wild animals come out to drink on the far side of the lake in the evenings.

S'Ciaran McMeeken had more than 50 songs to choose from when he started recording his self-titled debut album._line_Ciaran McMeeken, a great southern man from Arrowtown, can thank the owner of a farm in Owaka Valley for encouraging him to pursue his musical dreams._line_While working for the farmer, named John, in 2013, his boss asked him what he wanted to do with his life. McMeeken didn\'t have an answer at the time, to which the response was "just get on with it mate". Two EPS later and now with the release of his self-titled debut album, McMeeken has done just that._line_ What are you plugging right now? _line_I am all set to release my debut full-length album, and for the first time I\'m actually really excited about it! I have been working on this album for more than two-and-a-half years and wrote more than 50 songs, so it feels really good to be finally sharing it with the world._line_In the past I\'ve been rather nervous about releasing music and what people are going to think and all that usual stuff. With this album, however, I feel really at ease with it all. I feel really confident and I believe whole-heartedly that we have put together a really awesome collection of songs that touch on all different facets and emotions of life. I\'m really proud of it._line_I remember a few months back trying to come up with an album name. I had options such as Which Way Shall We Go? (which I liked), I had Rhino Peak (which I have now called my business) and I even went as far as seriously considering Eat The Strawberries as a possible name. I called up my dad one afternoon and he completely pulled me back down to earth and said: "Ciaran, I have listened to this album countless times now and these songs are so dynamic and diverse that you can\'t possibly call the album anything. No title can possibly encapsulate these songs that you have written. Keep it really simple mate, You have written these songs, put an image of your face as the artwork and call it Ciaran McMeeken. Done." _line_Thanks Dad, I\'ll do just that. There\'s nothing like a grounded conversation with the old man to set things straight._line_READ MORE:_line_How did you initially get involved in music and how long have you been part of it? _line_I initially got into music when I was 11. In 2003 I moved from Arrowtown to Dunedin with my family and attended Balmacewen Intermediate. At the time I was heavily into sports, particularly athletics and rugby._line_Balmacewen have a policy where every student must learn to play a musical instrument, so I decided on drums. I loved it and picked it up quickly. I was lucky to be in a class with two lads, Innes and Conall (Hearty Irish names) who happened to play bass and guitar. We started hanging out and playing music together, mainly Nirvana and Guns N\' Roses covers._line_A year later my parents bought me an acoustic guitar and a boy called Patrick (adding to the Irish flavour) joined the band as the drummer. So this was the band moving forward and we played together throughout high school, won school battle of the bands and entered Rockquests etc._line_I also spent a lot of time playing in a country duo, a reggae band and also busking with a friend over Christmas. This was the foundation of my music life. _line_What\'s your idea of perfect happiness?_line_For me perfect happiness is when I know deep within myself that I am enough and I am worthy at every moment of every day in any situation. Not relying on external things or sources to fill a void within. At the moment I am practising meditating, focusing on the positive and breaking down barriers that have been in the way of living an extraordinary, epic life!_line_Which living person do you most admire?_line_Jack Johnson. I admire him for the success he has achieved in his music career but also for what he is doing in the community. He is heavily involved with charities, fundraising events, and projects to do with the environment. He also has awesome initiatives on his world tours opting for plastic free, supporting local food and using sustainable bio-diesel for the trucks they use etc! It\'s bloody awesome and something I am working towards for myself!_line_What\'s your most embarrassing moment?_line_My most embarrassing moment is most likely not appropriate for publication but my close second would be getting stage fright at an open mic in Sydney a few years ago. I was so nervous, bright red, sweaty and shaky but somehow managed to stumble my way through Skinny Love. After I finished the song, someone yelled out "Boooooo!". I walked off stage feeling like a piece of crap. The worst part is that it was all being filmed by some students for a community project and they wanted to do an interview straight afterward. So with a camera pointed at my shiny, awkward face the first question they asked was, "So how was that? How are you feeling?". I remember being totally honest and saying something along the lines of "that was one of the worst moments of my life"._line_Ever stolen anything? _line_Yes, I stole a George Foreman grill and Ministry of Sound CD from a flat party once. I\'m deeply ashamed of that._line_What do you most dislike about your appearance?_line_If I\'m totally honest, I have a hairy back of my neck. I\'m really self-conscious of it and I shave it every day! The thought of going tramping for a week without a razor actually gives me anxiety! Crazy! It\'s just blimmin\' hair for goodness sake!_line_What life lesson would you pass on to your children?_line_The power of vulnerability. I will really instil into them that it is OK to be lost, depressed, jealous or insecure. It\'s OK to feel anything. You have to lean into the discomfort and communicate whatever it is you are feeling. I truly believe the reason we have such a high suicide rate in this country is because most of us don\'t have tools to communicate or listen properly. All we really need emotionally, as human beings, are to be seen, heard, accepted and not judged. To be able to put your hand up to a friend or family member and actually say. "Hey, I\'m feeling really insecure, anxious and depressed at the moment", takes incredible courage. What we then need is for the friend or partner to say, "Thank you so much for being authentic with me, I love you and I\'m totally and utterly here for you." This type of communication is very rare and is something that needs education and attention in our schools, community groups, and families. For me, I have been really fortunate to have had such supportive parents. When I went through a deep depression about four years ago, they were there for me. I learned a lot from songwriting and expressing my thoughts and feelings through writing and music. It was a huge help to me. I have now learned to do that in conversations with friends and family, which keeps me healthy and allows me to function in this world._line_How do you balance music with other obligations \xe2\x80\x93 partner, children, job? _line_Well at the moment I don\'t have any of those things. In my past relationships, I have definitely found myself out of balance from time to time and it\'s something I am aware of and working on. Pursuing a life in music really is a huge commitment. I absolutely love it. There are just a lot of sacrifices and compromises that need to be made to make it work. For example, I have missed out on countless trips away with family and friends because I need to save money for music stuff or I have a tour etc. Having a career in music is like having a child, you really have to look after it and give it a huge portion of your time and energy to enable it to survive and grow. _line_What do you do to relax? _line_I love to go running to clear the lungs and mind. It keeps me sane. I love to practice yoga too, it really centres me, leaving my mind and body feeling clear and free. I also love to read and cook healthy vegan food._line_What job would you do other than your own and why?_line_I\'d be a healthy food critic. I\'d be paid to fly around the world visiting healthy and organic cafes/restaurants and try all of their awesome food. I don\'t know if this exists but I\'d make it work somehow._line_'

S"Ending on a high note. _line_Punjabi food, like its culture, is very hard to ignore especially in Amritsar, the golden heart of the land of butter and celebration. The flavours are just like its people, loud and in your face but in a very good way. We went on a food adventure spanning over three days in the land of the gurus and stuffed our faces with the most beautiful, delicious and rich dishes we could find on the streets of Amritsar. Read about day 1 here and day 2 here._line_Day 3_line_Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It is something we have all been taught. And so we took it literally with some authentic Amritsari kulchas. We started with Kulwant Kulcha. The place is ideal for those who like their kulcha really flaky, crisp and lightly spiced. Then there is All India Famous Kulcha Wala, which has been in business since 1989. The shop is owned by Sucha Singh ji and is managed by his son Ponty Singh. The kulcha dough is rolled into seven layers and then stuffed with aloo and paneer filling and half cooked. When someone places the order, the cook handling the tandoor applies water on one side and sticks it in the tandoor. Like Kulwant's this kulcha was flaky, crisp and subtly spiced. They also have another outlet called Kulchaland which has a more restaurant-like setup. But for me, Ashok Kulche Wala rules the Amritsari Kulcha chart with perfect spicing putting its offerings a cut above the rest (I've already described it in some detail here). One can walk in to his open kitchen and see the steps involved in making a perfect kulcha. This is what I liked best about Amritsar. The people here are open hearted and there are no secrets\xe2\x80\x94one can easily walk in to any restaurant's kitchen. Amritsaris love feeding people and the owners themselves are involved in cooking._line_ The people here are open hearted and there are no secrets\xe2\x80\x94one can easily walk in to any restaurant's kitchen. _line_Next up was Surjit Food Plaza at Nehru Shopping Complex, Lawrence Road. An interesting thing about Amritsar's food joints is that though some look quite modern and fancy, the food they serve is authentic and traditional. From the outside, Surjit looks like the kind of place I can't usually afford, but the food has not lost its Amritsari soul. I asked for tawa chicken pulao, which I could see being prepped from behind a big glass wall by none other than the owner, Amarjit Singh. He mixed ghee as well as butter into the chicken and then added boiled rice into the mixture. The tawa chicken pulao is garnished with ginger and coriander. The flavourful rice balances the soft pieces of chicken.They have served their food to who's who of India. They even have a picture album which one can ask for to see the pictures of celebrities dining at the restaurant. But what caught my attention was the modest beginnings of the restaurant. Starting from a small khopcha, it is full-fledged restaurant today with modern facilities._line_A foodie friend, Girish, sends me screenshots of food joints on WhatsApp all the time, often giving me valuable leads. While I was in Amritsar, he sent a screenshot of Giani Tea Stall, established in 1955. The place is famous for its breakfast dishes, especially kachoris, but since I couldn't make it in time for a morning meal I had to satisfy myself with an omelette and special spiced tea. The tea maker, Ajay, who hails from Pathankot has been working at Giani's for 15 years. I tried the spiced tea with saffron, cardamom and almonds (\xe2\x82\xb935 per cup). Next time, when I visit I will make it a point to start my day with his kachoris._line_On the recommendation of another recommendation, we went to Pal Dhaba near Hathi Gate for lunch. We tried magaz, kharode and mutton tikka. The dishes were similar to what we had at Prakash (see here) but super delicious. The kharode, in particular, amazed me. Unlike the soupy Delhi variety, it was thick and unctuous. The pieces of goat feet are boiled in water and then added to a stock-based gravy later. It's delicious with tandoori rotis. On the table next to us, a group of people from Delhi were having mutton tikka with buttery white sesame naan. I couldn't resist ordering the same dish. The mutton tikka is again cooked in spices and served in thick gravy. The naan is so delicious that it can be savoured alone without any sauce or curry._line_This was exactly what we were exactly waiting for\xe2\x80\x94a high note with which to end our amazing food journey. Needless to say we'll be going back for more._line_"

S"Bacon is traditionally cooked in an oven, over the stovetop, or in a microwave, but what happens when you air-fry it? Air-what, you may be thinking? Air-frying is exactly as the name sounds. An appliance about the size of a slow cooker contains a drawer with a metal mesh bottom for the food. The appliance blows hot, dry air on food to fry it with little to no oil. This trend took 2016 by storm thanks to celebrity endorsements from Gordon Ramsay, Paula Deen, and Oprah Winfrey, so what's the dang fuss all about? I busted out a Philips Digital Airfryer ($250) and a package of bacon to find out. _line_Having no clue how to air-fry, I watched a YouTube video on how to air-fry bacon and followed these instructions. However, I ended up with steamed bacon once the cook time was complete. It resembled deli ham more than bacon, and the fat from the bacon turned translucent and gelatinous. Perhaps this is the preferred method to cook bacon in Europe, but for me, I like my bacon crispy. So I cranked up the heat and kept cooking, shaking the basket occasionally and tripling the cook time, until I ended up with perfectly caramelized strips. I'm talking evenly cooked with no burn spots. Bacon never looked better._line_But looks can be deceiving; the taste test would reveal the bacon's true tastiness or not. Remarkably, the bacon had a thin, crisp exterior that yielded to a fatty, chewy interior. I've never had bacon quite like this. The bacon also retained its size prior to cooking and did not shrink at all. The cleanup was a breeze too. I poured the extra bacon grease into a dish for later (it too was pure fat with no black char bits that you find when cooking bacon in an oven or on a stovetop) and proceeded to scrub down the drawer, which proved to be an easy feat._line_Feeling confident about my air-frying skills, I proceeded to attempt apple chips and failed horribly. I mean, the apple chips burned and stuck into every crevice of the grid bottom. It was a nightmare to clean up with no reward of apple chips at the end. I know there's a learning curve to a new cooking device, so I'll try again. I'm dying to learn how to make french fries and fried chicken. Those will be my next attempts!_line_"

S'Representative image_line_ JAIPUR: Important safety arrangements were not made by the IIS University administration during the mountaineering trials held for students to witness adventure sports on July 26. A 19-year-old girl had slipped to death from the university\'s roof which prompted cops to file an FIR against the university and the instructor. _line_ The lapses in safety were brought to light during police investigation, ACP Mansarovar, Deshraj Yadav said that cops will also issue a notice to the university and asked them to explain the safety arrangements being made. _line_  "There should have been a safety net, ambulances and fire tenders present on the spot. Our investigation suggests no such arrangements were made on that day," Yadav said. _line_ The cops said they have found \'glaring negligence\' on account of the university and trainer Sunil Sanghi. On the morning of July 26, 19-year-old Aditi Sanghi lost her balance and fell from the sixth floor of the building. She was among several students gathered to witness trials for the mountaineering sport. The girl\'s father, Sunil Sanghi, himself was training the students when the mishap took place. _line_ The cops inspected the university and found that lives of many students were risked as they were allowed to stand on the roof of the university. "The height of the roof\'s wall was merely one feet. There were no railings either, imagine if there was a stampede, many more students would have died or sustained severe injuries," added police official. _line_  The university also failed to inform government authorities about the training session being organized at the university campus. "As per the rules, ambulance and fire officials should have been deployed inside the university campus when the accident took place," Yadav added. The Jaipur police have already filed an FIR against administration and Sunil Sanghi under sections 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence). _line_Bookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. _line_'

S'The women in the movie may be strong and funny when they are in their secret lives but they make almost no push for empowerment in their oppressive lives._line_A still from Lipstick Under My Burkha. Credit: YouTube_line_That Lipstick Under My Burkha is a \xe2\x80\x9cbold\xe2\x80\x9d film in the Indian context is incontestable. It shows women looking for sex, enjoying it, looking for freedom from oppression, looking to be able to smoke and drink freely, looking for the chance to earn a living and be good at it. What\xe2\x80\x99s to carp about?_line_Barring the film certification board\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre comments on the film, which have been repeated endlessly but need to be repeated again and again to see how monumentally foolish they are, the film has got accolades and awards. The film certification board, led by the fearlessly patriarchal Pahlaj Nihalani, denied the film release in January this year because: \xe2\x80\x9cThe story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contagious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society.\xe2\x80\x9d_line_The reviewers have called it a \xe2\x80\x9cmust watch\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cholding a mirror to society\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cfearlessly feminist\xe2\x80\x9d. Certainly, there is much to agree. The acting is good, sometimes excellent. The direction by Alankrita Shrivastava (who has also written the film) has both humour and pathos, without overwhelming the viewer._line_But what does the story itself tell us that is fearlessly feminist or all about women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment?_line_As a feminist statement, it is something of a tragedy. All the four women pursue their dreams \xe2\x80\x93 whatever they may be \xe2\x80\x93 in secret. Whether it is Usha Buaji (Ratna Pathak-Shah, who is the shining light of the film with her deft touch), and her sexual awakening at 55 or young Rehana (Plabita Borthakur) trying to get out of the burkha insisted on by her parents and into the \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d scene at college or Shireen (Konkona Sen Sharma) who hides her job as a saleswoman from her overbearing, abusive, cheating husband, and finally Leela (Aahana Kumra), who has a boyfriend and dreams that do not include the planned arranged marriage, all these efforts to find themselves happen under the metaphorical burkha._line_A still from Lipstick Under My Burkha. Credit: YouTube_line_The women may be strong and funny when they are in their secret lives but they make almost no push for empowerment in their oppressive lives. Controlled and bound as they are by society and men, they appear to have no courage: they do not speak one word to challenge the shackles of patriarchy. In that, the film is in fact a beacon of hopelessness to women in India. If in the second decade of the 21st century, not one of these four women who live in the same building in Bhopal, cannot ever voice their anger or rage or frustration to their own families and friends openly, then one feels only despair for women in this country._line_Worse, the only way they can do what they want is by lying. Together with the tired old cliches of smoking, drinking and sex being markers of freedom, the film perpetuates the patriarchal stereotype that women are lying and conniving. One cannot and must not argue with the filmmaker\xe2\x80\x99s creative vision \xe2\x80\x93 that is her or his inalienable right. But it is possible to question the conclusions that this film is any sort of feminist masterpiece._line_That patriarchy still exists in India is undeniable. That small town India can be a few decades behind big city India is also perhaps understandable. But the efforts made by the four women to escape their almost pre-ordained captivity and boredom, are only a series of familiar stereotypes. It is true that younger women are smoking more nowadays. But have we really come \xe2\x80\x9ca long way baby\xe2\x80\x9d as the ad for Virginia Slims once said? And where have we come? For intelligent women to go back to that is really sad and even worse, for them to be so unaware of the consequences. The burkha \xe2\x80\x93 and perhaps this is inadvertent \xe2\x80\x93 which is used as a symbol of oppression and secrecy also becomes a means to lie and steal. When Shireen, a successful saleswoman on the verge of a promotion, realises her abusive husband is cheating on her, she tracks down the \xe2\x80\x9cother woman\xe2\x80\x9d but says nothing to her husband. In her feminism, she gives in to patriarchy. The saving grace as far as feminism is Usha Buaji who owns the building and runs a successful business but even she is publicly humiliated by the young man she has a crush on._line_Even worse from a human point of view is that the other men and women around them are all bound by the shackles of prejudice. These four women cannot find even one ally. And yet, there are glimpses of freer people around them; just glimpses. Perhaps those are the feminist icons, although some also fall victim to the smoking-drinking-sex-pregnancy-abortion route to women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment._line_Even in oppressive societies, strong women and men do emerge. If they had not, women would not have reached where they have today. Lipstick under my Burkha, sadly for me as an ageing feminist, took me back a few decades because it did not even hint that such women exist. Instead, the women behaved the way men for millennia have been telling us women behave, without courage and honour. To me that is patronising patriarchy at its worst._line_'
