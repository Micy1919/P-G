S'The new bill would gradually roll back the program, a move that some Republicans warn could lead to millions losing coverage.\n WASHINGTON: Two more US Republican senators announced their opposition Monday to their party\'s efforts to revamp Obamacare, derailing the controversial legislation in its current form and potentially dealing a monumental setback to President Donald Trump. \n Republican leaders are desperate for a major legislative victory this year -- and keen to fulfill Trump\'s campaign pledge to dismantle the 2010 health care reforms of his predecessor Barack Obama, formally called the Affordable Care Act. \n But they had no votes to spare. \n Republicans control 52 of the chamber\'s 100 seats. Democrats are united against the controversial legislation, while Republicans Susan Collins and Rand Paul declared their opposition last week. \n So when Senate conservatives Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announced late Monday they could not support the bill, the news sent shockwaves across Washington. \n "We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy," Moran -- who faced considerable opposition at home in Kansas to the measure -- said in a statement, adding that the new bill "fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address health care\'s rising costs." \n For Lee, "in addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn\'t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations." \n Their defections mean that the bill has no chance of even getting a vote on the Senate floor unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to make significant changes to woo skeptics back into the fold. \n "Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!" Trump tweeted after Lee and Moran made their opposition known. \n Over the weekend, McConnell delayed a vote to proceed on the bill, after Senator John McCain, 80, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot above his eye and said he would recuperate at home in Arizona for at least a week. \n But McCain\'s absence is now something of a moot point. \n Several Republicans had already expressed concern that the new bill could slash funding for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled. \n The new bill would gradually roll back the program, a move that some Republicans warn could lead to millions losing coverage. \n The latest defections also show that conservatives are frustrated that the new bill does not repeal the Obamacare taxes. \n As Republicans grappled with the collapse -- the second major stumble on the legislation in a mont -- Democratic reaction was swift. \n "This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable," said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer. \n "Rather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our health care system." \n Republican leaders are eager to notch a major victory for Trump in Congress as he nears the six-month mark of his presidency later this week, but health care is now unlikely to be that achievement. \n And while tax reform and infrastructure are also high priorities that Congress could address, they will need to take a back seat for now to a logjam of must-finish business in the Senate, including consideration of raising the limit on federal borrowing. \n Some fear that repealing Obamacare could adversely impact millions of Americans on Medicaid, or make health costs soar for people with pre-existing conditions. \n There is little institutional support for the bill, and even less for an amendment introduced by Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to offer bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare\'s coverage requirements. \n The chief executives of America\'s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association called it "simply unworkable in any form." \n A Post poll released Sunday showed Americans preferred Obamacare to the Republican plan by 50 percent to 24 percent. \n Despite the Republican setback, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said his rivals will take another bite at the health care apple. \n "There\'s a couple wheels off the bus right now," Murphy told MSNBC after the announcement from Lee and Moran. \n  But "they are not going to give up on it," he added. \n'

S'When was the last time you checked your smartphone? If you\'re like most people, it\'s probably sitting next to you right now. Or it may even already be in your hand.\nMobile use has exploded in the last few years, with more people than ever relying on their smartphones for everything from Googling random facts to researching the best products to buy.\n"Billions of times per day, consumers turn to Google for I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do, I-want-to-buy moments," Jerry Dischler, VP of product management at AdWords, told me. "And, at these times, consumers are increasingly picking up their smartphones for answers."\nGoogle has a name for these moments: micro-moments. These are split seconds of time where consumers use their devices to act on a need. And this small window of opportunity offers huge potential for your brand.\nBecause 70 percent of mobile searches lead to timely action, your brand needs to be ready to ensure that the action your consumers take involves your brand. Making sure your content is easily found, accessible and relevant will help your brand capitalize on these micro-moments and make them work for you. Here are four steps to do just that:\n1. Understand your consumer.\nBefore you can begin creating content, you need to first know what your consumers want. Who are they? What do they look like? Research their habits, preferences and demographics to get a sense of the type of person you are trying to attract to your brand.\nThen, consider what types of questions they would ask before purchasing your product or service. Creating content that answers these questions will make it more likely that consumers will turn to your brand in those micro-moments.\n2. Anticipate micro-moments.\nResearch shows that companies that take steps toward becoming "moments-ready" realize higher ROI in both mobile and overall marketing investment. To be moments-ready, yourself, understand when, where and why micro-moments occur for your consumer and how your brand fits in.\nThis goes back to those questions consumers ask before a purchase. For example, someone might do a Google search for the best pizza in New York City. Pizza restaurants located in the Big Apple, therefore, need to be ready for that micro-moment and do everything they can to ensure the consumer chooses their brand.\n"It is in these moments that preferences are shaped and decisions are made," Richard Flanagan, head of business marketing for Google Australia and New Zealand, told me.\nThere are tons of potential moments that could matter to your brand. It\'s impossible to capitalize on all of them, so how do you choose? It goes back to your consumers and what they want. Don\'t think just about the moment before they buy. Your brand should be there across the entire customer journey, so that at each stage, your relationship with the consumer grows stronger.\n3. Be relevant.\nSo, how do you make sure your brand shows up in a consumer\'s micro-moment? There are a number of factors involved, including following search-engine optimization best practices, but the main factor is the content you create.\nNot only do you need to answer the right questions with your content, you need to ensure the content is easily digestible. It should be easy for your consumers to find the answers they\'re looking for. You also need to make sure your content is educational and not too promotional.\nWith so little time to get your content across, if you can\'t provide what your audience members want, they\'ll turn to the next brand that can. In fact, 51 percent of smartphone users have purchased from a company or brand other than the one they intended to because the information those competitors provided was useful.\nYou also need to focus on the distribution of your content. It\'s not enough to create a brilliant piece of content if no one can find it. Make sure you\'re sharing content on the channels where your audience is.\n4. Focus on the experience.\n"With more computing power in our pockets than most of us had on our desks just a few years ago, our expectations have been massively raised. We expect everything right, and we expect it right away," said Lisa Gevelber, vice president of marketing at Google.\nLeveraging micro-moments isn\'t just about creating the right kind of content. It\'s also about ensuring that your consumer\'s experience with a piece of content is as easy and smooth as possible.\nYou need to focus on creating a positive mobile experience with your brand. That means streamlining the process of downloading the piece of content and eliminating as many steps as possible. If consumers have to fill out an outrageously long form to get the information they need, they will quickly lose interest -- and go somewhere else.\nNext Article\nThe 5 Traits (Some Surprising) I Look for When Hiring New Workers\nSujan Patel\n'

S'Holness ... there is the bigger issue of illegal flows through legal channels such as our ports.\n Prime Minister Andrew Holness has told Jamaicans living in the United Kingdom that his government is taking strategic steps to secure Jamaica\'s borders.\n According to the Prime Minister, Jamaica is affected by the global issues of safety and security, one of which is the importation of small arms.\n "We have taken some steps internally to secure our borders by the acquisition of certain assets that will help us to stem the illegal flows through illegal channels, but there is the bigger issue of illegal flows through legal channels such as our ports," Holness said.\n He was addressing members of the foreign services in Europe at the Jamaican High Commission in London.\n Holness also said the Government is treating national security as a major concern.\n "In the same way we have recalibrated our foreign policy to support economic growth and development, we will do the same recalibration of our foreign policy to support safety and security of Jamaica," he said.\n He emphasised the need to protect citizens especially in high crime zones and in areas where public safety is threatened stressing that the government will reassert itself in those areas while upholding human rights and the rule of law. \n'

S'FREMONT, Calif. - Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Friday the Model 3 had over half a million advance reservations as he handed over the first 30 to employee buyers, setting the stage for the biggest test yet of the company\'s strategy to become a profitable, mass market electric car maker.\nOutside Tesla\'s Fremont, California factory, Musk showed off the $35,000 base vehicle with a range of 220 miles (350 km) on a charge that marks a departure from the company\'s earlier luxury electric cars.\nHours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be "quite a challenge" to build the car during the early days of production.\n"We\'re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell," Musk told journalists.\nThe over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits. Any new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said.\nA longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a 15-inch touchstream display to the right of the driver.\nTesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production.\nWere Tesla to produce, and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States.\nProduction delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla\'s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year. Musk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems.\nTesla has burned through over $2 billion in cash so far this year ahead of the launch. A troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations.\nTesla\'s share price has surged 54 percent since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla\'s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\nUntil now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman CEO who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account. Now loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the United States.\nThe Model 3 is part of Musk\'s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Joe White and Lisa Shumaker)\n'

S'With just six days in hand, documents needed to file Income Tax Return (ITR) must be ready by now. If you are still waiting for the last day, then better not to. \nWhile you are reading about ITR forms, do not get confused between Form 16 and Form 16A. \nWhat is Form 16A?\nForm 16A is a tax deducted at source Certificate. While Form 16 is for only salary income, Form 16A is applicable for TDS on Income Other than Salary. \nThe Form 16A is certifies the amount of TDS, Nature of Payments and the TDS Payments deposited with the Income Tax Department. Form 16-As are issued when payments are non-Salary. TDS Professional fees, Rent, Bank Interest payments are accompanied by a Form 16A.\nMost of the times, Form 16A is issued to taxpayer by a bank. \nThis can be explained with an example. For instance, a Form 16A shall be issued to you when a bank deducts TDS on your interest income from fixed deposits, for TDS deducted on insurance commission, for TDS deducted on your rent receipts, in fact, when TDS is deducted on any other income you receive that is liable for such deduction, ClearTax explained. \nThis certificate also has details of the name and address of deductor/deductee, PAN/TAN details, challan details of TDS deposited. It also has details of income you have earned and the TDS deducted and deposited on such income.\nAll details that are there in Form 16A are available on Form 26AS. This can be used to file your return.\nHow form 16A is different from form 16?\nWhile From 16 is for anyone who earns a steady and regular income in the form of salary, Form 16A is for anyone who is either self-employed or a professional with document qualification degree.\nForm 16 is applicable on Interest on securities, dividends, interest other than interest on securities, etc. While Form 16 A is issued against rent, commission, professional charges, building, plant, machine hired, commission agents, etc.\n'

S'Using Natural Ingredients For Skin Detoxification From Everyday Dirt & Dust'

S"Other than everyday cleansing, toning and moisturizing, the skin also needs detoxification. Detoxification is an additional beauty approach on the skin such that all its dirt and dust content is extracted and washed off.\nEvery day when we wash or clean our face and body, the topical layer of dirt and dust gets cleared. With skin detoxification, a deep cleaning is done that clears off the existing layers of pollutants on the skin cells and tissues.\nWe have listed a few recommended natural ingredients that you can use to do skin detoxification right at home.\n Use these natural ingredients to detoxify your skin every alternate week and in a month's time, you will see a big difference in the skin texture and complexion. Take a look.\nJojoba Oil\nTo detoxify your skin with jojoba oil, first, moisturize your skin with a spoon of jojoba oil. Wait for five minutes till the oil sets in your skin cells and pores. Use a neat cotton pad to wipe off the jojoba oil from your skin.\nCurd\nThe second ingredient in the list is curd which is very simple to get. You can use curd for skin detoxification on an everyday basis. Always use hung curd, and massage it all over your face and skin for at least 15 minutes and then wash off. Do not compromise on the amount of curd, as less of it will make it tough to massage all over.\nTomato and Sugar\nThe tomato and sugar work like a scrub for the skin that clears all clogged skin pores and cells. Cut half a tomato, take one slice and a bowl of granular sugar. Dab the sugar on the tomato and scrub your skin with this. On one hand, the tomato juice will moisturize and soften your skin and on the other, the sugar will exfoliate.\nSugar and Lemon\nAmong the natural detoxifiers of the skin, another scrub recipe is sugar and lemon. Squeeze lemon juice first in a bowl. Add granular sugar to it such that both are consistently mixed. Now using your hands, scrub it especially on the blackheads and whiteheads. Please note, do not scrub on the skin with pimples, acne or rash.\nYeast and Lemon\nThis is a skin detoxifying pack in which you have to combine two ingredients - yeast and lemon. In a tablespoon of yeast, mix three to five tablespoons of lemon juice. Apply and wait for it to dry and then wash off using lukewarm water. You will instantly see the detoxification result on your skin.\nBasil Toner\nIn the skin detoxification process, you can also use a toner. The good part about toner is, after preparing, these can be preserved in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Coming to basil toner, the preparation is very simple, you have to blend fresh basil leaves in the blender and then, use a strainer to collect the fresh toner. For complete skin detoxification, soak a cotton pad in the basil toner and then, massage it all over your skin and face.\nCucumber Toner\nFor this one blend cucumber pieces, strain and collect the toner. This can also be preserved in the refrigerator. The best part about cucumber toner is, it has versatile uses, that is, the same can be applied on the under-eye area to remove dark skin as well. Spraying cucumber toner every day before makeup also acts as a light primer. So, once you make the cucumber toner, there is no way you can waste it.\nAlmond, Sugar, Cream And Olive Oil\nIn this skin detoxifier, you will require two kinds of sugar - white and brown in the same ratio. To the sugar mix, add crushed almond and mix the three ingredients. Lastly, make it into a paste by adding some olive oil to it. This cannot be preserved for future use and should be used as fresh as possible. Also, after massaging this on the skin, allow it dry for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n"

S'Delhi panel contradicts NGT, says AoL event wasn\'t held on Yamuna wetlands\n The Tribunal had also said that the action plan should refer to the recommendations of an expert committee it had appointed to assess the damage at the Yamuna floodplains. \nThere was no evidence of compaction of soil neither were any wetlands seen prior to and after the Art of Living Foundation\'s event in March 2016 on the Yamuna floodplains, a Delhi Development Authority (DDA)-led three-member panel submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday. Last week, the NGT\'s principal bench had directed the DDA to form a three-member committee and submit an action plan to restore the Yamuna floodplains. The Tribunal had also said that the action plan should refer to the recommendations of an expert committee it had appointed to assess the damage at the Yamuna floodplains.\nThe three-member panel\'s observations though, were directly in contradiction to the observations of the expert committee. "The land where the function of AoL was held is fully covered with grass along with some saplings and seedlings of various tree species here and there. This kind of grass and natural regeneration of seedlings is not possible on compacted soil. No significant size of wetland or water body was noticed by the committee in the area used by AoL," the panel report said. It added that from Google Earth images, it was evident that no wetland or water body was seen prior to the event.\nThe report of the three-member panel was prepared by Principal Commissioner, Horticulture, DDA, Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, Delhi government, and Chief Engineer, Yamuna Irrigation Department, Uttar Pradesh.\nThe NGT-appointed expert committee, though, had said in its report that wetlands were filled up during preparations for the event. "About 75 hectares were impacted due to levelling and consolidation and compacting...wetlands have to be de-silted and the compacted area has to be de-compacted," the expert committee had said in April. They had said that Rs 42 crore was required for physical and biological rehabilitation of the floodplains.\n'

S'As a parent, raising successful -- and happy -- kids is your primary job. Here\'s how the process starts.\nAsk parents what they want for their kids, and almost all will say they want their children to be happy. But ask what traits they want their children to possess -- ask what traits they hope to instill in their kids -- and far and away the number one quality is "to be responsible." What comes next on the list? The ability to work hard.\nOddly enough, responsibility and hard work provide the perfect recipe for happiness: When you achieve your goals, when you feel fulfilled, when your life has meaning -- that\'s a wonderful definition of happiness.\nWe all want our kids to be successful, in whatever pursuit they choose.\nBut while the destination may be different, the actual path to success is very similar. Success starts with mindset: the right perspective, the right outlook, the right motivation, and a real sense of purpose.\nThat\'s why it is so important to help your kids remember what they need to do, every day, to stay on the path to reaching their individual dreams.\nWant to help your kids be successful? Work to impart the following lessons. Not only will you help them today, but they will carry them through the rest of their lives, no matter where their hopes and dreams may take them.\n1. Teach them that the unknown is never as scary as it seems.\nThe most paralyzing fear is fear of the unknown. (At least it is for me.)\nYet few things turn out to be as hard or scary as we think. Plus, it\'s incredibly exciting to overcome a fear. You get that "I can\'t believe I just did that!" rush, a thrill you may not have experienced for a long time.\nEvery day, do something a little scary, whether physically or emotionally. Then, trust that you will figure out how to overcome any problems that arise.\nBecause you will.\nAnd if you don\'t, we\'ll help you.\n2. Teach them to do what other people are not willing to do.\nOften the easiest way to be different is to do the things other people don\'t want to.\nPick one thing other people won\'t do. It can be simple or small. Whatever it is, do it. You\'ll instantly be a little different from the rest of the pack.\nThen keep going. Every day think of one thing to do that no one else is willing to do.\nAfter a week you\'ll be uncommon. After a month you\'ll be special. After a year you\'ll be incredible, and you definitely won\'t be like anyone else.\n3. Teach them to look below the surface to be a good friend.\nSometimes your friends are hesitant. Sometimes they\'re insecure. Sometimes they\'re shy. Whatever the reason, sometimes they\'ll ask a different question than the one they really want you to answer.\nOne friend might ask whether you think he is a good basketball player. What he really wants to know is whether you think he should try out for the team; he hopes you\'ll say he should, and he hopes you\'ll share the reasons why.\nAnother friend might ask if she should take AP Physics. What she really wants to know is if you think she\'s smart enough to go to a great college, or even work in science. She hopes you do, and she\'ll love when you share the reasons why.\nBehind many questions is an unasked question.\nPay attention so you can answer that question too, because that is the answer the other person doesn\'t just want, but needs.\nThat\'s a great way to be a great friend.\n4. Teach them that achieving a huge goal always starts with one small step.\nYou have ideas. You have plans. You have goals. That\'s great. But you don\'t actually have anything until you do something.\nPeople let hesitation and uncertainty stop them from acting on their dreams. Pick one plan, one goal, or one idea. And get started. Just take one small step.\nThe first step is by far the hardest. Every successive step will be a lot easier.\n5. Teach them to live the life they want to live.\nMost of the time, it\'s healthy to worry about what other people think, but not if it stands in the way of living the life you really want to live.\nIf you really want to do something but you\'re worried that other people might say you\'re crazy, do it anyway. Pick one thing you haven\'t tried because you\'ve been concerned about what other people think or say, and just go do it.\nYour true friends will be proud of you.\nBetter yet, you will be proud of you. That\'s the best pride of all.\n6. Teach them how fun it is to be the underdog.\nI\'m ashamed to admit it, but one of the best ways to motivate me is to insult me -- or for me to manufacture a way to feel insulted, regardless of whether I\'m actually justified in feeling that way or not.\n"Justified" is not the point. Finding motivation to prove that person wrong, and, more important, to achieve what I want to achieve, is all that matters.\nCall it artificial competition or manufactured anger; call it childish and immature; call it creating perceived insults -- whatever you call it, it works for me. (Hey, it was good enough for Michael Jordan.)\nAnd it can work for you. So embrace being an underdog. That will help you try harder.\n7. Teach them that "good" is the best way to get to "great."\nI know. You hear all the time how you only get one chance to make a first impression. You hear all the time how perfection is the only acceptable outcome.\nUnfortunately, nothing is ever perfect. No one is ever perfect. The people who come close are the people who work hard, do the best they can, and let it go. The people who care about you will tell you how you can improve, and that means you\'ll get to make improvements that actually matter to people, and eventually overcome any shortcomings.\n8. Teach them to own their failures.\nAsk your friends why they got an A in a class. Their answers will be filled with personal pronouns: "I" and "me."\nAsk your friends why they failed a class. Their answers will be filled with stories about other people: their teachers, the material, the schedule. They\'ll say it was because of someone or something else. It\'s always someone else\nAnd that\'s a problem, because when you distance yourself, you can\'t learn from your failures.\nOccasionally something completely outside your control will cause you to fail. Most of the time, though, it\'s you. And that\'s OK. In fact, that\'s great. Every successful person has failed numerous times. Most of them have failed a lot more often than you can imagine That\'s why they\'re successful now.\nEmbrace every failure: Own it, learn from it, and take full responsibility for making sure that next time, you\'ll make sure things turn out differently.\n9. Teach them to help other people feel good about themselves.\nAll around you are people who work hard with little or no recognition. Be the person who recognizes at least one of them, every day.\nNot only will you give respect, you\'ll earn it -- the respect that comes from making a difference, however fleeting, in another person\'s life, which is the best kind of respect there is.\n10. Teach them to trust the power of hard work.\nLike Jimmy Spithill, skipper of America\'s Cup-winning Team Oracle USA, says, "Rarely have I seen a situation where doing less than the other guy is a good strategy."\nCompared to other people you may not be as smart, as athletic, as outgoing, or as confident.... but you can always outthink, outhustle, and outwork everyone else.\nEven when everything seems stacked against you, effort and persistence are on your side -- and often they are the only things you truly need.\nYou don\'t always have to be first. Sometimes all you have to do is be the last person still trying.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

Depending on which area of the body you are looking at to treat the blackheads, you have to pick a relevant remedy.\nToday, we will be discussing about the problem of chin blackheads.

When completely dried, blend it in the mixer to a powdered form. You can also get readymade orange peel from the market.\nMix orange peel powder with lime juice and scrub this on your chin, every alternate day, for 10 minutes.\nDo wash and moisturize at the end.\nTry applying orange peel or paste on the affected area and leave it on for at least 15 minutes.\nAloe Vera Gel\n1 aloe vera leaf\nCut the aloe vera leaf, scoop out the gel.\n Coat your chin with the natural aloe vera gel such that it is like a mask.\n Wait for 15 minutes and then wash with lukewarm water.\n Moisturize at the end.\n You can repeat this aloe vera gel treatment on blackheads for up to three times a week.\nMilk And Honey Strips\n1 tablespoon of milk\n 1 tablespoon of organic honey\n Cotton pads\nMix the milk and honey in raw form. Microwave this for 30 seconds and then allow it to cool.\nTake cotton pads, dip in the milk and honey mix and apply it on the blackhead area of your chin.\nLet the cotton pad dry on your chin area and then remove it.\nThis is a time-taking method but the result is quick.\nCinnamon And Honey Strips\n2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder\n 1 tablespoon of raw honey\n Cotton pads\nMix the cinnamon powder and honey.\n Dip the cotton pads in the mixture, and coat your blackhead area with this mix and then, wash off with cold water.\n Leave it on for 15 minutes and then rinse.\nJojoba Oil And Granular Sugar\n2 teaspoons of granular sugar\n 2 tablespoons of jojoba oil\nMix the oil and sugar to make a scrub.

S'\xe2\x80\x8bMore and more guys are getting diagnosed with it, too\nHigh blood sugar can make it hard to get hard: Men with diabetes are significantly more likely to have erectile dysfunction that those with normal blood sugar readings, new research in the journal Diabetic Medicine concludes. That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, since diabetes cases have increased four-fold since 1980.\nAfter crunching the numbers from 145 studies including over 88,000 men who averaged 56 years old, the researchers determined that those with diabetes were more than three times as likely to have erectile dysfunction than healthy guys were. In fact, 59 percent of men with diabetes had ED.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, men with diabetes tended to develop their erectile dysfunction 10 to 15 years earlier than those without the condition did, according to the study. (Want to keep your penis healthy for life? The Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Guide to Erectile Dysfunction is the only resource you need.)\nSo how can high blood sugar sink you in the bedroom?\nDiabetes can damage your blood vessels and your nerves\xe2\x80\x94both of which are needed for healthy erectile functioning, says Sean Skeldon, M.D., who has previously researched ED and diabetes, but was not involved in this study. (Here are 10 myths about erectile dysfunction you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe anymore.)\nAnother important point: Erectile dysfunction is often considered a harbinger of heart disease. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the blood vessel issues that cause ED\xe2\x80\x94say, like plaque buildup\xe2\x80\x94can also affect your heart, too. They just manifest first with problems in the bedroom, since your blood vessels in your penis are smaller than the ones that carry blood to your heart. (Here are 8 other weird facts you never knew about your heart.)\nThe good news, though, is that many of the risk factors for diabetes are under your control\xe2\x80\x94meaning your penis and your heart could benefit from some prevention strategies. One easy one? Eat three servings of legumes a week. That can cut your risk of diabetes by 35 percent, as we recently reported, possibly because their fiber can help prevent blood sugar spikes.\n'

S"International hospitality firms have recently been quietly stepping up their efforts in Central Asia, with a push in Kazakhstan in particular. Hyatt Hotels opened a new Hyatt Regency Hotel in Almaty, Kazakhstan this year. Hilton has also signaled that it will be opening two hotels in Kazakhstan, in Almaty and Astana. The most prominent new hotel to open in Kazakhstan is the new, ultra-luxury Ritz-Carlton Astana.\nThis is not to say that luxury hospitality offerings in Central Asia are an entirely new phenomenon. Many of the region\xe2\x80\x99s large cities have had such options available for some time, Uzbekistan, in particular, stands out in this regard. Tashkent and Samarkand have many luxury hotel offerings and Hyatt recently opened a new state-of-the-art location in Tashkent.\n The DailyBrief \nMust-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox\nHowever, this expansion in Kazakhstan illustrates that international firms are anticipating a potential boom in Chinese high net worth individual travel to the region with the ramping up of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s Belt & Road Initiative (BRI).\nBRI is an economic integration project designed to improve infrastructure and lower barriers to Eurasian trade. More wealthy Chinese travelers will undoubtedly be coming to Central Asia and other regions included in the initiative.\nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan are taking the lead in the region in reaching out to Beijing to boost economic ties and travel, but they are certainly not alone\nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan are taking the lead in the region in reaching out to Beijing to boost economic ties and travel, but they are certainly not alone. Overall, it signals a major shift in the overall global tourism industry that is directly related to China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political rise and is spurring previously ignored destinations to improve their travel options and infrastructure to accommodate wealthy Chinese travelers.\nHowever, much of the new potential travel to Central Asia resulting from BRI will be spurred by business travel and not necessarily by leisure tourism. This is likely what is influencing new international interest on the part of hospitality firms in the region.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that Chinese tourism to Central Asia won\xe2\x80\x99t pick up or that governments in the region aren\xe2\x80\x99t banking on it.\nDr Parag Khanna of the National University of Singapore remarked in an interview with Jing Daily this past summer, \xe2\x80\x9cKazakhstan and Uzbekistan have and are building very good infrastructure, have plenty of hotels. They could easily manage\xe2\x80\xa6 way more than 20 to 30 times the number [of] tourists they now get.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUzbekistan reached an agreement with China to boost bilateral tourism cooperation this year. This agreement focused on easing visa restrictions and ensuring ease of access for tour groups. Uzbekistan\xe2\x80\x99s tourism authorities hope to boost ecotourism and mountain tourism in particular, but also want to expand tourism offerings in general. Aside from visas, ease of bank card use and increasing the number of Chinese-speaking tourism workers is also key to these efforts.\nKazakhstan has been stepping up tourism cooperation efforts as well. In April, 2017 was declared the official year of Chinese tourism in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Additionally, Air Astana organized a Beijing event with over 80 travel agency and press representatives. The airline hopes to address deficiencies in local Kazakh tourism infrastructure by stepping up Beijing-Kazakhstan flights and providing Chinese-language tour guides and general assistance to visitors.\nWill these efforts help put Central Asia on the map for Chinese tourists? Only time will tell, but it is clear that everyone involved expects an increase of Chinese travel of some kind.\nThis article was originally published on Jing Travel. \n Mason is a China expert who has done research on modern Chinese business history and consumer culture.

S'One of the core concepts in the digital marketing industry is the sales funnel. While odd sounding at first, this single core concept can take a business from virtually non-existent and unknown to multi-million-dollar marketing machine with mass saturation, seemingly overnight. In fact, there are skilled practitioners who have built a career around implementing this single concept in business. \nIf you\'re wondering what a sales funnel is, simply imagine a real-world funnel. At the top of that funnel, some substance is poured in, which filters down towards one finite destination. In sales, something similar occurs. At the top, lots of visitors arrive who may enter your funnel. However, unlike the real-world funnel, not all who enter the sales funnel will reemerge out from the other end. \nIn marketing automation, Ryan Deiss, co-founder of Digital Marketer, often describes the sales funnel as a multi-step, multi-modality process that moves prospective browsers into buyers. It\'s multi-stepped because lots must occur between the time that a prospect is aware enough to enter your funnel, to the time when they take action and successfully complete a purchase. \nThere are email warming sequences that include things like personalized value-driven stories, tutorials and even soft pushes to webinars, and of course product suggestions that happen over days or even weeks. The truth is that most prospects won\'t buy from your website at first glance, especially if they\'re only just becoming aware of you today. It takes time. Thus, the funnel is a multi-modality process, as there are a variety of relationship-building experiences and "touches" that occur through several stages. \nMuch of this is steeped in buyer psychology. The best marketers in the world know that there is a psychological process that must occur for prospects to whip out those credit cards and turn into buyers or even hyper-active buyers. One such person whose perfected this process is Russell Brunson, an "underground entrepreneur" who founded a company called ClickFunnels, a sales funnel SaaS business that empowers marketers from around the world to build marketing automation without all the hassle. \nAs a software engineer myself, I can tell you that building funnels from an application standpoint takes massive amounts of work. There\'s a great deal of coding and integration that\'s required here. From email systems to landing page implementations to credit card processing APIs, and everything in between, so many platforms need to "talk," that it takes the bar too high for the average marketer. \nHowever, what Brunson cleverly conceived with ClickFunnels is to create a SaaS that can integrate with the world\'s most popular platforms and virtually anyone can quietly launch a funnel in hours as opposed to weeks of hefty coding and programming. As a fervent user of ClickFunnels myself, I can tell you that the system is impressive beyond measure.\nUnderstanding Sales Funnels\nTo better understand the concept of a sales funnel and just how you can implement it in your own business, let\'s look at the following image from Shutterstock. On the left side of the image, you see a magnet. That magnet is attracting customers, which happens a number of ways. From blogging to social media to paid ads and everything in between, how the visitors arrive to your website has some impact on the success of your funnel. \nStage 1: Awareness\nWhat\'s more important about the sales funnel is what happens when those visitors (we can call them prospects) actually do arrive. Through a variety of means, many of which you\'ve already seen, such as email newsletter signups, ebook downloads, online quizzes and more, those prospects enter into your sales funnel through an enticing offer. \nThe goal of your entire sale funnel and platform is to solve your customer\'s problem. When you know the problem, and you build content to draw them in, then offer them a product or service to solve their problem, that\'s when the real magic happens. However, getting to that stage takes work and you have to garner their awareness first. \nOnce the prospect is in the proverbial funnel, you\'ve peaked their awareness. That\'s the first stage of the funnel. However, getting a prospect aware of you is no simple feat. Depending upon how they\'ve arrived to your website (organically or through a paid ad), those customers might view your funnel differently and your opt-in rates will vary significantly. \nFor example, when a customer finds you organically through a Google search for example, that means you have some element of authority. When you have authority, prospects are more likely to enter into your funnel because they know that if they found you relevantly, that whatever it is that you\'re providing must be of a great value. That\'s just the nature of SEO and organic search. \nOf course, regardless of how they enter into your funnel, your goal as a marketer is to move them through the multiple stages that will take them from prospect to buyer. And once they\'re aware of you, you need to build their interest. To do this, you need to establish a relationship with the customer. You might have enticed them with a great offer (lead magnet) to grab their email address, but actually moving them through the funnel is a far greater challenge. \nThe truth? People are smart. They\'re not simply going to buy anything from anyone unless they feel there\'s an immense amount of value to be had there. Thus, your funnel needs to built that value and bake it in through a variety of means. But most importantly, you have to create a strong bond with your prospect, and that happens by being relatable, honest and transparent in your email warming sequence.\nStage 2: Interest\nYou gain the prospects interest through an email sequence. You begin to relate stories to them that tie into who you are and how you\'ve arrived to this point in your life. Brunson, in his book, Expert Secrets, calls this the Attractive Character. Are you the reluctant hero whose journey happened almost by mistake, but you feel like you owe it to yourself and the world to convey something of great value?\nOr, are you a leader, an adventurer or an evangelist? How you position yourself is entirely up to you, but your message must be consistent throughout your entire "pitch" and it needs to be steeped in the truth. Your backstory, and just how you convey that through parables, character flaws and polarity, has much to do with just how well you can "hook" in your prospects to create a mass movement.\nOf course, implementing this isn\'t easy. You need to first develop your stories, then decide on how you\'re going to convey those stories and at what drip-rate. For example, your first email or two might go out on the day they first signup, then one email per day might go out afterwards. How much of that will be story-based and how much will be pitches?\nIn a recent conversation I had with Perry Belcher, co-founder of Native Commerce Media, he told me that you also need to train your prospects to click on links. For example, you could have them click on a link of what interests them or link them to a blog post or eventually to a product or service that you\'re selling, but you need to train them to build a habit of clicking on those links from the very beginning.\nStage 3: Decision\nThe next stage is the decision. Getting prospects to make a decision isn\'t easy. The best way to get them there? Beyond the art of story telling, copywriting and building the habit of link-clicking, you need to have lots and lots of customer reviews and testimonials. This is one of the most powerful ways that you can get people to take action.\nOf course, if you\'re going the paid ad route, you could also use Facebook and Google re-targeting to keep that awareness and interest level high. For example, if you\'ve ever noticed after leaving a particular website, that you begin to see their ad everywhere, there\'s a particular reason for that. Especially if they\'ve already entered your sales funnel, this is a very powerful way to get them to act.\nFor example, you could show them re-targeting ads that have video testimonials or reviews by other customers. If you have media publications that have written about you, you could take that opportunity to highlight those. When they see this in your sales funnel and you follow them around with re-targeting, it\'s simply an added element of exposure.\nBut however you get them to decide to act, flipping that switch isn\'t simple. You need to present them with a great opportunity and use Robert Cialdini\'s 6 principles, outlined in his 1984 book, Influence, in one way or another to move them through this stage: \nPrinciple of reciprocity -- This is achieved by delivering lots of value, either through whatever it is that you provided them as a free offer (lead magnet) in the very beginning, or in an ongoing exchange through your emails. \nPrinciple of commitment & consistency -- When people commit to something, they\'re far more likely to purchase from you. That\'s why getting them to agree to something like a free + shipping offer or by agreeing with something you\'ve said in some way. This is a powerful principle in sales and if you pay attention to some of the best marketers in the world, you\'ll notice that they work fervently to get your commitment to something, even if it\'s very small in the beginning. \nPrinciple of liking -- When people like you (i.e. they relate to your stories) they are more likely to purchase something from you. How well you craft your story and convey that to your prospects is going to play a big role in whether they decide to act or not. \nPrinciple of authority -- How much authority do your products or services have? Are their respected people in your community that have endorsed it? Scientific studies that are backing it? Are you yourself an authority? All these elements come into play in this process. \nPrinciple of social proof -- Do you have social proof? Are people on social media raving or talking about how great your products or services are? Do you have some other type of social proof? Best-selling books? Something else? It\'s importnat that you present this to prospects if you do have them. \nPrinciple of scarcity -- How much scarcity have you baked into your email sequence? Again, people are smart, but when you apply the principle of scarcity, as in there are only a limited amount of some offer or time left before a discount expires or slots available for an online class, it entices people to take action.\nStage 4: Action\nThe final stage of the sales funnel is the action that you\'re intending them to perform. In most cases this is the purchase. Again, how well you move them through the various stages is going to set you up with a specific conversion for this action. For example, if 100 people click on your offer and 10 people enter your sales funnel but only purchase people purchase, then you have a 2 percent conversion. \nHowever, the best part about this, and the most powerful route that entrepreneurs take to scale their businesses, is that if you know that sending 100 people to your site costs you $200, for example, but you get two people to convert at $300 each, then you have a $600 return on $200 invested (300 percent). When you know that, that\'s when the entire game changes and you can infinitely scale your offers.\nThis how the world\'s smartest marketers scale out their businesses. They know the conversion value and they\'ve tweaked and perfected their sales funnels, so they go after this with a vengeance by simply scaling out their offers. If you know that, by investing $1 you\'re going to get $3 back, you will infinitely invest $1 repeatedly. Get the point?\nHowever, getting to this stage is no simple feat. It takes an enormous amount of work and effort plus tracking. By implementing sales funnel software, such as the platform built by Brunson, you can definitely cut down the headache, but there\'s still lots of work to be done. Copy needs to be written, tracking pixels need to be installed and email sequences need to be created. But that\'s what it takes to succeed.\nThink about that the next time you\'re building out a sales funnel. This complex and intricate concept in business can literally take you from a complete unknown to a global powerhouse quickly through the art of scaling out a highly-converting offer. Don\'t try to take shortcuts or implement hacks, and put in the time if you\'re looking to eventually reap the benefits and results.\nNext Article\n10 Passionate Business Ideas for Your Next Startup\nR.L.

S"Stevie Nicol's Premier League top 4 predictions\nThe 2017-18 European season is nearly upon us and, with Serie A having finally released its fixture list this week, we have a clear idea of which games to watch and when. Here's a selection of the most intriguing fixture for each weekend in August, leading up until the month-ending international break and transfer window closure.\nAug. 6: Lille vs. Nantes\nOrdinarily, there would be nothing special about this run-of-the-mill Ligue 1 fixture. It's not a meeting between two major sides and it's not a local derby, but it does feature a fascinating managerial clash: Marcelo Bielsa vs. Claudio Ranieri, AKA the ideologue vs. the pragmatist.\nBielsa takes charge of a Lille side that finished an unimpressive 11th last season, but which have made some eye-catching signings. Highly-rated midfielder Thiago Maia is the most intriguing and, together with his compatriots Luiz Araujo, a left-winger, and holding midfielder Thiago Mendes, Lille have splashed close to \xc2\xa330m on three promising Brazilians. They're just three of nine buys with an average age of 22. Bielsa is doing his usual thing: Packing the squad with energetic, hungry players, who can be moulded to suit his philosophy.\nNantes, meanwhile, were flattered by their seventh-place finish last season; they were an unimaginative, defensive-minded side who scored fewer goals -- 40 -- than third-bottom Lorient. But perhaps Ranieri will be able to transform them into a counter-attacking unit in the manner of his famous Leicester team. Speedy wide forward Prejuce Nakoulma made an impact having arrived midway through last season, although striker Emiliano Sala is very much an old-school target man and will need appropriate service.\nThis should be an interesting tactical contest between two wise old managers. Neither are likely to mount a title challenge but, on opening day in Ligue 1, expect Bielsa's side to come flying out of the blocks and Ranieri to set his men up to pick off their hosts.\nAug. 12: Brighton vs. Manchester City\nIt will be Brighton's first top-flight game since 1983 and an emotional occasion for the home supporters, who have spent much of the past 30 years concerned by where their club will play, never might at what level they would compete. After leaving their old Goldstone Ground in 1997, Brighton shared 50 miles away at Gillingham, then moved to an athletics stadium in their home town before, after years of political wrangling, finally building a purpose-built stadium.\nAfter several near misses in their bid to be promoted from the Championship, they will savour Premier League football for the first time. Manager Chris Hughton boasts experience at the highest level and is a master of drilling his players in a simple, back-to-basics defensive system. Brighton won't roll over easily and, in French attacking midfielder Anthony Knockaert, have a potential star in their ranks.\nBut the major story is the new-look Manchester City. Strengthened with five signings, including an entirely new set of full-backs, Pep Guardiola essentially has no excuse for failure this season. Having tried various new tactical experiments during his first year in charge, it feels like City's manager will revert to a more conventional approach this time around, with overlapping full-backs and a more standard 4-2-3-1 system.\nThis feels like a gentle warm-up for City. However, visiting newly-promoted sides can be a tricky task; they're something of an unknown quality, the atmosphere will be excellent and Brighton's players will be determined to prove they belong. The hosts play good football but, on this occasion, a direct approach to exploit City's weaknesses makes sense.\nAug. 20: Tottenham vs. Chelsea\nLast season's top two in England on the second weekend of the new campaign. Their league games in 2016/17 were both excellent, with Chelsea earning a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in November, before Tottenham produced arguably the best team performance of the season to convincingly win 2-0 at White Hart Lane just over a month later.\nThen there was a quite extraordinary FA Cup semifinal, which Chelsea won 4-2 at Wembley, which will host this latest clash of London rivals. Tottenham have moved 12 miles west of White Hart Lane for a season at the national stadium and one of the keenest observers of the situation will be Chelsea, who are likely to follow suit with a temporary Wembley arrangement as they redevelop Stamford Bridge.\nThe game itself should be great. Mauricio Pochettino's approach against Antonio Conte last season was based around matching Chelsea's 3-4-3; Tottenham play the system with great cohesion and fluidity and the versatility of Eric Dier allows them to switch seamlessly between a three-man defence and a back four.\nConte's side, meanwhile, will have their first major test as defending champions. Alvaro Morata's performance will be of particular interest and he won't have a tougher challenge than facing the league's best defensive pairing of Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. It could be a steep learning curve for the Spanish striker.\nAug. 26: Roma vs. Inter\nThe first big game of the Italian season is given extra spice by the fact that Inter's new manager is Luciano Spalletti, who will return to the Stadio Olimpico just weeks after leaving Roma for the second time, having taken the Giallorossi to the highest second-place points tally -- 87 -- in Serie A history.\nHis job at Inter is far from simple. The club's recent record is mediocre -- fourth is their best league finish in the last six seasons -- and yet there is always expectation of a title challenge. Spalletti is the most forward-thinking, progressive coach Inter have had for years, however, and transfer business has been quietly encouraging. Borja Valero, signed from Fiorentina, has been one of Serie A's most creative midfielders in recent years, while young centre-back Milan Skriniar was excellent at Sampdoria last season.\nRoma's new boss is Eusebio Di Francesco and he's been forced to cope with several major departures: Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, defender Antonio Rudiger, winger Mohamed Salah and legendary playmaker Francesco Totti have all left. Even if Roma's No. 10 only played a bit-part role last season, it will still be curious to see them begin a campaign without Totti for the first time since 1992-93.\nIt would be a surprise if either of these sides won Serie A this season; defending champions Juventus, the increasingly impressive Napoli and a refreshed Milan seem more likely winners. However, with Serie A entitled to four automatic Champions League places, the battle for fourth is now meaningful and it might come down to Roma and Inter.\n"

S'England all-rounder Ben Stokes says he was left devastated by his last over horror show in the World Twenty20 final against West Indies and has yet to watch a re-run of Carlos Brathwaite hitting him for four straight sixes.\nThe 24-year-old, who had earned plaudits for his efforts in the last over of England\'s semi-final win over New Zealand, was tasked with bowling the final over on Sunday in Kolkata with the West Indies needing an unlikely 19 from it to win.\nBut Brathwaite slugged Stokes\' first four deliveries for giant sixes to give the West Indies their second World Twenty 20 title and leave the Englishman on his haunches looking close to tears.\n"I thought, \'I\'ve just lost the World Cup\'. I couldn\'t believe it," Stokes was quoted as saying by British newspaper The Daily Telegraph on Friday.\n"I didn\'t know what to do. It took me so long to get back on my feet. I didn\'t want to get back up. It was like the whole world had come down on me. There weren\'t any good things going through my mind. It was just complete devastation."\nStokes, who had given up just three runs in the final over against New Zealand, said he was still confident of closing out victory against the West Indies even after Brathwaite had clubbed his first two deliveries over the rope.\n"After the first six I thought, \'Oh God\', but I was backing myself. I had been in that type of situation for four weeks in all my training so it was not a case of holding anything back and thinking I hope I get this one in, because I knew I could do it," Stokes said.\n"I haven\'t watched it back yet because I don\'t want to bring myself to do that at this stage so I don\'t know how much I missed it by but as a bowler you have a feeling as soon as you let go whether or not you have got a yorker right and it felt like I had."\nStokes was subject to ridicule in his native New Zealand, and two radio presenters were suspended after they broadcast a conversation with his mother on air as she tried to defend her son against the criticism.\nStokes said despite the experience in the final he would not be shirking the responsibility of bowling at the death again.\n"Some days they go well. Some days they don\'t," he added.\n"That was a bad day but I won\'t be shying away from it. You almost want it to happen because if you nail it everyone forgets (the final)."\n'

S'Jaipur: Heavy rainfall and water released from the Jawai Dam have flooded parts of Jalore and neighbouring areas in Rajasthan, officials said on Saturday. More than 70,000 cusec of water were released from the dam - the largest in western Rajasthan - yesterday evening.\nPic Courtesy: Eenaduindia/Hindi\nHeavy downpour also affected normal life in the adjoining Pali and Sirohi districts, where many villages are on high alert and relief and rescue operations are carrying on.

"Many villages in Jalore are flooded, and some roads have been washed away. Relief work is underway," L N Soni, the Collector of Jalore, said.\n Soni said the district administrations in Pali and Jalore had alerted villagers before the gates were opened. "People in several hundred villages in Pali, Sirohi and Jalore had been affected by the flood-like situation," the district collector said.\n In many villages, people were being rescued from their rooftops by the Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), he added.

S'Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch review: iPad Pro 10.5-inch is a new size for the series. Apple might well phase out the smaller 9.7-inch version as this new size gains ground. The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch review: iPad Pro 10.5-inch is a new size for the series. Apple might well phase out the smaller 9.7-inch version as this new size gains ground. The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version.\nThe iPad has for long been lording over the tablet segment. But now, even as tablet sales across the world have plateaued, Apple wants the iPad to start replacing laptops of creative users. But can a really powerful tablet take on the likes of the MacBook Pro and offer a better option? Well, this is exactly what I set to figure out with the new iPad Pro 10.5-inch which has just hit the markets.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch specifications: 10.5-inch display with 2224 x 1668 resolution at 264 ppi | A10X Fusion 4th chip with 64-bit | 64GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12MP rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, Quad-LED True Tone flash, 4K video recording + 7MP front camera | iOS 11 | Four speaker audio | Wi\xe2\x80\x91Fi (802.11a/\xe2\x80\x8bb/\xe2\x80\x8bg/\xe2\x80\x8bn/\xe2\x80\x8bac); dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) MIMO | Bluetooth 4.2 | Nano-SIM\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch price in India: Rs 50,400 onwards\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch design and display review\nThe Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch is a new size for the series. Apple might well phase out the smaller 9.7-inch version as this new size gains ground. The new size offers more real estate, especially since it has a thinner bezel than the earlier version. In fact, the overall size is not that different, but the impact on screen size is significant. Still the 10.5-inch form factor is easy to manage and use. The rest of the design remains the same.\nThe one visible hardware change the new iPad Pro ushers in is with display quality. While this too is a Retina display like before, this has an unprecedented 120Hz refresh rate. That is something seen only on high-end televisions and never before on any sort of mobile screen. But what does this mean for the user?\nWell, to start with this is a much better, more natural experience, when it comes to watching high quality videos or playing games. The frames have no lag in between, however high the quality of the graphics in the game. On the productivity front this means the Apple Pencil works more naturally too. The millisecond lag in the earlier version is no longer there and the experience is more like pencil on paper, though I still think the Apple Pencil is more marble than wood for my liking.\nAs a side note, I need to add that the Apple iPad Pro is still the gold standard when it comes to audio quality on anything mobile. Pair the stunning screen and speakers together and you have arguably the best mobile video consumption device in the world at the moment.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch performance review \nThe iPad Pro might be a good video consumption device, but Apple seems to be pitching this more as a video creation device. The 64-bit A10X Fusion chip works in tandem with an M10 coprocessor to offer professional grade performance on a one-pound device. At the launch, the company wowed everyone by doing stuff on the iPad Pro that a MacBook Pro wont be able to do all that easily. For average users this means doing everyday tasks without any lag, or editing photos realtime with no wait for the corrected images to render. However, if you want to edit video, or create and add graphics to the same, this is the only tablet in the world that will be able to do it.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5 inch might be a good video consumption device, but Apple seems to be pitching this more as a video creation device.\nWhile my creativity is limited to text, I did check out with some more creative people on how the iPad Pro improved their productivity and even those using the version of the iPad Pro seemed to think this version was far better. With apps like Procreate you can now do Adobe Photoshop level layered editing on the iPad Pro and the results are visible almost instantaneous, no need to wait for a render. This nimbleness is there even when you edit video or add graphics to it.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch battery review \nThe new iPad Pro has a slightly bigger battery than the 9.5-inch version. But despite the extra bright screen and faster refresh rate, the iPad is able to offer close to a full working day of life on the trot. In fact, I charged the review unit for the first time after a week of random use. Also power efficiency is where the M10 coprocessor does most of its work.\nThe new Apple iPad Pro 10.5 inch has a slightly bigger battery than the 9.5-inch version. But despite the extra bright screen and faster refresh rate, the iPad is able to offer close to a full working day of life on the trot.\nIn fact the A10x processor is not even called to work for a lot of tasks like notification updates or email syncing and this helps save power. Plus, the display redress rate falls drastically if you are not watching video or playing a game. However, I think Apple should maybe offer a stamina mode where it can offer longer battery life for those who need it.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch accessories\nThe Apple iPad Pro comes with two accessories \xe2\x80\x94 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard \xe2\x80\x94 that add to its productivity. However, both of these have not got a refresh with the new iPad Pro, except for the new size of the Magic Keyboard. However, the experience of using the Apple Pencil has improved significantly thanks to the higher refresh rate of the screen. It now makes better sense to buy the Apple Pencil than a year before. I just hope Apple offers add-ons to the pencil that make it feel more natural. The keyboard is the same, and takes time getting used to. I prefer using a third-party one with more travel than Apple can offer.\nThe Apple iPad Pro comes with two accessories \xe2\x80\x94 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard \xe2\x80\x94 that add to its productivity.\nThe one accessory that is new is the Apple sleeve, which finally bring in a case to stash away the iPad and a slot to secure the Pencil. Earlier, managing the Pencil was a bit of a pain.\nApple iPad Pro 10.5-inch verdict\nIf you are looking for a tablet that will replace your laptop and still let you stick to high-end resource-heavy creativity, then your quest ends here. There is no other tablet that can do this much and this efficiently, that too without breaking a sweat. But if you just want a tablet to browse and consume video, then look at the more affordable iPads. As the name suggests, this is clearly for the Pros. And on the question, whether the new Apple iPad Pro can replace a laptop, I would now be inclined to say yes. I would be comfortable making this my online mobile device and not the backup.\n'

S' Chefs\xe2\x80\x99 Picks tracks down what the pros are eating and cooking from coast to coast.\nChefs may have a reputation for being choosy when it comes to dining out, but it seems the pickiest palates actually belong to their children. Luckily in a city like Chicago, there are plenty of places that cater to those tiniest of food critics. Read on to find out where the pros go to score kid-friendly snacks.\nThe Sweetest Stack\n One food that makes Executive Chef Bryan Allen\xe2\x80\x99s daughter flip is pancakes, particularly the ones at Siena Tavern. The restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s almond pancakes \xe2\x80\x94 served with lemon-cardamom cream and almond butter \xe2\x80\x94 are her current obsession (never mind that dad serves pancakes on his own brunch menu at The Windsor). \xe2\x80\x9cShe always asks for extra almond butter and she loves citrus\xe2\x80\xa6 the lemon cream is her favorite part,\xe2\x80\x9d Allen says. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no problems with helping her finish them \xe2\x80\x94 they are excellent!\xe2\x80\x9d\n Mac and Cheese with a Kick\n Chef Greg Biggers may spend his days crafting upscale dishes for Caf\xc3\xa9 de Architectes, but when he\xe2\x80\x99s with his son, fancy food is not top of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cMy seven year old has three basic food groups: macaroni and cheese, chicken legs and ice cream,\xe2\x80\x9d Biggers says. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter he found out that Honey Butter Fried Chicken had what he refers to as, \xe2\x80\x98Epic Mac-N-Cheese!!!!\xe2\x80\x99 that became our go-to spot in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d This menu mainstay is a pimento-laced version of mac and cheese, which has proven to be popular with both kids and adults. After the mac, Biggers and his son make a beeline for the Brookfield Zoo to score a sweet favorite. \xe2\x80\x9cLiving out in Brookfield near the Brookfield Zoo, we are also now required to stop by ZOO City Treats to round out his meal with Superman Ice Cream on the way home,\xe2\x80\x9d Biggers says.\n Hot Diggity Dog!\n Between his Logan Square hot spot Giant and his newly opened City Mouse, Jason Vincent is a busy man. He is also a family man (in fact, he named both restaurants after books that his daughters love). When Vincent has time to kick back with his girls, he takes them to a classic Chicago drive-in: Superdawg. \xe2\x80\x9cMy favorite thing to do with the girls is to go to Superdawg and get hot dogs, fries and some shakes and make a picnic in the way back of our station wagon\xe2\x80\xa6 we just sit there and talk and watch the other people,\xe2\x80\x9d Vincent says.\n Gotta Get That Gelato\n Baker Ellen King\xe2\x80\x99s impeccable pastries at Hewn in Evanston, Illinois, have satisfied many a sweet tooth\xe2\x80\xa6 but surprisingly not her son\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cOwning a bakery, you would think your kid would be in heaven eating cookies, croissants, etc.; however, my son does not really like to eat any of the sweets at the bakery,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Instead, he ventures down the street to an Argentinian gelato shop called Frio Gelato. \xe2\x80\x9cThe flavors constantly change and\xe2\x80\xa6 [my son] is willing to try any flavor and venture out of the box, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d The recent favorite of this 10-year-old gelato aficionado? Malbec con Frutos Rojos (Malbec with Berries).\nSurprise your favorite little eaters with a sweet treat of their own by putting together a gelato bar, like this one from Giada De Laurentiis.\n   Advertisement   \n'

S'Back in April, singer Michelle Branch came out with "Hopeless Romantic," her third full-length studio record. It\'s the first album she\'s released since "Hotel Paper" in 2003. The time away from the radio public inspired magazine headlines like "What Happened to Michelle Branch?" upon her return.\nThe new record was co-produced and co-written with Patrick Carney of the Black Keys, Branch\'s boyfriend, who helped Branch zero in on a dusky synth-pop feel. (Carney plays in Branch\'s touring band as well.) There\'s a new-wave gene that\'s expressing itself on Branch\'s latest. But Branch throws in some tender balladry, too. The record is about losing and finding love and growing up. Branch, who had her first hit with "Everywhere" in 2001, had considered quitting music over the past 10 years because of being caught in label limbo, among other things. She grew up as a teen-pop star, and she\'s got a child now and been through a divorce.\nShe\'s matured a bit and she\'s ready for her music to be a more accurate reflection of her life experience and her own voice than to have it be some focus-grouped pop confection. Another side benefit of sitting on the sidelines for a dozen years or so: Branch had a ton of material to choose from for the new record.\nMichelle Branch performs at College Street Music Hall, 238 College St., New Haven, Saturday, Aug. 5, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $25 to $27. collegestreetmusichall.com\n'

S'5 Ways to Ease New-Client Onboarding'

S"When agencies begin working with new clients, first impressions mean everything. Onboarding is one of the initial interactions between a company and its newly won client. It's no surprise, then, that the company's approach affects the client-agency relationship from the very beginning and can have lasting effects moving forward.\nHere are five simple suggestions to ease the onboarding process.\n1. Keep communications open.\nSolving pain points early on is the quickest way to ease the stress of a new client (or a new employee, for that matter). Agencies first must listen well to clients to figure out the main goal. Perhaps this goes without saying, but the client also must listen well to the agency. \nOpen communications across both parties can foster a positive consultant/client structure. The first week working together creates the most impressions and lays the foundation for productive (or not) relationships between the groups.\n2. Make certain the data is accurate. \nTo help clients optimize their business processes, it's important to analyze forward-facing information as well as the data they collect and bring to work sessions. Sometimes the data on a client\xe2\x80\x99s website differs from the client's story.\nFor example, if a client is losing money and needs to figure out why, it's smart to assess business information along with marketing campaigns. Either can help drive more positive traffic toward the client. But inaccurate numbers can lead to faulty information on websites and across collateral materials. Consultants must look behind the messaging to dig into the figures, too. \n3. Write the real story -- with the real numbers.\nNo doubt the client has researched the agency before seeking an outside professional's opinion. In fact, the client might know more about the agency than the agency has anticipated. This actually is a positive sign that the client appreciates the consultant company's culture and philosophy.\nOnce data is compiled, vetted and analyzed, the agency can write a real story that aligns with the client's vision. Numbers can say much about a company, but a story can flesh out even more details.\n4. Devise a strategy to solve pain points.\nEntrepreneurs are famous for identifying and solving pain points before they become chronic issues. Larger companies would be wise to develop this attribute. Smaller agencies tend to have a lower client-to-manager ratio, with greater individual knowledge of clients and more personal connections. This naturally provides ample opportunities to address emerging concerns before conflicts arise.\nSolving pain points the client hadn't truly felt yet elevates the consultant's value and increases the likelihood the client will remain with the agency across a longer time span. \n5. Bring it all together.\nThe previous four techniques uncovered options. Now, it's time to discuss how each can best be optimized to achieve the client's objectives. Consultants can break down what they've learned about the client to create innovative ways of dealing with pain points when they're mere discomforts. This way, the agency develops a process for anticipating issues that may make the client uncomfortable -- and then further proves its worth by handling those aspects before the client has time to feel the sting.\nNext Article\n5 Ways to Optimize Your Ecommerce Campaigns\nRocco Baldassarre\n"

S'Global Tiger Day, often called International Tiger Day, is celebrated on July 29 to give worldwide awareness on the reservation of tigers. It was first created in 2010 at the Saint Petersburg Tiger Summit and has been celebrated since then. This was initiated because the wild tigers are close to extinction.\nThe Tiger Day is to promote the protection and expansion of the wild tigers habitats and to gain support through awareness for tiger conservation. In order to protect tigers and their natural habitat, Tiger Day is celebrated worldwide.\nThe factors that led to the dwindling number of tigers are climate change, habitat loss, hunting and poaching. The Tiger Day aims to protect and expand their habitats and raise awareness of the need for conservation.\nIn the last 10 years, India has seen a steady rise in the number of tigers. According to the 2011 census report, released by the Indian government puts the number of tigers at 1,706, which shows an increase in the number of tigers by about 295.\nAccording to the Wildlife Protection Society of India, "13 tigers were hunted in 2011 as opposed to 30 in 2010, a decline of 57 percent." We should applaud the government of India for all of their efforts in protecting these magnificent big cats. In India, reported tiger deaths related to poaching reached an all time high in 2016.\nThe steps taken by the Government to protect tigers and increase the population numbers are through tiger reserves, punishing poachers with imprisonment and fines, and through effective patrolling strategies. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 by the Government of India. Today, India holds over half the world\'s tiger population. There are around 39 preserves set up across the country to protect tigers and their natural habitat.\nOneIndia News\n'

S'For representational purpose | PTI\nDARJEELING: After weeks of relative peace, violence erupted in the Darjeeling hills as pro-Gorkhaland supporters clashed with police near Sukna area today while their indefinite strike entered the 45th day.\nAccording to Darjeeling district administration sources, pro-Gorkhaland supporters armed with knives, swords and traditional Khukri, forcibly tried to enter Siliguri with the demand that Siliguri be included in the proposed Gorkhaland.\nThe police put up road blocks near the Sukna road crossing and asked them to go back. But the agitators broke the first two barricades and pelted stones at the police.\nPolice used water cannons and mild baton charge to disperse the crowd.\nThe protesters turned violent and set afire some vehicles parked nearby.\nThe pro-Gorkhaland supporters are presently organising a sit-in demonstration on the Sukna-Siliguri road.\nThe GJM leadership has claimed that the police have resorted to firing which was denied by the district administration.\nA huge contingent of police and security forces has moved to the area to control the situation.\nNormal life remained crippled in the Darjeeling hills due to the ongoing indefinite strike to press for separate Gorkhaland state. Barring medicine shops, business establishments, restaurants, hotels, schools and colleges remained closed.\n'

S'Grenoble: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said Friday.\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\nAnother Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n"They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\nAFP\n'

S' New Delhi, July 30 (IANS) Gaurav Gupta\'s couture collection that took references from the "sculptures found in the realm of a mythological forest", looked even more dreamy when actress Aditi Rao Hydari closed the designer\'s show at the ongoing India Couture Week (ICW) here. \n Couture mostly means bridal in India, but the definition of bridal wear has changed, and Gupta just proved that by showcasing his latest collection, "Moondust", at ICW on Saturday.\n "This collection is extremely couture. It\'s inspired by nature, forest, almost like a parallel world which is happening on the moon in a fairytale way.\n "It is all these art like scuptures made into garments which are wearable sculptures. It\'s just about celebrating fantasy," Gupta told reporters here after the show that saw the designer collaborating with luxury boutique studio Klove to bring to life an immersive installation.\n "We got mesh from Italy. We developed laces from scratch. That\'s what makes this collection haute couture," he added.\n He believes India has couture "thriving". "India is one of the places in whole world which consumes couture. It\'s only been consumed in India or the middle east."\n Using his signature fabrics like chiffon, crepe, tulle, net and lace, the collection had pieces with exaggerated shoulders, fishtail gowns, body hugging dresses and much more in colours like grey, blue and green.\n "Many of my brides wear gowns on their special events, or go for an amalgamation of a gown with something Indian. There are new silhouettes, colours and a lot of experimentation within that," he told IANS.\n "Today the brides only wear bridal on their wedding day, for the rest of the days it is new global couture for them," he added.\n And like the evolution of couture, his showstopper Aditi also likes to "evolve".\n "She is not scared to experiment. Within that (what she wears) she finds her personality. She\'s a thinking wearer," Gupta said about the actress, who sported side swept hairstyle and wore a grey gown with a long trail.\n "It\'s very special because GG (Gupta) is one of the first people who encouraged me when I was new ...almost six to seven years ago," she said on closing his show.\n Recalling her initial days in showbiz, she said: "He called me and I went to his studio. I just sat there for the whole day. I took out everything from all his old and new collections. I tried everything on. I felt like a real princess."\n "From that day to this day, I am so close to him. He is very protective of me. It\'s very special because its the first time I am walking for him. And also the collection is called \'Moondust\'," she said.\n And like Gupta, Aditi believes in enchanted forests, unicorns, reindeers and all happy things.\n One could see all the "enchantment" on her garment.\n The day was special for Aditi for one more reason. The poster of her upcoming film "Bhoomi", which is comeback film of actor Sanjay Dutt, was unveiled on Saturday.\n "It\'s special. That is Sanju sir\'s comeback film. I feel lucky to be working with him. There\'s a lot more to come," promised the petite actress, who couldn\'t stop looking at the tall models who walked with her during the show.\n Intimidated by them?\n "Always. They are so tall, I call them giraffe. They are very sweet to me. Whenever I\'ve walked on the ramp, I\'ve got such a lovely energy from everybody."\n --IANS\n nn/sku/ \n'

S'7 Things Smart People Do Frequently--and 6 Things They Avoid at All Costs'

S"When the going gets tough, the mentally strong kick butt and take names.\nBetween trying to succeed in your career goals and trying to find some kind of personal balance, life can be pretty hectic. And when the going gets tough, it's easy to consider giving up or dropping back. If this is you, it's time to take a cue from the mentally strong.\nHere are some common traits mentally strong people share:\nNever give up.\nEveryone makes mistakes, and everyone will fail at something at some time in their lives. Look at failure as a chance to improve at what you do. Failure, not success, is what makes people learn and grow, and be willing to fail again and again in order to soak up as much knowledge as possible.\nEnjoy your own company.\nMentally strong people aren't afraid to be alone, and don't flip out every time they don't have plans or have an opening in their calendars. Instead, they enjoy and even treasure the time they spend alone and use it as downtime to reflect, to plan, and to be productive. Be your own biggest fan and believe that you are in good company, and can be just as happy alone as with others.\nDon't feel entitled--know that you have to work for everything you have\nThe mentally strong don't feel that they world owes them. Know that hard work begets success, and be willing to put in the time and effort to get there.\nKnow that all good things take time.\nBe patient and remember that nothing good happens overnight. Therefore, be patient and in it for the long haul. When the going gets tough, dig in and work harder to apply your energy and time and celebrate each milestone when you can.\nRoll with the punches.\nWhile the rest of the population is stressed bad traffic, silly people and a late flight, the mentally strong know that these factors are generally beyond their control. The only thing you can control is your own response and attitude. How will you choose to react?\nAccept that you can't please everyone.\nStrive to be kind, fair, and to please others where it's appropriate, but know your own rights too! Be unafraid to speak up and do what's right, even if others don't like it. You should be strong enough to withstand the possibility that someone will get upset, but take your confidence from the fact that you are doing what you believe is morally right.\nTake calculated risks.\nCalculated risks are okay for strong people. Do your research, weigh the pros and cons of taking the risks, and envision what the outcome will be before proceeding. Be prepared to accept and deal with the consequences, whatever they might be.\nDon't live in the past--look towards the future.\nThere is no good that can come of reliving a decision you have made over and over again. Strong people know that if they want something to change, they focus on the future, and what can be done. So, accept any lesson that was gained from that past decision and move on with your life.\nLearn from your mistakes.\n... and from others' mistakes, because life is too short to make them all by yourself. A mentally strong person accepts full responsibility for past behavior and is willing to learn from their mistakes. Analyze what you could have done differently and make sure to act accordingly the next time.\nDon't be jealous of others.\nThere's no point in being jealous or resentful of other people's successes, know that others have worked hard for what they have. You should feel happy when other people find their own successes and their own way in their lives.\nIt takes strength of character to be excited for other people. If anything, other people's successes just makes you work harder, and soon you can experience something that they can be proud of too.\nQuit feeling sorry for yourself.\nThere's no time to waste! Self-pity is a waste of energy. Instead, take responsibility for your actions and outcomes, and know that life can be unfair. Taking action is a much better use of your time.\nStop letting others make you feel bad.\nIf someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself, understand that they can only do that if you give them the power to do so. Avoid giving others the power to make you feel inferior. Remember, you are in control of your actions and emotions!\nDon't be afraid of change.\nIn fact, you should embrace change and welcome challenge. Try not to become stagnant in your life. Can you think of someone in your life that you consider to be strong willed? Take a few notes from them and remember that an environment of change and sometimes uncertainty can energize you!\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n"

S'India thrash Sri Lanka by 304 runs to post their biggest win overseas and take a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series\nIndia captain Virat Kohli grins after Umesh Yadav dismisses Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Dhanushka Gunatilaka for 2 on Day Four at Galle. AP\nIt was India\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Test win abroad. Yet, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like one. No one scampered to pluck the souvenir stumps, it was an afterthought. No one swooped on Mohammed Shami, whose catch ended Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s fitful resistance. No one squealed or scowled, let alone burst into a delirious high-fives. The Indians celebrating their 304-run win and their 1-0 lead in the series resembled a bunch of orderly convent boys out on an excursion.\nIt was in sync with how the match had meandered on after Shikhar Dhawan\xe2\x80\x99s breathtaking hundred. Not that the match crawled thereafter \xe2\x80\x93 both sides still batted at brisk pace and Virat Kohli scripted his 17th hundred \xe2\x80\x93 but it was considerably less thrilling, devoid of the customary ebbs and flows of Test matches in Galle. The fact that this was the weakest of Sri Lankan sides in the last two decades, further defected by unfortunate injuries to their batting tyro and their skipper, too needs at least a mention here.\nIt was also a sign of how the team has metamorphosed into a ruthless winning machine, at least in the subcontinent. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason such canters didn\xe2\x80\x99t excite them any longer. The most definitive aspect of this win is that it was made to look routine. Even making things appear ho-hum is an art, and indicates how India has come up in leaps, since the last time they departed this idyllic port town.\nThis is a team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blink in adversity, they have a man who puts up his hand for every occasion. The biggest difference, Kohli sees is how the team has begun to execute their plans methodically. The roles are defined and executed with a cutting-edge precision.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, it was more of talking a lot about plans and planning a lot about how to go a certain way against a certain player. Now I think guys are very comfortable with their skills and how they have to bowl and where they have to bowl and what fields they want. Also, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nNo longer naive\nTo put it other words, they are no longer naive or dependent. If the Sri Lankans had applied fastidiously enough, they could have defied India to at least the end of fourth day. Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja embodied that meticulous execution of plans Kohli was raving about. The build-up to Sri Lankan opener Upul Tharanga\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal by Sami was a classic case. He gave him a classical working over. He began the over with the one that angled away from him around the stumps.\nHe opens the bat phase for squeezing a boundary. The next is angled delivery straying into the pads. The next was the sucker ball-slanting in, a touch fuller, cajoling the batsman for the drive, then seaming away at the last moment, thus inducing the edge. It was a pity that Kohli spilled the catch. But Shami knew he had his man\xe2\x80\x99s number. Two balls later, he angled one in outside the off-stump, before making it cackle back a shade to brush his inside edge. Tharanga sized up the angle, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t account for the seam movement.\nJadeja\xe2\x80\x99s deception was softer. Unlike Ravichandran Ashwin who took time to get a measure of the wicket, Jadeja had the wisdom to mix up the lengths. He would continuously bowl briskly at the stumps, before sowing the doubts with a slower, more flighted delivery that spat a little away. It was the continuous pressure he exerted on Niroshan Dickwella that prompted him to attempt a fatal sweep off Ashwin, which broke Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s last lingering hopes of stretching the match, and perhaps accomplishing a miraculous jailbreak.\nTheir purposeful batting would have, at least momentarily, concerned Kohli. For he has seen unseemly pairs taking the game away from India, like Roston Chase and Shane Dowrich in Kington, or Peter Handscomb and Shaun Marsh in Ranchi. But for a team progressively on the upward curve, they ensured such defiance don\xe2\x80\x99t recur. Maybe, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t show much emotions, but inwardly they have must have been relieved that the spooky ghosts of the past have been laid to rest.\n'

S'Kolkata, July 29 (IANS) Three more flood-related deaths were reported in West Bengal, taking the toll to 31, even as Indian Air Force helicopters dropped food and medicines in marooned areas and rescued nine people in West Midnapore district.\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the situation had improved but could worsen again if more water was released from the dams.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree more persons have died in the last 24 hours. The toll since July 21 (when the heavy rains started) is 31,\xe2\x80\x9d a state government official said but did not give the details as to where and how the fatalities occurred.\nAround 2,067 relief camps were opened in the 11 flood-hit districts where 165 villages spread across 104 blocks had been inundated due to heavy monsoon rains and release of water from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dams since last weekend.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe (flood) situation has got better but the problem will again rise if more water is released. The quantum of water released was more than the amount during the 1978 floods,\xe2\x80\x9d Banerjee said while leaving the state secretariat Nabanna.\nAsked about the stranded people in Pratappur village of West Midnapore district\xe2\x80\x99s Ghatal block, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cMany persons were rescued from Ghatal and we are trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA Defence Ministry spokesperson said nine people, including three women and five children, were rescued from the area by air force helicopters that took off from the Barrackpore air base.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine persons were winched up and food and medicines dropped,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesperson said.\nThe state government official said the situation had improved in the affected districts due to the rainfall receding and the DVC releasing less water.\nMeanwhile, the DVC withdrew the yellow flood warning message for Panchet dam in neighbouring Jharkhand.\n\xe2\x80\x94 IANS\nbdc/ssp/nir/rn\n'

S'Dinesh Karthik Conundrum In Indian Cricket'

S' Indian cricket has always been embracing quandaries in their cricketing expeditions, from coach selection to team selection this side has been cruising through a seesaw ride these days. The entire matter expands its wings when the slew of cricketers make their way to the dugout hoping to unleash their onslaught in the imminent chance given but matters drown deeper when all players in the eleven in order to establish their position in the team ended up giving their best shot in the middle. Something similar to this has yet been unfolded inside the Indian dugout as Dinesh Karthik and his counting of days for another opportunity to play wearing India\xe2\x80\x99s jersey is still in motion.\nHindustan Times\nKarthik already displayed a rich vein of form in 50-over cricket for Tamil Nadu which culminated in two title wins for the state \xe2\x80\x93 Vijay Hazare Trophy and Deodhar Trophy where Karthik recorded centuries in either final. Indian ODI team especially the middle order seems to be fully packed up with big names like Yuvraj Singh, Ravinder Jadeja, MS Dhoni and also Hardik Pandya along with Kedar Jadhav has been the matter of dilemma for Karthik\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the eleven. A possible return of Karthik to Indian team can be seen through an additional wicket keeper as he was placed in the Champions trophy squad.\nNDTV Sports\nThis ray of hope, unfortunately, ignited his craving fire a little as during Champions trophy we all have witnessed how he had been put to rest for the entire Championship stint even after scoring an unbeaten 94 in the 2nd practice match before the official tour scratching the surface. Yaa! his slump in batting potential could be the reason for such ignorance but after displaying his reliable batting strength along with the skipper Kohli during the practice match was indeed the worth of a call to the eleven. Karthik has a sound technique and is more than capable of playing big shots at the end. He also has the experience to step into the shoes of Yuvraj at No. 4.\nAlso in lieu of Dhoni, 32-year-old could be a lucrative option for Indian perspective specifically as an extra wicket keeper option. As we all have witness hitherto that Dhoni\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught has been waning these days hence in such circumstances Karthik could be cropped up to the business. And also he himself seemed confident of earning Kohli\xe2\x80\x99s attention regarding his comeback to the team so it is thought to be imminent that we will witness Karthik playing for Indian cricket team very soon as he is an absolute player for all formats so his contribution in the team could result in a triumphant manner.\n'

S'Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, teamed up with colleagues from the Harvard Business School in Boston, MA, to try to answer the question, "Can money buy us happiness?"\nDr. Ashley Whillans, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, and her colleagues found that money does buy happiness when it is invested in time-saving expenses, such as hiring a cleaner or a nanny.\nThe results of the study were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAccording to studies from across the globe, researchers note that in countries where personal income is on the rise, free time has become something of a luxury. Lack of free time is reportedly responsible for a decreased sense of well-being, susceptibility to anxiety, and insomnia.\nWith this in mind, Dr. Whillans and her colleagues set out to test whether or not spending money to acquire more time - by hiring someone to help with household duties and any unpleasant chores, for example - could positively impact people\'s lives.\nTime-saving investments bring happiness\nThey initially analyzed data sourced from 4,469 respondents from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United States.\nIn the U.S., they reviewed information from 366 freelancers who sourced their work using a major online platform, as well as 1,260 regular working U.S. adults, who were representative of the general population.\nIn Denmark, the data came from 467 representative workers, and in Canada, they were collected from a similar population sample of 326 respondents. From the Netherlands, they evaluated 1,232 nationally representative workers, as well as a population of 818 millionaires.\nAll the respondents at this stage had to provide information about any money they spent on a regular basis to hire helpers and free up time for themselves.\nThe researchers found that more than 28 percent of the participants invested money in time-saving expenses each month. These respondents also reported feeling happier and more satisfied with their lives.\nWhat surprised Dr. Whillans and her colleagues was that the same degree of satisfaction was felt by people who invested in domestic help regardless of their personal income.\n"The benefits of buying time aren\'t just for wealthy people. We thought the effects might only hold up for people with quite a bit of disposable income, but to our surprise, we found the same effects across the income spectrum," says senior author Dr. Elizabeth Dunn, from the University of British Columbia.\nFew people buy time out\nDr. Whillans and her team sought to consolidate their results by recruiting a further 1,802 U.S. participants, to whom they rephrased their initial questions so that "time-saving investments" would be defined less restrictively. Their initial findings still held.\nFinally, the researchers also decided to conduct a field experiment, in which 60 working adults from Canada were randomly allocated $40 for two consecutive weekends. They were then asked to spend this money first on time-saving investments, and then on a material purchase.\nIt was found that the participants felt happier at the weekend when they had invested the money on help with chores, which allowed them to have more free time.\nHowever, the researchers were in for another surprise when they noticed that relatively few people, even counting those with significant expendable incomes, chose to spend their money on time-freeing purchases.\nOut of the 818 Dutch millionaires that they surveyed, a little less than half declared that they never invested in purchases that allowed them to avoid unpleasant and time-consuming chores.\nWhen they asked a further sample of 98 working adults how they would spend an expendable $40, only 2 percent of them reported that they would invest in free time.\nDr. Whillans suggests that we should try thinking about our investments differently, and buy ourselves more time when we can.\n"Lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences."\nDr. Elizabeth Dunn\n'

S'FREMONT, Calif. - Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Friday the Model 3 had over half a million advance reservations as he handed over the first 30 to employee buyers, setting the stage for the biggest test yet of the company\'s strategy to become a profitable, mass market electric car maker.\nOutside Tesla\'s Fremont, California factory, Musk showed off the $35,000 base vehicle with a range of 220 miles (350 km) on a charge that marks a departure from the company\'s earlier luxury electric cars.\nHours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be "quite a challenge" to build the car during the early days of production.\n"We\'re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell," Musk told journalists.\nThe over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits. Any new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said.\nA longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a 15-inch touchstream display to the right of the driver.\nTesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production.\nWere Tesla to produce, and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States.\nProduction delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla\'s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year. Musk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems.\nTesla has burned through over $2 billion in cash so far this year ahead of the launch. A troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations.\nTesla\'s share price has surged 54 percent since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla\'s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\nUntil now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman CEO who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account. Now loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the United States.\nThe Model 3 is part of Musk\'s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Joe White and Lisa Shumaker)\n'

S'A Rural Entrepreneurship Centre, the first of its kind in the whole country, will be set up in Meghalaya, as part of its initiative of promoting rural entrepreneurship. \nThe Meghalaya government has conceived a scheme of Rural Entrepreneurship Centres to be set up in different blocks across the State.\nThe first of such centres will be set up in Nangapa under Songsak Community and Rural Development Block in East Garo Hills for which Chief MinisterMukul Sangma laid the foundation stone in the presence of Minister for School Literacy and Education Deborah C Marak. The main objective of this scheme is to provide farmers and rural entrepreneurs with necessary industrial and social infrastructure to attract entrepreneurs for starting up various small scale industries.\n In his address the Chief Minister Mukul Sangma said the Rural Entrepreneurship Centre will be the first of its kind in the whole country, adding that the scheme was conceived to "empower our people and make them capable of becoming big entrepreneurs at par with other businessmen of the country.\nHe justified selection of Nangapa for setting up of this centre saying that the farmers of the area has been hard working and has done considerably better than others while taking up schemes provided by Agriculture and Horticulture departments.\nDr Sangma informed the gathering about the Incubation centres that would be set up across the state which would provide handholding support to new entrepreneurs, adding that the potential entrepreneurs can identify what business they want to take up leveraging on the resources available around them and they will be trained accordingly and given all necessary support so they do have to depend on middlemen for marketing their products. The chief minister also lamented the fact that the State had moved very slow in terms of development in the past years and called upon the departments and officials concerned to expedite all development projects.\nIndicating that the pace of development has picked up in the recent times, he highlighted a number of projects that are progressing fast including the construction of PMGSY roads and informed that the government has already approved 181 roads across the State to be funded by World Bank.

S"Washington D.C. [USA], July 30 (ANI): Beware! Heart disease patients are twice as likely to suffer an early death if they suffer depression, warns a study.\nResearchers tracked more than 24,000 patients for 10 years and found that post-coronary artery disease depression was the single biggest predictor of death.\nLead author Dr Heidi May said that no matter how long or how short it was, patients were found to have twice the risk of dying compared to those who did not have a follow-up diagnosis of depression.\nMay stated that depression was the strongest risk factor for dying, compared to any other risk factors we evaluated, including age, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, or having a heart attack or stroke.\nThat remained the case even after they adjusted for factors such as age, race, diabetes, or high blood pressure.\nThe team analysed 24,138 patients, who underwent angiographies, which determined they had coronary artery disease.\nTo detect subsequent depression, the researchers used standardised diagnostic coding system.\nThe patients with depression were placed into subcategories based on how long after their heart disease diagnosis the depression was identified.\nIn all, 15 percent, or 2,646 patients, were diagnosed with depression at some point during follow-up.\nOf those, most of them (37 percent) were diagnosed with depression for more than five years after their first heart event, but the two diagnosis were linked.\nThe second most likely scenario was being diagnosed within a year of the first heart event, which was the case for 27 percent of patients with depression.\nThe rest were diagnosed between one and five years after their first event.\nAccording to researchers there are hormonal changes and electro-functioning changes which affect the heart's functioning as people who suffer depression have reduced levels of serotonin released in their brain.\nDr May said emphasized the importance of continual screening of depression for all heart disease patients and said that the patients who have depression need to be treated for it to improve not only their long-term risks but their quality of life.\nThe research appears in European Heart Journal.

S' Shorter sleep was also linked to reduced levels of HDL cholesterol (Photo: AFP)\nWashington: For a healthy body, you may have to sleep for seven to nine hours daily, as Briton researchers have warned that people who sleep for just six hours a night have a waist measurement that is three cm greater than individuals who get nine hours of sleep.\nAccording to researchers from the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, adults who have poor sleep patterns are more likely to be overweight and obese and have poorer metabolic healthsuch as diabetes-major health challenges facing the NHS.\nThe findings showed that people, who were sleeping an average of six hours a night, had a waist measurement that was three cm greater than individuals who were getting nine hours of sleep a night.\nLead study author Dr Laura Hardie said that not only the team looked at the links between sleep duration, diet and weight, but also other indicators of overall metabolic health such as blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood sugar and thyroid function.\nThey analysed 1,615 adults who reported how long they slept and kept records of food intake.\nThe participants had blood samples taken and their weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure recorded.\n Another researcher Greg Potter said that obesity contributes to the development of many diseases, most notably Type-2 diabetes.\nShorter sleep was also linked to reduced levels of HDL cholesterol in the participants\' blood-another factor that can cause health problems.\nHDL cholesterol is \'good\' cholesterol that helps remove \'bad\' fat from the circulation. In doing so, high HDL cholesterol levels protect against conditions such as heart disease.\nSenior study author Dr Laura Hardie said that because they found that adults who reported sleeping less than their peers were more likely to be overweight or obese, their findings highlight the importance of getting enough sleep.\n"How much sleep we need differs between people, but the current consensus is that seven to nine hours is best for most adults," Hardie added.\nThe results appear in the journal PLOS ONE.\n'

S'Mouse pups derived from sperm that was freeze-dried and stored on the International Space Station for nine months.\n Mouse sperm preserved on the International Space Station for nine months gave rise to healthy pups, a new study reveals.\n This finding suggests that animals, perhaps including humans, can one day reproduce safely in space, researchers said.\n This work also raises the possibility of a "doomsday vault" for sperm in space that could help preserve animal species from disasters on Earth, much as the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, does for plant species. The sperm-vault idea is similar to one depicted in a novel by the author of "A Game of Thrones," scientists added. [The Human Body in Space: 6 Weird Facts]\n If humans ever want to live permanently in space, they will need to make sure they and any farm animals they bring with them can reproduce, said study senior author Teruhiko Wakayama, a reproductive biologist at the University of Yamanashi in Kofu, Japan, and his colleagues.\n However, outer space is dangerous. For instance, the average daily radiation dose on the International Space Station (ISS) is more than 100 times higher than that on Earth, and could damage the sperm and eggs that give rise to most animal offspring, the researchers said.\n To examine the damage that space radiation could do to potential animal offspring, the researchers shipped samples of freeze-dried mouse sperm into space. (Freeze-drying preserves items by rapidly freezing them and then subjecting them to a high vacuum that dehydrates them. Freeze-dried ice cream is often known as "astronaut ice cream.")\n This mouse sperm was stored on the ISS for 288 days, from August 2013 to May 2014, at temperatures of minus 139 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 95 degrees Celsius). The sperm was then returned to Earth and compared with freeze-dried samples that were preserved on Earth during the same time under similar conditions.\n The researchers found evidence that space-preserved sperm did experience slightly more DNA damage than Earth-preserved samples.\n "This was a little bit surprising, because the storage period was only nine months," Wakayama told Space.com.\n The scientists then employed in vitro fertilization techniques, using both the space- and Earth-preserved sperm to produce embryos that were transferred into female mice. The average birth rates from the two kinds of samples were comparable, and the ratio of male to female in the two kinds of pups fell within the normal range, the researchers said. Furthermore, analyses of the pups\' genomes revealed only minor differences between the two types of mice, and the pups from space-preserved sperm went on to develop into adults with normal fertility.\n All in all, the researchers said their findings suggest that the DNA damage seen in the space-preserved sperm got largely repaired in the embryos after fertilization. Previous research done over nearly 40 years has found that egg cells have a strong potential for repairing damaged DNA, the scientists explained.\n These findings suggest that healthy animal offspring could be produced using sperm preserved in space and artificial insemination techniques, the researchers said. Many domesticated animals are already produced using artificial insemination. \n "If humans live in space for a very long time, then we will want to eat beefsteak," Wakayama said.\n The scientists noted that freeze-dried sperm can be preserved at room temperature for up to two years, and in a freezer almost indefinitely. This raises the possibility that a sperm bank in space could help protect animal species from catastrophes on Earth, the researchers said. Wakayama cited a similar idea that was brought up in the science-fiction book "Tuf Voyaging" by George R.R. Martin, the author of "A Game of Thrones."\n For example, the spaces within lava tubes on the moon are cold, protected from space radiation by thick bedrock and isolated from Earth. "Therefore, sperm could be preserved forever" on the moon, Wakayama said. Still, he added that this notion "is too preliminary to say it is a good idea or it is possible."\n The scientists detailed their findings online today (May 22) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n'

S'  By: Pallavi Aman Singh \n New Delhi [India], Jul 29 (ANI): Once considered a  behind-closed-doors affair, the powerful, emotional and beautiful  journey of birth has now turned into an up-and-coming niche as capturing this highest form of expression can be quite an art in itself.\n The days of dads-to-be being confined to the waiting rooms may have been long gone, but partners with an iPhone don\'t necessarily click the best shots with those  shaky hands. Here\'s when a birth photographer comes into the picture, leaving new parents free to live in the moment.\n Usually seen as just taking pictures of the emerging baby, birth photography has more to it. It is about capturing the raw and real emotions of the event and un-photoshopped moment as it unfolds - be it a mother\'s strained, gasping face or her bulging neck veins.\n Blurring the lines between public and private domains, this latest trend is turning a traditionally hush-hush event into something to be captured on camera and shared with a wider audience.\n "Birth photography is a concept that revolves around capturing the miracle of childbirth in its most gracious form," professional photographer  Urshita Saini, founder of InfLens, told ANI. "People talk about birth being a miracle; all I do is describe it in the form of pictures."\n "Be it the bond that a husband and a wife share during labour, the first time the baby steps into the world, its first expressions, its crying, its laughter, mother and baby\'s first look at each other, the father\'s expressions when he sees the baby for the first time, the family\'s bond after coming of the new member, I capture it all," she added.\n Already a trend in the West, birth photography is gradually gaining popularity in India with parents choosing to show the beauty in birth instead of waiting to photograph a perfectly posed newborn at a studio.\n Talking on the same, Urshita said, "People here, once made aware of the concept and the sanctity of the pictures, get interested in the concept."\n "At times it does happen that people opt out after being interested mainly because they do not see this as a common activity online. I call this the \'fear of the unknown.\' But we are trying to connect with more and more people and make them aware, through multiple channels and we have been getting a great response," she continued.\n In a country like India, where there are a lot of superstitions around photographing a newborn and a pregnant woman, how far can a concept like this reach? "Yes there are superstitions; not showing the baby to anyone outside the family for 40 days, not clicking the pictures for the first 3 months, etc, but this is restricted to only certain people," Urshita answered.\n "And we have realized that this prejudice is not dependent on the strata that the family belongs to. It completely depends on the mindset and exposure to the family. But I am sure even this group of people will catch up once they see the world around them enjoying these memories," she added.\n Sure, birth-photography may be a challenging affair in India as too many taboos exist around it, but the photogs find the experience equally satisfying.\n "Well honestly, I am sure I face the same challenges and benefits that any other photographer outside India faces," Urshita said, noting, "Everybody gets rejections; everybody has to have the patience and the strong willpower needed to withstand the time and toil of capturing the birth of a child. But yes, I do get importance and recognition for my profession, and I also get applauded for my persistence to spread this concept in India."\n "I have carried out more than 30 birth shoots. During my first shoot, there were a lot of circumstances that I did not foresee that made me realize how birth photography needs me to be extremely strong mentally. So yes, in short, the first birth shoot was one of a kind experience for me," she added.\n Moreover, this profession of providing new parents with incredible memories in the form of pictures so that they can relive the whole experience over and over again comes with some unique challenges.\n "Dealing with the superstitions is a big challenge that currently limits our audience," she noted, adding, "In the  operation theatres (OT), we need to ensure that both the photographer and the equipment are sterile."\n "On the photography front, taking photographs in low light and being quick on your feet to ensure that you don\'t miss a single moment are important factors that define the quality of pictures," Urshita continued.\n For the photographers, the obstacles don\'t end here. "Initially, it will be challenging as people are not aware of the concept and are not sure what kind of photographs will be clicked. There are chances that parents might shun off the concept considering the fear of any health complication of the baby, the privacy of the family or the  superstitions," Urshita explained.\n "However, with time the photographer will learn the trick of persuading the parents and ensuring them of proper health and privacy of the family. Once the photographer is able to learn on this persuading expertise, nothing can stop him/her from rising up with this trend," she said.\n Captured mostly in portrait mode, this genre of photography is all about taking shots during the labour hours till the baby is out of the mother\'s womb and it takes a lot of effort to get that perfect click.\n "There is a need to understand that as a photographer, one should be able to carry his/her work unnoticed. It\'s necessary to ensure that the doctor or any of the medical staff and especially the mother is not being disturbed during the birthing process," she said.\n She further said, "Unsatisfied customers are a result of demands not met properly or some confusion that pertained even after shoots. Thankfully, no such thing happened with me yet. But, we at  InfLens, make sure that parents are completely made aware of the concept, and the photo shoot is done in accordance with their demands in best possible way."\n So, how does birth photography differ from images taken immediately after birth? "Babies change very quickly in the initial first hour of their birth. It takes at least 20 minutes for the baby to come out of the labour room/ OT. Till the time the baby comes out of the OT, it would have changed; its face less swollen, feet stretched out, the crooked nose would be back in shape, etc," Urshita replied.\n "Furthermore, inside the OT, one can capture the expression of the mother once she sees her baby for the very first time. Moreover, the \'First Moments\' of the baby are inside the labour room/ OT. So it becomes imperative for the Photographer to be present there for locking these precious moments," she continued.\n Can someone make his/her living solely documenting childbirth? "No. As of now in India, this is not something that can help you sustain a livelihood. Unlike, weddings or birthdays, this is one genre that people are not aware of, and hence the photographer might land up with very few shoots," Urshita said. "But this is what I and my partner, Sahil is out to change. We are aiming at promoting and educating people about this concept and the importance of preserving these memories, as much as we can."\n Be it photoshopping sonograms onto pregnant bellies or clicking a newborn attached to placenta, babies have become the new favourite for photographers and are ruling our lives, the Internet.\n According to Urshita, "It is a novel idea of getting photographs clicked with a photoshopped sonogram of the baby on the naked belly. And, I feel it relates pretty well to my genre of birth photography as it can be well used to portray a \'before\' and \'after\' scenario."\n Those who are still trying to get around the idea of having a complete stranger documenting a very private moment, MRI birth videos could be your next best option in the future.\n Talking about whether or not MRI birth videos can give birth photographers a run for money, she said, "No. MRI birth videos can be a part of the process of capturing the birth of the baby. But, birth photography majorly happens just after the baby enters the world. The expressions and the reactions of the parents, as well as the baby, are in focus. Moreover, MRI videos are a representation of how the baby was born while the birth photographers capture what happens before and after the birth of the baby."\n Mastering this art isn\'t that easy and so Urshita listed down some points that could help the budding lensmen.\n She noted, "Birth photography is one genre that is very different from any other kind of photography for a very simple reason, i.e., you cannot predict your shots. You have to be prepared for the unexpected all the time. Yes, photography is the first step to being successful at this concept since you need to know what instrument will best suit your environment; you need to work in low light, etc. Because flashes are a strict no no."\n - Have immense patience.\n - Look for any and every movement inside the Labour room/ OT.\n - Focus on the expressions of the mother, the macro shots of the baby and its features.\n - Try to capture as many expressions of the baby and the parents as you can.\n "Keep in mind that you are there to photograph the process and not for interfering or obstructing it. If one ever forgets this rule and interferes in the medical procedure, one\'s career gets finished then and there only. Make sure your presence in the labor room/OT is not disturbing the doctor, any of the medical staff and most importantly the mother," she added. "Patience is the biggest virtue that one needs to succeed at. Also one needs to understand that every birth is unique and none of the things happening there can ever be in one\'s control. There\'s a need to be quick with the work and ensure that no disturbance is caused to anybody in the OT."\n Urshita concluded, "Birth photography is a new concept in India. But we are pretty sure that it would pick up and soon more people would be interested in getting it done to preserve the first moments of their baby in this world. These are memories that parents, as well as the baby when it grows up, would cherish for a lifetime." (ANI)\n'

S'Photo shows rescuers beside working at the site where the remains were found\n GRENOBLE: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said. \n  Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday. \n  "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg. \n In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. \n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people. \n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts. \n "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. \n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". \n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps. \n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. \n'

S'India have aced the \'boring\' processes\nIndia have now developed their own style of winning Tests. If West Indies\' wins in the 80s were stamped with flamboyance, and Australia\'s at the start of the century underlined ruthlessness and all-round strength, India\'s wins seem to stem from playing to their script, over and over again till it becomes boring. \nIf one had to write a guide on how to win Test matches, especially in the sub-continent, the current India set up would be the perfect author. They\'ve found the perfect marriage of old-school Test cricket with the best of the contemporary. It has the explosiveness and the slow grind in equal measure. It has very little of the unpredictable and more of the routine. The term often used for the process to getting there, by the team itself is \'boring\'.\nIndia is far from being a boring team, of course. They have some of the most established players, and have mixed it well with ones who are earmarked to take it forward. They vaunt of some of the most exciting cricketers in the world. And the cricket is as ruthless as can be. But all this has been because they have found the \'boring\' route to making it right.\nBatting big in the first innings is spoken off with the utmost importance in Test cricket, and India have made a habit out of it. In the last year, they had scores in excess of 400, in their first innings, 11 times. And they have a great mixture of players who can help them \'bat big\'. Murali Vijay is the classical Test opener, and is a perfect ally to the attacking KL Rahul. The current back-up pair of Abhinav Mukund and Shikhar Dhawan has the exact traits, too. In Pujara, they have a number three who plays every innings like his life depended on it - a very useful characteristic to have for a player who might have to walk in to bat after the wicket of an opener. Virat Kohli is pure magic on his day, while Ajinkya Rahane is able to alternate between playing the attacking innings or stemming the rot as needed. Then they have their slew of allrounders who are capable of piling on more misery or putting a plug to the one they are in.\nAgainst Sri Lanka in Galle, the way they went about their innings was true to script. Dhawan attacked early and flattened the opposition. Mukund failed, but Pujara gained from Dhawan\'s aggression and in the shadows, notched up another hundred. Kohli failed, but Rahane cashed in. And the lower order attacked to get India to 600 runs. In the second innings, Dhawan and Pujara failed, but the players who had not done well in the first, came to the party. Kohli slammed his 17th Test hundred, while Mukund made a career-best 81.\nThen with the ball, they again stuck to a boring script. There was no need for them to go out of the box at all, even when things weren\'t really going their way. Their pace bowlers made all the early noise, taking wickets to breach the fort early in the innings, and then the spinners took over. When the wickets didn\'t fall, they stayed patient and dried up the runs. There was no panicking, no drop in intensity, no change whatsoever. India had their plans to work on, and had the runs to play with. Twice in the innings, the tide turned, somewhat, and Sri Lanka eked out a fightback, but India were able to nip it in the bud. Again, when the spinners couldn\'t wipe the tail out, Hardik Pandya was able to.\nIn the second innings, it was another repeat. Shami and Umesh dented the Sri Lankans early with a wicket each, and put India right on top. Then the spinners took over. Even as Dimuth Karunaratne, first with Kusal Mendis and then with Niroshan Dickwella, defied them, India knew they had no reason to worry unduly. As a watcher from the outside, it was almost as if India had sucked out the drama out of the game. They waited for the breakthrough, and once they got it, finished their job with minimum fuss.\n"We had to work hard for getting all the wickets that we did. I think the bowlers came up with different plans, persisted with long enough to get those breakthroughs and that\'s something that always helps at the beginning of a series to get a victory on a surface which is not offering much and that really gives the team the confidence of doing it once more if we get a surface like that," Kohli said after the match.\nIt\'s his preferred way of winning things, and that has come from the team understanding what works best for themselves.\n"Now I think guys are very comfortable with their skills and how they have to bowl and where they have to bowl and what fields they want. That I think is the biggest change that I see (from Galle 2015). They are more confident in their own abilities because of having performed consistently in the last two years. Plus, they know what they have to do on the pitch to get people out now which is the most important factor.\n"Especially in Test matches, if you are not getting wickets, then how to contain runs or how to create opportunities to get wickets. Even batsmen have become smarter now. You don\'t need to necessarily tell someone how to bat or how to plan an innings. They understand, they prepare themselves really well, so guys have become more professional in the last two years and they understand how Test matches are won. That understanding of the game is something that has come along a long way in the last three years."\nWith that kind of belief and understanding, it is tough for a team to slither into panic. As long as they do the \'boring\' part right, India will be impossible to beat.\nThere was no need for any intimidation. For a novel field. For a breathtaking catch. Or for a folly. India\'s process would eventually work. And in Galle it showed. The win may have been unremarkable, but it was only because India carve their wins that way now.\n'

S'Quite a well-known Chinese ballad goes like this: \xe2\x80\x9cUnder boundless sky, on vast plains, cows and sheep can be seen when the wind blows and grass lowers.\xe2\x80\x9d This song has been repeatedly synonymous with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This region is famous for its prairies in China.\n In all these years, many poems, hymns and songs are composed to eulogize the natural beauty of the Inner Mongolia, like the prairie in Ulgai. This region is particularly amazing and perfect for travelers from July to August, when the tall grasslands hook up to the horizon.\n Nevertheless, tourists can take the pleasure of this beautiful land almost in all seasons of the year. In the month of May, rhododendron flowers are found all over the hills and fields in Arxan. It tells everyone that spring has come! Inner Mongolia greets dazzling autumn in the month of September, as it is the most stunning period for the forests.\n Last year at the time of National Day holiday, approximately 200,000 people had visited Ejin Banner in Alxa League located in eastern Inner Mongolia. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite an admired tourist destination. According to officials, the yellow leaves and the blue sky epitomize each other\xe2\x80\x99s radiance to a tee, which has been praised by tourists as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most beautiful autumn scenes in China\xe2\x80\x9d.\n'

S' With its premiere on July 30, we\'re just a couple of days away from finally seeing the new Top Gear America. But you won\'t have to wait that long to get a quick taste of the show on BBC America. We have a clip to share with you, and it\'s of actor and now Top Gear America host William Fichtner driving a Ford F-150 Raptor in the desert. This is an exclusive clip you\'ll only see on Autoblog.\n He seems to like the truck, saying it\'s "the American dream incarnate," and "a fighter jet on four wheels." It does look about as majestic as a bald eagle out in its natural habitat. While plenty of that is because of the inherent coolness of the truck, part of it is probably due to the way the truck is filmed. It appears that Top Gear America will have a high level of production value, with beautifully framed shots and lighting.\n When the full episode airs on Sunday, Fichtner, the man behind Finding Steve McQueen, will be joined by two other hosts, Antron Brown and Tom "Wookie" Ford. Brown is a drag racer who first raced motorcycles before taking on Top Fuel drag cars in 2008. He took home his first Top Fuel championship in 2012. Ford has been in the automotive journalism biz for quite a while. He\'s presently an associate editor for Top Gear magazine and was previously at CAR magazine. He also has worked on a number of automotive-related TV shows, including gone, but not forgotten, Fifth Gear.\n'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): Friday\'s landmark verdict by Pakistan\'s Supreme Court to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from holding office and finding him guilty for accumulating assets beyond his known sources of income, may have a resounding impact on that country\'s political landscape, but by no stretch of imagination, can we expect Pakistan\'s foreign or defence policy towards India undergoing any change.\nNo change either should be expected whatsoever in the status or standing of the Pakistan Army or its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency vis-a-vis policy towards India.\nAs such, the quad erat demonstrandum can only be expected to be business as usual. India, needless to stress, must maintain its guard and keep its powder dry in the wake of the changes taking place across the border.\nNo matter who replaces Sharif, there will be no change with regard to dealing with various terrorist organizations operating from Pakistan\'s soil and their leaders.\nPakistan\'s policies towards Afghanistan and Bangladesh, where its terror is being exported, will also very likely be status quo. And, as far as China is concerned, the latter will ensure that its interests in Pakistan are not affected.\nThe Panama Papers were an unprecedented leak of 11.5million files in 2016, from the database of the world\'s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca.\nThe records were obtained from an anonymous source by the German newspaper S\xc3\xbcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which in turn shared them with a large network of international partners.\nThe documents reveal how in various ways the rich and powerful can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes.\nTwelve national leaders are among 143 politicians, their families and close associates from around the world, who are known to have been using offshore tax havens.\nAmong national leaders with offshore wealth was Pakistan\'s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nThe high-profile scandal is about alleged money laundering by Sharif in 1990s, during his two tenures as prime minister. He used the money accumulated to purchase assets in the United Kingdom, which included four expensive flats in Park Lane, London.\nInformation about the assets surfaced through the leak of the Panama Papers last year. It was revealed that several offshore companies were owned by three of Sharif\'s children.\nFollowing petitions filed by the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Awami Muslim League and Jamaat-e-Islami, in October 2016, a six-member Joint Investigation Team was set up by Pakistan\'s Supreme Court in May 2017, with the mandate to probe the Sharif family for allegedly failing to provide the trail of money used to buy properties in London in 1990s.\nInvestigating the charges against Sharif and his family, the JIT submitted its report to the court stating that the lifestyles of Sharif and his children were beyond their known sources of income, and recommended filing of a new corruption case against them.\nSharif dismissed the report as a "bundle of baseless allegations" and refused to quit, despite demands to do so from several quarters, including opposition political parties.\nThe apex court, which concluded hearing the case on July 21, reserved its verdict for July 28, and now, we all know what the outcome is.

S'Twenty-nine Indian cities and towns, including Delhi and capitals of nine states, fall under "severe" to "very severe" seismic zones, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). \n A majority of these places are in the Himalayas, one of the most seismically active regions in the world. \n Delhi, Patna (Bihar), Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir), Kohima (Nagaland), Puducherry, Guwahati (Assam), Gangtok (Sikkim), Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Imphal (Manipur) and Chandigarh fall under seismic zones IV and V. \n These cities have a combined population of over three crore. \n The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has classified different regions in the country into zones II to V, taking into consideration earthquake records, tectonic activities and damage caused, the director of the NCS, Vineet Gauhlat, said. \n The NCS, which records earthquakes and carries out studies pertaining to microzonation of cities, comes under the India Meteorological Department (IMD). \n Seismic microzonation is the process of subdividing a region into smaller areas having different potential for hazardous earthquake effects. \n Zone II is considered the least seismically active, while Zone V is the most active. Zone IV and V fall under "severe" to "very severe" categories respectively. \n Zone V includes the entire northeastern region, parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkhand, the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, parts of north Bihar and the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. \n Parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Sikkim, northern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and a small part of Maharashtra fall under Zone IV. \n Bhuj, which was struck by a massive earthquake in 2001 in which 20,000 people were killed, Chandigarh, Ambala, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Roorkee fall under zones IV and V. \n Kusala Rajendran, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and an expert on paleoseismology, earthquake recurrence and active tectonics, said most of the cities in the list have a high population density and fall in the Indo-Gangetic plains. \n "The Himalayan arc, stretching from the upper Assam region to Jammu and Kashmir, is known to be a high seismic zone and these cities in the Indo-Gangetic belt fall within reasonable limits of the Himalayas. So repercussions are bound to be felt there," she observed. \n M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said 31 new earthquake observatories will come up in the country by March next year. At present, there are 84 observatories. \n This is being done to detect and record earthquake parameters more accurately and identify possible precursors of tremors. \n The NCS has also carried out microzonation of cities like Delhi and Kolkata to study the possible impact of earthquake in these mega cities.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'Donald Trump talks on law enforcement at Suffolk Community College in New York (AFP)\n During a speech on Long Island on Friday, President Donald Trump took a break from discussing gang violence and illegal immigration to give the law enforcement officers gathered for his remarks some advice on how to treat suspects.\n"When you guys put somebody in the car and you\'re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?" Trump said, miming the physical motion of an officer shielding a suspect\'s head to keep it from bumping against the squad car.\n "Like, don\'t hit their head, and they just killed somebody - don\'t hit their head," Trump continued. "I said, you can take the hand away, OK?"\n These remarks, coming after Trump talked about towns ravaged by gang violence and described "these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon," met with applause from at least some of the law enforcement officers gathered for his speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York.\n A group of uniform officers standing behind Trump applauded, and, when he turned to face them, some smiled and appeared to chuckle.\n In response to a question regarding Trump\'s comments and the officers who applauded, the Suffolk County police quickly distanced the department from Trump\'s comments, saying Friday that they would not accept this treatment of people in custody. \n "The Suffolk County Police Department has strict rules and procedures relating to the handling of prisoners, and violations of those rules and procedures are treated extremely seriously," the department said in an emailed statement. "As a department, we do not and will not tolerate \'rough[ing]\' up prisoners."\n Trump\'s remarks also drew a rebuke from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a statement, the group did not specifically mention Trump by name but appeared to respond to his speech by stressing the importance of treating all people, including suspects, with respect.\n "Managing use of force is one of the most difficult challenges faced by law enforcement agencies," the group said. "The ability of law enforcement officers to enforce the law, protect the public, and guard their own safety, the safety of innocent bystanders, and even those suspected or apprehended for criminal activity is very challenging.\n "For these reasons, law enforcement agencies develop policies and procedures, as well as conduct extensive training, to ensure that any use of force is carefully applied and objectively reasonable considering the situation confronted by the officers," the statement continued.\n Trump\'s comments were made during a dark, foreboding address largely focusing on the transnational gang MS-13. He also peppered his speech with expressions of support for police, echoing his efforts both during and since the presidential campaign to portray himself as a champion of law enforcement.\n These remarks were condemned by civil rights and advocacy groups. Vanita Gupta, who ran the Justice Department\'s civil rights division during the Obama administration, decried the comments and said they ran counter to efforts from local police agencies to repair relationships with their communities.\n "Trump\'s remarks today are unconscionable," Gupta, who is now president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. "The President of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence. His remarks undermine the positive efforts of local law enforcement agencies and communities around the country working to address police misconduct and build community-police trust."\n Janai Nelson, the associate director-counsel NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Trump\'s comments "encouraging police officers to disregard the safety of individuals in their custody rises to a new level of danger."\n "We need law enforcement who do not share the Trump Administration\'s outdated and unlawful views to promote protecting the rights and safety of all Americans by condemning those who condone impunity among law enforcement," Nelson said in a statement.\n The American Civil Liberties Union posted on Twitter that Trump was "urging lawlessness" with his speech.\n Trump has previously encouraged violent behavior during public remarks, particularly during his raucous presidential campaign rallies. At a November 2015 rally in Alabama, Trump said that a protester was loud and "maybe he should have been roughed up."\n During another campaign rally in Michigan, Trump said he would defend in court anyone who hurt a protester being escorted out. When a protester interrupted a Las Vegas rally, Trump said "guys like that" used to be "carried out in a stretcher," adding: "I\'d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya." At another rally, Trump said protesters were being removed too slowly because "nobody wants to hurt each other anymore."\n With his comments Friday, Trump appeared to encourage police officers not to worry about using excessive force during arrests.\n Officers can be arrested and charged with excessive force, facing charges on both a local and federal level. Several Suffolk County police officers were indicted last year and accused of beating a suspect after he was arrested in 2012. In November, a week before Trump was elected, the former Suffolk County police chief was sentenced to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to a federal civil rights violation and conspiring to obstruct justice; authorities said he beat a man handcuffed and in police custody.\n The Justice Department said its investigations of unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement officers most frequently involve allegations of excessive force. If a person alleging excessive force has been arrested or detained, federal officials must prove that an officer used more force "than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim," the Justice Department states.\n In 2016, a former Las Vegas police officer was charged with violating the civil rights of an unnamed person by using excessive force during an arrest; the indictment specifically notes that among other things, the officer slammed the person\'s head into the door of his police car.\n Such charges have continued during the Trump administration. Last month, the Justice Department announced that three current and former Florida police officers had been indicted in connection with the assault of a car passenger during a traffic stop. Officers charged with using excessive force during arrests have also faced charges of making false statements about what unfolded.\n Excessive force lawsuits can also be costly for local governments. Last month, a $225,000 settlement was reached in the case of a Pennsylvania man who said he was shocked with a Taser after arguing with an officer during his arrest. In 2015, a $1 million settlement was reached in a case involving a California sheriff\'s deputy accused of using excessive force on a man with Down syndrome.\n Trump and his administration have offered a defense of law enforcement officers in the face of what they have portrayed as an anti-police mentality. Attorney General Jeff Sessions tied a recent increase in violent crime to "undermined" respect for police.\n Sessions\'s Justice Department has also launched a review of all police-reform agreements in place nationwide, pacts that remain a key legacy of former president Barack Obama\'s administration. Such agreements are typically reached after expansive federal civil rights investigations, such as the probe of the Chicago police, released days before Trump took office, which determined that officers there routinely use excessive force and violate the rights of residents.\n Before he was confirmed, Sessions said that consent decrees forcing reforms on departments can "undermine the respect for police officers." In April, the Justice Department said that officials would review all existing agreements to ensure they do not work against the Trump administration\'s goals of fighting violent crime while protecting officer safety and morale. Police departments have vowed to continue pushing for reforms.\n During his speech Friday, Trump also returned to a familiar theme for him: invoking, and questioning, the levels of violence in Chicago. Speaking in New York, Trump appeared to tell a variation on a story he shared last year about an unnamed "top police officer" in the city who could stop the bloodshed there in a matter of days.\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n'

S'Reported by :\nReliance Jio has created yet another disruption in the Indian telecom market with its new tariff plans. A few weeks back, the new entrant rolled out new tariff plans of Rs. 349 and Rs. 399. The Rs. 399 plan offers same benefits as the Rs. 309 plan of 1GB data per day and unlimited voice calls, SMS.\nTo counter this plan, incumbent operators such as Vodafone, Idea Cellular, and Bharti Airtel has rolled out attractive tariff plans to retain its customers. Here are the five tariff plans unveiled by the top three telecom operators in recent times.\nAirtel Rs. 799 Plan\nTo counter Jio, Airtel has brought a new high volume of Rs. 799 data pack for prepaid users. Airtel is now offering a prepaid plan of Rs. 799 focussed for high volume data users. The Rs. 799 plan offers 3GB per day of 2G/3G/4G data and unlimited local and STD calls to any network. The validity of the pack is 28 days. This plan is valid only for 29 days unlike the Jio\xe2\x80\x99s plan; nevertheless, it offers 3GB data per day.\nVodafone Rs. 244 Plan\nThe all new Rs. 244 plan from Vodafone gives 1GB 3G/4G data per day, and unlimited Vodafone to Vodafone calls for 70 days. This plan is applicable for all Vodafone users, however, the price of the plan differs with the circle.\nIdea Cellular Rs. 357, Rs. 697, Rs. 897, and Rs. 1197\nIdea Cellular unveiled four new plans for Himachal Pradesh users recently. Starting with the Rs. 357 plan, it gives 1GB data per day for 28 days; the Rs. 697 plan offers 1.5GB data per day for 84 days, while the Rs. 897 plan offers 2GB data per day for 84 days. Lastly, the Rs. 1197 plan provides 2.5GB data per day for 84 days. All these plans offer unlimited voice calls to any network.\nVodafone Rs. 346 Plan\nThe Rs. 346 plan from Vodafone offers 1GB data per day, and unlimited voice calls to any network for 56 days. However, the voice calls are limited to 300 minutes per day, and 1200 minutes per week. Vodafone is offering 56GB data with this plan. Previously, these benefits were offered under the Rs. 356 plan. This plan is valid for existing users as well.\nAirtel Rs. 399 Plan\nBharti Airtel has come up with a new plan of Rs. 399 a few weeks ago. It offers 1GB data per day, and unlimited voice calls to any network with a data cap of 300 minutes per day and 1200 minutes per week. However, this plan is applicable only for 4G handset users.\nNote: Some of these plans are user specific. So, please check with your operator before proceeding for recharge.\n  Story first published on: July 29, 2017 at 10:09 am  \n'

S'A rare total solar eclipse will happen in the United States on August 21st, 2017. It will be a spectacle to see and the word is getting out to the public. Inevitably with science, misconceptions and inaccurate statements are emerging on social media. As a climate scientist, I am used to the public shaping its own understanding of science based on personal experiences or interpretations. People believe that deserts do not get cold or that climate change is not real because it snows in the winter, but I digress. It is important for scientists to help increase science literacy using \xe2\x80\x9cteachable moments.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought that it would be useful to clear up some of the emerging misconceptions about the Great American Eclipse that I noticed on my own social media pages. I suspect that they represent a sample of thoughts by others.\nPath of totality and what you will see.\nIf you are not in the path of totality you will not experience anything. I recently pondered on social media about what local school systems in North Georgia and the Atlanta area would do with the students since peak darkness will be around 2:30 or so. This is the time that many schools in our area dismiss students. Given that most of the diagrams that I have seen in media outlets and websites show the path of 100% totality (as below), it is natural that some people might interpret that as meaning something is only going to happen in path of totality. I prefer the graphic shown above because it conveys much more information on what someone is likely to see given their position. I am a professor at the University of Georgia and we are hosting a massive viewing party in iconic Sanford Stadium. This map shows what we can expect in a region of 99.1% totality in Athens, Georgia. It should be noted that I captured a snapshot in time near Georgia, but I strongly recommend the full animation at this website developed by former colleagues of mine at NASA. As pointed out by colleagues at Great American Eclipse, viewing the full animation will prevent any misinterpretation of the snapshot image.\nPath of U.S. eclipse.\nWe have seen eclipses before recently, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? Another common interpretation is that we have eclipses like this fairly regularly so why are scientists and the media making such a big deal about this one. According to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s website describing the August event\na total eclipse will cross the entire country, coast-to-coast, for the first time since 1918\nFor the United States, the total eclipse will begin in Lincoln City, Oregon and end somewhere around Charleston, South Carolina. Many have told me that they remember an eclipse happening a few years ago or when they were in school. Perhaps, they did but it was different from what we are about to experience. The NASA diagrams below show the types of eclipses that the United States and other parts of the world have experienced over the period 1981 to 2000 and 2000 to 2020, respectively. As you can see, there has been no total eclipse in the United States during that time period except the upcoming event. The year 1979 was the last time a total solar eclipse was visible from any part of the contiguous United States, but the path of totality could really only be viewed from Canada and northwestern states. In 1991, parts of Hawaii were near the path of totality of a total eclipse as well. If you click this link, it is an excellent resource for identifying when the next total eclipse path may be near you.\nEclipses (1981 to 2000)\nEclipses (2000 to 2020)\nThere are different types of solar eclipses. NASA is obviously an excellent source for information on how they differ. According to the website\nA total solar eclipse is only visible from a small area on Earth. The people who see the total eclipse are in the center of the moon\xe2\x80\x99s shadow when it hits Earth. The sky becomes very dark, as if it were night. For a total eclipse to take place, the sun, moon, and Earth must be in a direct line\xe2\x80\xa6.The second type of solar eclipse is a partial solar eclipse. This happens when the sun, moon, and Earth are not exactly lined up. The sun appears to have a dark shadow on only a small part of its surface\xe2\x80\xa6.The third type is an annular (ANN you ler) solar eclipse. An annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from Earth. Because the moon is farther away from Earth, it seems smaller. It does not block the entire view of the sun. The moon in front of the sun looks like a dark disk on top of a larger sun-colored disk. This creates what looks like a ring around the moon.\nIf it is cloudy or raining, we will not experience anything. Many people will be traveling to the path of totality hoping for that once in a lifetime experience. Hotels are overbooked along the path, and I am sure the astute observer has considered the possibility of clouds. In a previous Forbes piece, I shared a useful tool for determining the probability of cloud cover where you may be. However, if it is overcast or cloudy near the path of totality, observers are still going to experience \xe2\x80\x9csomething.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the eclipse2017.org website states\nIf the sky is completely overcast, it will get VERY dark \xe2\x80\x93 pitch black, in fact, to the point where it will be tricky to walk around\xe2\x80\xa6If there are broken or scattered clouds, then you will have to hope that the Sun is not behind one of them at the time of totality\xe2\x80\xa6..If the Sun is behind a cloud during totality, you will still experience the temperature drop, and the sunset glow on the horizon \xe2\x80\x93 but this is not how you want to see a total eclipse!\nEven if it is cloudy and you are near the eclipse path, something odd and cool will happen during the middle of the day.\nOh, cool, we can make our own viewing glasses. One of the most important messages to convey is not to look directly at the eclipse with your naked eyes. You should only use sanctioned or certified eclipse-viewing glasses or some other type of solar viewer. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s website is very clear\nThe only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as \xe2\x80\x9ceclipse glasses\xe2\x80\x9d (example shown at left) or hand-held solar viewers. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, are not safe for looking at the sun\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Do not look at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars, or another optical device. Similarly, do not look at the sun through a camera, a telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while using your eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewer \xe2\x80\x94 the concentrated solar rays will damage the filter and enter your eye(s), causing serious injury.\nThere are various indirect alternatives like the Pinhole Camera or Viewer described here.\nEnjoy the eclipse safely.\nUpdated at 5:13 pm\n'

S'(Eds: Recasting overnight story) \nNew Delhi, Jul 29 (PTI)\n A 10-year-old rape survivor has lost her legal battle with the Supreme Court refusing to allow termination of her 32-week-old pregnancy, relying on a medical report that it would not be good for her or the foetus. \nA bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud yesterday also asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar to convey its suggestion to the Centre that a permanent medical board be set up in each state to take prompt decisions in cases where women and girls seek nod for abortion.\nThe bench perused the report of the medical board set up by the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI), Chandigarh to examine the child and the consequences if the termination of pregnancy was allowed.\n"In view of the recommendations made in by the medical board in its report, it would neither be in the interest of the girl child nor the alive foetus, which is approximately 32-weeks-old, to order abortion," it said.\nThe court expressed satisfaction on the care being provided to the girl at a government hospital in Chandigarh and said that it was a "fully equipped" to provide the best medical help.\nThe court, while disposing of the plea, rapped the counsel for the petitioner for approaching the apex court directly without availing the remedy at the high court level.\n"The matter was before the district court and you should have gone to the high court, but you directly came to the Supreme Court," the bench said, adding as the girl was running against the time, it did not pass any order on this issue.\nThe court then asked the solicitor general, present in the courtroom, to ask the Centre to consider asking states to set up a permanent medical board to take up such cases.\nIt said that such matters were coming more to the Supreme Court and precious time was being lost in setting up of a medical board for examination.\nThe solicitor general said that he would convey the court\'s suggestion to the Centre and get back to it.\nThe apex court had on July 24 issued notice to the Centre on the plea seeking its nod for the abortion and had ordered the child\'s examination by a medical board consented to by one of her parents.\nThe PIL was filed after a Chandigarh district court on July 18 refused to let the girl undergo the abortion after it was confirmed that she was almost 28 weeks pregnant.\nCourts allow medical termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act and can make an exception if the foetus is genetically abnormal.\n'

S' With the appetite for dining out taking a downward course as people increasingly choose to abstain from traffic and eat in the comfort of their homes, food-tech startups that cater to delivering this experience for them have been mushrooming over the years. This is corroborated in the overall investments in food-tech in 2016 which displayed a partial uptick from the previous year. \n However, even as investments have heated up, losses by these companies have also mounted by leaps and bounds as they fish around for a sustainable business model. It is in this scenario that a bunch of them are seen experimenting with a recipe that intents to not just leave their customers satiated, but also set their cash registers ringing. \n Labelled \'cloud kitchens\', some of the leading players in this space are waking up to this concept, tested and validated by FreshMenu back in 2014 when it first started off. \n "Unlike most food-tech companies that are fundamentally delivery-only platforms for existing network of restaurants, we additionally cook our own food, giving us end-to-end control over its quality, thereby improving customer experience," says founder, Rashmi Daga. "This also helps us manage orders better and trim costs," she adds. \n A kitchen-centric model that takes over the reins of preparation, packaging and delivery of food without providing any dine-in facility to end-consumers, it has been feeding the curiosity of startups that are looking to replace traditional business models with a more sustainable and scalable one. \nKa-ching! \n Although such an undertaking requires a lot of dough at the outset - starting from infrastructure costs to procuring ingredients and hiring quality chefs - Daga firmly believes that aggregation is not their cup of tea since there is no money to be made there. \n "Having control over supply will help reach profitability faster since you get a better cut of the overall order," she says. "Aggregators receive just a fraction of that - the rest is pocketed by restaurants and third party logistics, if delivery also is outsourced to external players," she added. \n Agrees co-founder and CEO of Foodpanda India, Saurabh Kochhar: "The more parts of the process that you own, the more control you have and the possibilities here are endless," he admits, but is quick to add that delivery by itself also offers room for innovation and experimentation. "Our core business will continue to be in food ordering and delivery and we will not be going into the kitchen side of things as of now," he says. \n Another aspect that gives cloud kitchens more flavour is the growing consumer proclivity to eat healthy food as against the greasy fare that fast-food establishments generally listed with these aggregators offer. \n "There may be hundreds of restaurants today for people to choose from, but those that offer good quality nutritious food are still in the minority," feels Daga. "At FreshMenu, we understand consumers\' needs and work with them to cull out different menus which are healthy without compromising on taste," she adds. \n Moreover, costs of maintaining a full-fledged restaurant - not to mention sky-high real estate prices at pricey locations - far outstrip the expenses of running kitchen-only units. \nFood chain \n Up until now, most food-tech startups essentially provided a marketplace for restaurants to fuel their delivery sales, but this is beginning to change with established players like Swiggy and Zomato getting on the cloud kitchen bandwagon. \n Although this new model still involves partnership with restaurants listed on the aggregators\' platforms, it does give them better bargaining power and a bigger piece of the overall order value. \n Swiggy has been collaborating with popular restaurants in Bangalore to offer them access to localities where they do not have a physical presence, but may have potential customers. It dished out The Bowl Company on a pint-sized scale late last year whereby it has been teaming up with multiple brands that work out of a single kitchen, thus offering a well-curated menu to its users. \n Zomato - another votary of the model - also launched its rendition of a cloud kitchen in Delhi-NCR about three months ago, and like Swiggy, instead of taking ownership of the cooking process, is collaborating with partner restaurants to prepare the food. \n "We do not want to compete with our own clients," founder Deepinder Goyal had said in a company blogpost. "Through our cloud kitchen model, we will offer them kitchen infrastructure (and delivery) services and charge them a nominal percentage of their revenue," he had said. \nZomato Infrastructure Services - or ZIS - will build the kitchen and supply all equipments for partner restaurants to \'walk in and start their business in a matter of hours.\' Like the model followed by other players, this will also not have dine-in (or take-out) facilities and will only deliver food to customers. \n According to Goyal, the real opportunity for ZIS lies in second tier cities - that is, beyond the top metros where these restaurants already have a strong presence. "This can potentially give a huge boost to our online food ordering business," he says in the blog. "Business does not have to be a win-lose situation. Our ZIS team will act as a key partner for restaurants to make their business successful, and in the process, our business successful," he further adds. \n In theory, four or more restaurants will be co-located with each other and each will get roughly 300 sq ft to cook out of, leading to shared - and thus lower - costs. This strategy to support the presence of partner restaurants across the country to increase revenue generation is also closely followed by Mumbai-based Scootsy as it looks to scale going forward. \n "Going ahead, we will be opening pop-up kitchens across the country for restaurants that do not exist in that particular city," says CEO, Sandeep Das. "These restaurants will be rotated depending on their popularity. But at any given time, there will be four or five brands working together and we will prepare and deliver on their behalf," he adds. \nBland truth \n Despite the palatable nature of the model, as in the traditional business of food-tech, irregular pattern of delivery during lean hours of the day and high operational costs remain key challenges, even as it offers these companies a path to scale. \n "FreshMenu has been able to show both economics and scale and that is the attraction to getting into cloud kitchen," says Daga. "Our cost of delivery for each order has come down from Rs 100 in the first year of operation to half that amount today because of efficiencies of scale. And since we have been able to bundle delivery with food creation, we are able to create a better customer experience and retention rates. It is not easy, but if it takes off, it can be rewarding," she admits. \n Concurs Zomato\'s Goyal: "Like any other business, this also carries execution risks. But once we learn the business model\'s nuances, we will expand it further," he states in the blogpost. "As we scale this business, our costs of operation should come down further and increase our return on capital," he adds. \nTall order? \n According to a report by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation - a trust set up by the commerce ministry - India\'s food delivery market alone is worth $15 billion today. \n "India is a very large market and customers have different taste preferences which no brand can cater to single-handedly," says FreshMenu\'s Daga. "So it is a space where multiple companies will co-exist. And with time, as more and more people get online, the opportunity - as well as the challenges - will grow manifold" she adds. \n "By bringing convenience, choice, reliability and a great experience of food-ordering, Swiggy has become a loved consumer brand," says Srivats TS, VP Marketing at the company. In fact, Swiggy claims that it gets 5-6 repeat orders per customer per month - twice as much as any other competitor in the space today. \n "In fact, our top customers have ordered as often as 30 times a month," says Srivats. "India as a market holds tremendous potential for food-tech and as more players enter this space, it will bring opportunities and innovation that benefit the entire ecosystem," he adds. \n  Goyal mirrors his optimism as he hopes that shared resources through the latest model will improve efficiencies and help keep unit economics positive. "Our initial estimates tell us that with some hard work, we can have 100 locations by the end of 2018," he adds. \n'

S'Sri Lanka\'s cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha denies excluding Graham Ford from meetings while the latter was the team coach AFP/Getty Images\nGraham Ford had disagreed with the appointment of Asanka Gurusinha as Sri Lanka\'s cricket manager "from the start", but there was no effort to exclude Ford from team matters, and no undue interference in Ford\'s role by the board, Gurusinha has said in an interview with ESPNcricinfo. Gurusinha also said his newly formed role does not unduly overlap with that of a head coach.\nFord resigned in June, following what he felt were intrusions into what ought to have been his sphere of influence. Ford met with board officials in Colombo upon his return from the Champions Trophy. Having been told on that occasion that he would have to report to Gurusinha, he then declined to continue.\n"Graham, from the start, probably didn\'t agree with my role," Gurusinha said. "He thought I was interfering a lot more. I thought I wasn\'t. We did discuss it a lot. I am not sure what he discussed with the SLC president or anything like that. My role was always as a team manager and I will give certain ideas."\nThere are reports of several instances where Gurusinha and Ford differed during the Champions Trophy, including in the area of selection. As part of his duties as cricket manager, Gurusinha is also the selector on tour. But that is a power that he does not wield with unwarranted force, said Gurusinha.\n"At the end of the day, I do make the decision on the team - on the final XI. That decision is mine. But in my five months, I\'ve never gone against the captain\'s decision. With the head coach - I wouldn\'t say I always agree with everything. But I look at the fact that the captain goes to the middle with the team, not me. I have always given the team that the captain wanted. During the Champions Trophy, the final XI, even on things that I didn\'t agree, I always went with Angelo Mathews\' final decision. He has to go to the middle."\nAllegations have also arisen that Ford was systematically pushed out by Gurusinha, who is claimed to have excluded Ford from team meetings, making Ford feel redundant. Gurusinha denied this.\n"There was nothing like that happening. We didn\'t have a single meeting without Graham Ford, if it was cricket-related. If it was administration- or security-related, we won\'t get Ford into those meetings. But anything with cricket or cricket selection, Graham was always there. Even though Graham is not a selector in SLC\'s selection policy, I always had him there. We always had the vice-captain there as well. It was a team that discussed everything, and I never excluded Graham."\nGurusinha described his role as one of coordinating with the head coach, the selectors, the high-performance centre, the players, and SLC. As such, he said he could act as a buffer between the coach and SLC\'s administrators, who have a long history of intruding into team matters.\n"It\'s important that you\'re clear with administrators and say: \'This is not part of your position. This is part of mine. Let me do it and trust me. I do respect SLC\'s policies and all of that - absolutely. But when it comes to decision-making, I always do everything within my powers.\n"But I haven\'t come across anything like that [intrusions by administrators]. I also have good relationships with SLC officials. And they do respect me for who I am."\nThe full interview with Asanka Gurusinha will be published on July 29\n'

S'The turbulent history of HIV/AIDS\nParis (CNN)The evidence is in and the message is clear: When someone is HIV positive, taking regular treatment can pretty much zero their chance of spreading the infection to others during sex.\nSexual transmission of HIV is negligible when someone is on treatment, whether they\'re in a heterosexual or homosexual relationship, according to results from previous studies and now a large-scale study of homosexual men, presented at the ninth International AIDS Conference on HIV Science in Paris on Tuesday.\nHIV experts emphasized this aspect of prevention, highlighting the "Undetectable equals Untransmissible" campaign, during a press conference at the international meeting. The campaign works to encourage people worldwide to stay on treatment by ensuring they understand that doing so could mean they cannot infect others.\nThis message is not aligned with the status quo in terms of the care people infected with HIV receive today, believes Bruce Richman, founder and executive director of Prevention Access Campaign and the "Undetectable = Untransmittable" initiative. "This is transmission-stopping information," he said.\nNew vaccine results have shown promise at the meeting this week and in recent studies, but are still far from becoming a reality to end the epidemic.\nOverwhelming evidence\nIn the largest-ever trial on HIV transmission risk among homosexual men, Australian researchers explored the sex lives and HIV rates of more than 350 homosexual couples where one person is HIV positive. The couples were from Brazil, Thailand and Australia.\nEach couple reported their sexual activity when visiting clinics involved in the trial and HIV-negative partners were regularly tested to diagnose any new infections.\nThe couples participating reported having sex almost 17,000 times without condoms between them over four years, and none of those times resulted in new infections.\n"There was not a single linked HIV infection in these couples," said Andrew Grulich, professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the study. "Nobody became infected from their partner."\nThree new infections were discovered during the trial, but analysis of the virus showed they had come from sex outside of the relationships, not from the person on treatment within the couple.\nSex without a condom is not necessarily advised, however, to prevent risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). "This (group) had very high STIs," Grulich told CNN, adding that 20% of the men in the trial developed STIs each year, yet there were zero HIV infections. \nApproximately 10% of men had STIs associated with anal sex, which experts had previously thought aided HIV transmission, Gulich said.\nThe new evidence builds on previous studies on couples where one partner is HIV positive and on treatment, including a landmark study in 2011 that found that treatment can prevent new infections among couples by 96% and a second study in Europe in 2016 showing no transmission at all.\nTreatment as prevention is now recommended by the World Health Organization as a key component to include in HIV prevention programs,\nThe latest trial is the first to explore the benefits of treatment as prevention across multiple continents, showing this approach could be universally applicable. "We wanted to see if this could be applied in different settings where there are also HIV epidemics among homosexual men," said Grulich.\nAn estimated 68% of new HIV infections in Australia in 2015 were among homosexual men, according to the Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations.\nThe preventative effects are particularly strong due to the increased risk of transmission that comes with anal sex.\nProtective, despite greater risk\n"We know transmission risk by anal sex is approximately 10 times higher than risk by vaginal sex," said Grulich, who feared this could lead to some infections during the trial. "This provides reassuring evidence that treatment is as effective in homosexual men," he said.\n"This (study) is confirmation of something we have known for some time," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, within the US National Institutes of Health. \nThe fact that transmission risk is clearly greater by anal intercourse shows this is a powerful tool for prevention, he said. "Now is the time to push for it."\nInternational AIDS Society President Linda-Gail Bekker believes working to ensure more people get tested for HIV and therefore treated is a crucial component of the current fight against the virus, but not necessarily the immediate one.\n"Let\'s have a reductionist approach, but I think there is also lag in terms of treatment as prevention. You\'ve got to get things up to scale," she told CNN. In the meantime, she said, the services we already have for people who are uninfected to protect themselves should be pushed.\nThese currently available services include high-risk groups taking drugs to prevent infection, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medical male circumcision, which can reduce transmission from women to men by 60%, and condom use. "That will curb the transmission rate more quickly" while we begin treatment as prevention and wait for it to become more widely available globally, she said.\nBekker used the example of Swaziland, where rates of HIV were reported on Monday to have dramatically declined since 2011, according to the US President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Swaziland has the highest prevalence of HIV in the world, but new infections have almost halved since 2011, after providing treatment and male circumcision for more than 12 million people.\nBy the time these prevention options are extensively promoted and provided to those who need them, Bekker hopes a vaccine may then finally ready. This would truly eliminate the disease, rather than control it, she believes.\nNew vaccine promise\nResults from a recent vaccine trial, known as the APPROACH trial, were presented at the conference Monday and revealed this type of vaccine could instigate an immune response against HIV when tested on almost 400 volunteers across five countries.\nThe type used were mosaic vaccines, where components of different HIV viruses are combined together to create an immune response in the body.\nSeven different regimens of the vaccine were tested and all elicited an immune response and were well tolerated in the body. One that previously showed promise in animals shined through, giving the strongest response in humans.\nThe researchers stress, however, that simply because an immune response was created does not mean it will prevent someone becoming infected with HIV.\n"The promising, early-stage results from the APPROACH study support further evaluation of these candidate vaccines to assess their ability to protect those at risk of acquiring HIV," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a principal investigator for APPROACH, in a statement.\nJoin the conversation\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n"A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic," said Fauci, whose institute supported the trial. "By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals." \nBekker added that this is one of three avenues currently being explored to create an effective vaccine against HIV, including one being trialed in her home country, South Africa. Whichever one wins the race, it can\'t come fast enough.\n"Finally, a vaccine will clean (HIV infections) up" after these prevention services are in place, she said. "And hopefully eliminate HIV."\n'

S'Organisations in the city conducted various awareness programmes in the city on the occasion of International Tiger Day on Saturday. Indira Gandhi Zoological Park in association with Paryavarna Margadarsi Vaisakhi celebrated the day at the zoo with a rally, a talk on tiger conservation and a film at the zoo Bioscope. \nStudents of A.S. Raja Junior College, Bharathi Vidyanikethan School and Trinity Public School participated in the awareness programme. \nTiger being an umbrella species, its presence indicates the health of terrestrial ecosystem and declining tiger habitats indicates the depletion of life supporting systems for all living beings including humans, zoo curator B. Vijaya Kumar said. \nExperts stressed that focus should be more on the grass land management by the foresters so as to maintain the prey base for predators to prosper besides stringent action on poaching of wild animals and separate wings in forest department for intelligence gathering. \nTrendsetters Charitable Trust in association with AP Forest Department conducted an awareness programme on tiger conservation at Kambalakonda Eco Tourism Park.The event was kicked off with a briefing by wildlife conservationist Santosh Edupuganti on the importance of tigers in ecosystem, how tiger census is conducted and importance of wildlife conservation. \nLater, participants were shown how camera traps were helpful in monitoring wildlife. Participants were explained about various tiger census techniques like pug mark criteria, camera trap criteria and tiger unique stripe identification methods. \nA trek was organised in the park wherein the participants saw some rare and uncommon birds like orange breasted green pigeon and flowerpecker. Zoo curator B. Vijaya Kumar distributed tiger posters and explained importance of tiger and conservation and challenges in conserving wildlife \n'

Reuters\nThe Revenue and Disaster Management Department alerted the District Collectors of Keonjhar, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Balasore, Mayurbhanj and Sundargarh "in view of the Indian meteorological department forecast of extremely heavy rainfall in the next 48 hours", which may trigger floods in the Baitarani, Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga and Brahmani rivers.\nAccording to meteorological department, heavy to very heavy rainfall is also expected in few places of other districts like Bhadrak, Angul, Deogarh, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Dhenkanal, Bargarh and Sonepur.\nThe district collectors have been asked to remain in full preparedness to face any eventuality and ensure that field officials are in their respective position, said an official of Special Relief Commissioner\'s office.\nMany parts of Odisha are likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall under the influence of upper air cyclonic circulation over Gangetic West Bengal. Under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to develop during next 24 hours, the meteorological department said.\nFishermen have been advised to be cautious while venturing into the sea along and off the Odisha coast as sea condition is likely to prevail moderate to rough due to Southwesterly wind flow with speed reaching 40-45 kmph gusting 55 kmph along and off Odisha coast, said the meteorological department.\nMeanwhile, first flood waters of this season were released from Hirakud Dam in Mahanadi on Sunday. Sluice gates of the dam were opened to keep the water level in check.\n'

S'.\nPeople who are diagnosed with coronary artery disease and then develop depression face a risk of death that\xe2\x80\x99s twice as high as heart patients without depression, according to a major new study by researchers at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City. \nThe increased risk of death from any cause holds true whether the depression immediately follows the heart disease diagnosis or occurs even years later, according to Heidi May, PhD, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute and the study\xe2\x80\x99s lead author. She said the findings point out the importance of screening for and treating depression even years after someone is diagnosed with heart disease.\nThe research, one of a number of studies to explore the connection between heart disease and development of depression by researchers at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, will be published on July 28th in the European Heart Journal \xe2\x80\x93 Quality of Care & Clinical Outcomes, one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious peer-reviewed cardiovascular disease journal. Researchers found that post-coronary artery disease depression was the single biggest predictor of death and remained so even after researchers controlled for the other factors.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how long or how short it was, patients were found to have twice the risk of dying compared to those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a follow-up diagnosis of depression,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. May said. \xe2\x80\x9cDepression was the strongest risk factor for dying, compared to any other risk factors we evaluated. That included age, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, or having a heart attack or stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat association didn\xe2\x80\x99t change for patients who were previously diagnosed with depression before their heart disease diagnosis or for patients whose angiograms were performed for various reasons, which included stable angina, unstable angina, or heart attack.\nDr. May and the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute research team studied 24,138 patients who underwent angiographies, which determined they had coronary artery disease. To detect subsequent depression, the researchers looked at standardized diagnostic codes called International Classification of Diseases codes, or ICD codes.\nPatients with depression were also placed into subcategories based on how long after their heart disease diagnosis the depression was identified. Dr. May said most studies have looked at depression at a single point in time, such as within 30 days of a heart event or at the time of heart disease diagnosis.\n Stay updated on the go with The Hans India News App. Click for Android / IOS download it for your device. \n'

S'Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said.\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before," he said. This time, however, he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\nAnother Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined \nby experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n"They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". \nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. \n'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): On Global Tiger Day, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is urging tiger-range governments to strengthen anti-poaching efforts and crack down on a severe wildlife snaring crisis that is threatening wildlife across Asia, especially the world\'s remaining wild tigers, which number only around 3,900.\nIn India, reported tiger deaths related to poaching reached an all time high in 2016. These reported figures might represent only a fraction of actual mortality. Electrocution and poisoning of the big cats have also been recorded across tiger habitats.\nWith wildlife traps and electric wires embedded deep into the ground or hid among debris, the detection of these devices are often difficult and missed by forest guards who manually patrol our forests to ensure protection of our wildlife.\nEasy to make from widely available material such as bicycle cable wires and quick to set up, wire snares are deadly traps that are fast becoming the plague of Asia\'s forests.\nDriven by the growing illegal wildlife trade, which is now reaching an estimated USD 20 billion annually illegal wildlife trade is estimated to reach USD20 billion per year, which makes wildlife trafficking the world\'s fourth largest illicit trade, after narcotics, human trafficking and trade in counterfeit goods.\n"Snares are dangerous, insidious and quickly becoming a major contributor to the wave of extinction that is spreading throughout Southeast Asia - and tigers are being swept up in this crisis. All efforts to recover wild tigers are now imperiled by snaring on a massive scale. We cannot over emphasize the need for strong government commitment and investment in rangers who are on the frontline of conservation, clearing snares and apprehending those who set them," said Mike Baltzer, leader of WWF Tigers Alive.\nIn the rare occasion that a wild tiger is able to escape a snare, it suffers debilitating injuries that prevent it from hunting, eventually causing it to die of starvation or infection.\nIn addition, snares maim or kill any animal that activates them thus dealing a double blow to wild tigers, by trapping the prey base they need to survive and reproduce.\n"It\'s impossible to know how many snares are being set up every day, and threatening wildlife in these critical habitats. Hundreds of thousands of deadly snares are removed by rangers from Asia\'s protected areas annually, but this is just the tip of the iceberg," said Rohit Singh, wildlife law enforcement expert at WWF.\nWithin the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the only place on Earth where wild tigers, orangutans, elephants and rhinos are found in the same habitat, snare traps are estimated to have doubled between 2006 and 2014. The number of snare traps in Sumatra recorded in 2013 and 2014 are doubled, when compared to the preceding eight years, suggesting a higher number of poachers in the area.\nYet, many of such critical habitats lack adequate resources for protection. In nearby Rimbang Baling, one of several protected areas in Sumatra, only 26 rangers patrol over 1,400 square kilometres, an area equivalent to nearly twice the size of New York City.\nTRAFFIC India introduced Deep Search Metal Detectors (DSMD) in 2008 which have been distributed to Tiger Reserves across the country. The DSMDs help in detecting traps/snares, wires and other metal devices even buried up-to seven feet below the ground or debris.\nLocal communities also play an integral role in the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. In India approximately 45 million people live in forest-fringe areas and more than 300 million people are dependent on forests for subsistence and cash livelihoods.\nEngagement of local communities is thus a key constituent in conservation efforts and can lead the way in helping reduce poaching and managing human-tiger interactions in the country.\nSpeaking about the importance of community involvement to reduce poaching, Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, "WWF-India has been working with communities on holistic approaches to conservation. Making them primary stakeholders in the protection of forests and its wildlife can go a long way in enhancing anti-poaching efforts of the country."\nIn 2010, tiger range governments committed to the most ambitious conservation goal set for a single species - TX2, or the global goal to double wild tigers by 2022. Since 2016, the long trend of decline in global wild tiger numbers has halted for now and may even begin to rise, signaling a beacon of hope for global tiger conservation.\nConservation organisations across the continent are calling for urgent action to build awareness and strengthen anti-poaching measures and reinforce investments in rangers, without which the poaching crisis will turn the trend back towards decline.

S'Parent company Alphabet has yet to lodge an appeal against the EU\'s penalty.\nGerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images\nGoogle\'s parent company Alphabet has\xe2\x80\x94with relative ease\xe2\x80\x94gulped down the record \xe2\x82\xac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) fine slapped on the ad giant by the antitrust wing of the European Commission in June, following a long-running probe of the Google\'s abuse of dominance in Europe\'s search market.\nOn Monday, Alphabet reported second quarter net income of $3.52 billion\xe2\x80\x94down 28 percent from the same period a year ago\xe2\x80\x94due to what it said was "the impact of the $2.7 billion European Commission (EC) fine." Alphabet shares barely wobbled, however, following the Q2 results, which saw sales climb to $26 billion, up 21 percent year-on-year, while earnings per share stood at $5.01.\nGoogle is yet to confirm whether it plans to appeal against the penalty, which Brussels\' competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, meted out to the company after she concluded that it had breached EU rules "by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors."\nArs understands that, prior to Google being lumped with the fine\xe2\x80\x94which it was privately expecting\xe2\x80\x94the ad giant had weakened its rhetoric about appealing against the commission\'s decision. And it\'s still not clear which way Google will jump.\nNotably, the case isn\'t bubble wrapped away from the rest of Google\'s vast online estate. Besides from the "illegal" price comparison conduct, Google faces two preliminary charges of abuse from the commission relating to its Android operating system and AdSense, both of which are still being investigated by Brussels\' competition officials. In its prohibition decision in June, the commission said that each case has "specific characteristics" that need to be examined.\nBut it\'s possible that Google could be attempting to table a remedy offer that addresses all of the cases currently on Vestager\'s desk. Whichever move the company makes next, it is subject to tight time constraints.\nOn the day of the \xe2\x82\xac2.42 billion fine, it was given just 90 days to end its strategy of\xe2\x80\x94as the commission described it\xe2\x80\x94"systematically" applying "prominent placement to its own comparison shopping services" over those of its rivals in that market, such as British vertical search price comparison site Foundem\xe2\x80\x94the firm that first brought its complaint to Brussels in 2009.\nFoundem co-founders Adam and Shivaun Raff.\nThat standoff period expires on September 28, but a threatened fine\xe2\x80\x94on top of the \xe2\x82\xac2.42 billion penalty\xe2\x80\x94of up to 5 percent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet "for each day of non-compliance" won\'t immediately be slapped on Google.\n"If Google doesn\'t comply with its obligations under the decision, it would be subject to a penalty. That would have to be established in a separate commission decision," Vestager\'s office said. Such fines would be "backdated from the date of that decision to when the non-compliance started."\nGoogle didn\'t respond to our request for comment at time of publication. Vestager\'s spokesperson told Ars: "We have nothing new to report" when quizzed on the status of the Android and AdSense investigations.\n'

S" Some time or the other we women have faced problems of dark underarms. It is caused when due to non-exposure of the skin dead cells get accumulated in the underarm area. It can also be due to use of wrongful skincare products and the chemicals that come with it which cause discolouration. \n If you are facing this issue currently, try these natural remedies and you will soon be able to step out wearing your favourite sleeveless top. \n1.  Tomato  juice: Raw tomato too can aid in lightening the dark area in the underarm. Rub a slice of raw tomato daily in the underarms. You can also apply it overnight. \n2. Turmeric: We all know how it is good for the skin due to the presence of chemical curcumin which is also an antioxidant. Mix turmeric powder with lemon juice and apply the paste to the underarm for 15 minutes. Wash away with water. \n3. Lemon juice: With it's antibacterial and antiseptic properties, lemon is a natural bleaching agent which exfoliates the dead cells. Just rub a half cut lemon under the arms for 15 minutes before taking a bath. \n4. Milk: Just take milk or malai and massage it over the darkened underarm area to get a soft and lighter skin tone. \n  5. Oil: Use coconut oil, almond oil or any kind of oil since it acts as a lubricant which can reduce the effect of dry and dark skin under the arms. \n"

S'The more than 200-foot wide and 50-foot deep sinkhole that swallowed homes is far from the state\'s first.\nOn an average day in Land O\'Lakes, Florida, the ground opened up and swallowed a house whole.\nThe house was the latest victim of one of the many sinkholes plaguing Florida. According to Florida news outlet WFLA, two homes, a boat, a driveway, and a portion of the road was sucked into the ground. \nVideo taken at the scene on July 14 shows a home quickly collapsing downward, as if hit from above by an invisible bulldozer. A front exterior wall fell into a gurgling pit of mud, revealing the family\'s living room. While no one was hurt from the incident, the home was destroyed and several others had to be evacuated. \nComparatively, the affected families got off lucky. In 2013, one sinkhole near Tampa opened up in the middle of the night under the bedroom of Jeff Bush, killing him. The same sinkholes reopened again in 2015, though this time no one was hurt. \nLand O\'Lakes is in Pasco Couty, north of Tampa. The new hole is 225 feet wide and 50 feet deep\xe2\x80\x94the largest in the region\'s history. \nA Deadly Phenomenon\n"Sinkholes are probably the least studied hazardous phenomenon on our planet," said Hofstra University geology professor Robert Brinkmann. Brinkmann has been at the forefront of understanding how sinkholes impact urban and suburban areas, so much so that he even wrote a book about it in 2013. \nHe explained that Florida has a landscape uniquely susceptible to sinkholes. The state sits over carbonate rock made of mostly limestone and dolostone. \n(Read about how melting permafrost in Siberia is creating a \'Doorway to Hell.\') \nSinkholes usually form gradually. When finer, sandlike sediment sits over bedrock it can fill the cracks and holes. As the sandier sediment creeps downward, the land sitting atop it subsides. As the void grows, or if top sediment is suddenly washed away by water, sinkholes can form (and are often filled with water). \nOccasionally, underground cavities can form under surface rock. When the cavity expands so much that the surface can no longer support its weight, it suddenly collapses. \nA 2015 survey conducted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection mapped Florida\'s vulnerability to sinkholes. \nResearchers found that the southern tip and northernmost regions of Florida had anywhere from 500 to 1,000 feet of overlaying sediment to act as a buffer between the surface and the state\'s tumultuous limestone. Areas near the northwestern coast, however, were found to have as little as 10 feet of rock acting as a buffer. This coincided geographically with where sinkholes in Florida are typically reported. \nThe study\'s maps allow state planners to accurately zone residential and commercial areas. Once property is built over an area susceptible to a sinkhole, little can be done to stop a potential collapse, so avoiding the area altogether is the only sure way to avoid the disaster. \nAre Sinkholes on the Rise? \nFlorida\'s 2015 study found that, in addition to the natural geological events that create sinkholes, certain human activities\xe2\x80\x94such as water pumping and ground loading\xe2\x80\x94may make the Earth\'s surface more vulnerable. \nIt\'s a misconception, says Brinkmann, that sinkholes are increasing in number, at least in Florida. As suburban areas expand into regions that are more prone to sinkholes, the number of incidences of damage simply becomes more likely. \nWhile human activity can make the rate at which a sinkhole forms more rapid, he notes, it rarely causes geologically formed sinkholes to appear. Sinkholes have appeared in urban areas; however, these often result from the collapse of unstable infrastructure. \n(Read about one explorer\'s descent into a "fiery, gas-fueled crater.") \nIn 2013, Mother Jones magazine reported on a town in Bayou Corne, Louisiana, that was being swallowed by a sinkhole. The town is home to a massive industrial complex where hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has taken place, leading some to speculating that the rapid increase in underground drilling had created the sinkhole. \nBrinkmann didn\'t know of any studied link between fracking and sinkholes and said more research would be needed to confirm the link. \nWhile some states keep individual databases of sinkhole incidences, no national databases are available. \n'

S'Bhubaneswar: Voice for Child Rights in Odisha (VCRO), in collaboration with CRY \xe2\x80\x93 Child Rights and You, a leading child rights organisation, launched a campaign, \xe2\x80\x98Giving Children of Odisha A Healthy Start\xe2\x80\x99, to address the issue of child health and malnutrition in five tribal districts of Odisha.\n With almost 35% of total under-5 child population in the state under-weight, and 45% children in the same age-group suffering from anaemia, Odisha is one of the states which lag behind the National status of child health and malnutrition. The scenario is even worse in tribal districts of the state, as data suggest. Despite the recent decline in infant and child mortality (IMR and U5MR), the state still fares poorly in comparison to the National estimate. As NFHS 4 data reveals, 40 children (per 1000 live birth) still die within the first year of life, and 49 (per 1000 live birth) die before they reach 5 years of age.\n Keeping this ground-reality in mind, the aim of the six month long campaign will be to reduce the rate of child malnutrition below the National average, through increasing awareness and participation of the communities and concerned service providers at the village level, as stated by the organising NGOs.\nThe State Social Welfare Board and the Odisha Chapter of National Health Mission (NHM) welcomed the initiative by CRY and VCRO. They also expressed hope that this kind of awareness drives should be extended to the entire state.\n Litika Pradhan, Chirperson Social Welfare Board said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s significant that the campaign aims at coordination and convergence of government and non-government bodies to ensure health and nutrition for children and mothers.\xe2\x80\x9d She also advocated for children\xe2\x80\x99s cr\xc3\xa8ches at the village level, so that working mothers in the rural areas can avail the opportunity to ensure nutrition and care for their children.\n Dr. Prasant Saboth of NHM said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven though we have resources, changing the mindset of people is the biggest challenge. Health and hygiene are important components in reducing malnutrition, and this campaign will go a long way towards building mass awareness and ensuring best practices among the communities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n The campaign will reach out to more than 5000 children and 3000 mothers in 158 villages in 10 blocks of five backward districts, namely Mayurbhanj, Bolangir, Bargarh, Kalahandi, and Koraput, as the grass-roots level NGOs partnering CRY and VCRO will be involved in collection of data from the respective intervention villages to assess the nutritional status of children in the age group of 0-5 years.\n Explaining the plan and modality of the campaign Ashim Kumar Ghosh, Chief of CRY operations in Odisha said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe campaign is divided into two components. While the first includes growth monitoring of 0-5 years children in the mentioned districts and advocate for the development of malnourished children with the support of state agencies and communities, the second aspect aims at advocacy towards enhanced Implementation of Policy, Scheme, legislation and services at the grass root level on health policy for the mothers and children below 5 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Elaborating the approach of the action-intensive campaign, Bidyut Mohanty, Convenor of VCRO said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will work on both responsive and preventive ways, with all respective stakeholders bringing them at one platform to operate at the village levels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n \xe2\x80\x9cOn one hand the campaigners will identify critically malnourished children to refer them for further treatment and ensure that the communities are better prepared to prevent malnourishment; and on the other the service providers will be roped in to enhance the quality of services with certain non-negotiable mandate from the State,\xe2\x80\x9d Mohanty added.\n'

S'Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n Grenoble :  \nBody parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources have said.\n Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n "I had never found any significant human remains before", he told AFP on Saturday. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n "These remains are probably not from the same person", said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diableretsmassif in the Swiss Alps.\n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\nFirst Published: Saturday, July 29, 2017 11:03 AM\n Download the News Nation Mobile App and stay connected with top stories from India and around the world.

S'For all those days you wanted to wear a backless outfit and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away with it, thanks to pesky little back acne, these tips have come as your saviour!\nOnce you read them, you might have an \xe2\x80\x98aa-ha\xe2\x80\x99 moment, and wonder why you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing this already.\nSometimes, they\xe2\x80\x99re more annoying than the acne on your face, right? And frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little embarrassing.\n1. Bi-Weekly Scrub Down\nNo, no\xe2\x80\xa6you can\xe2\x80\x99t get lazy about this one. It\xe2\x80\x99s especially vital after a sweaty workout. Plus, a good scrub on your back will help you get rid of acne scars too.\nTake your time with this and scrub in circular motions, clockwise and counter-clockwise. A good scrub will do the trick.\n2. The 2-in-1 Cure\nWhatever the cause of your dandruff may be, because it\xe2\x80\x99s different for everyone, get rid of it! If it\xe2\x80\x99s a recurring problem, you may want to check with a dermatologist or trichologist.\nIn some cases, it may just be switching your shampoo/conditioner for a more targeted solution. What works well for me is apple cider vinegar.\nMix 1 part water in 2 parts of apple cider vinegar and place it in your shower cabinet. Rinse your hair with it after you\xe2\x80\x99re done conditioning. But don\xe2\x80\x99t rinse this out with water.\nThis will be great for your dandruff and for your back acne, since it acts as a toner. You can even use a cotton bud to apply it directly onto your back.\n3. Your Shower Routine\nSpeaking of dandruff related acne, just doing an an apple cider vinegar wash or using an anti-dandruff shampoo may not be enough. Try a conditioner that targets dandruff too, for that extra cleanse.\nNot only that, but you might want to change up your shower routine too.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all done it to save time \xe2\x80\x94 you get in, haphazardly apply soap, then shampoo, or vice versa. You rinse off shampoo or conditioner right before you get out of the shower, right?\nNa-ah, bad idea! The residue from your hair products may stay on your back and the towel isn\xe2\x80\x99t rubbing it off. This, obviously, clogs your pores which turns into\xe2\x80\xa6 you said it\xe2\x80\xa6 bacne!\nInstead, finish off your shampoo routine first, before cleansing off any residue on your face and body with body or face wash.\nGET HAUTERFLY IN YOUR INBOX!\n'

S'Ours is the story of the Gemini and the Leo. Gemini prefers being always on the move and is a free bird while the Leo needs attention. Gemini hates to be instructed while the Leo can\xe2\x80\x99t help stop back seat driving. And to top it all both demand perfection when it comes to their own whims.There is BeeGees to every Megadeth song, and its rom-coms only competing with non-fiction stories.\nThe twain shall never have met \xe2\x80\x93 but for love of travel and writing. Writing on Leo\xe2\x80\x99s part initially and traveling on Gemini\xe2\x80\x99s part.\nTravel is a bug that bites every sun sign. And so we fell; travels were an important part of our courtship. We even executed our own destination wedding \xe2\x80\x93 Udaipur \xe2\x80\x93 while parents fiddled and Nero tossed in his grave.\nMarried, the restless Gemini and the lazy Leo (perennial couch surfer over weekends) were at each other\xe2\x80\x99s neck \xe2\x80\x93 trying to figure life. Then, work took us to Malaysia for a long stint and changed us, with the way we had to live there. We graduated from being tourists to explorers during our weekend trips, as we visited other south-east Asian countries. The experience really hooked us on to traveling.\nMalaysia went, Switzerland arrived. We stayed at Leukerbad \xe2\x80\x93 a hot spring village high up in the Alps \xe2\x80\x93 and traveling grew upon us, like the Matterhorn. Soon, happiness out of traveling started compensating for everything that we felt was unfair in life.\nThen came the Stork and life changed; health dipped and a new manual to live life was handed over. The only solace was going through old pictures and nostalgia. So acute was the wanderlust that as the Sagittarius turned 3 months, we were off. Another travel a month later stretched the elasticity of tolerance. At 11 months in freezing winters, we were touring London, Paris and Amsterdam. Never knew that Sagittarius were so good at travel. Or we made him so?\nThese travels got us more intimacy, interest, and outlook. The need to capture those moments, what we experienced led to blogging, then clicking and then doing everything that kept the travel alive in our minds.\nWhile it started in 2011 as a personal need, its 6+ years now that our travels are growing with our writing and our writing is growing because of our travels. To take our traveling, photography and writing to a professional level, where others may inspire / benefit from us, we started Travel Jaunts in 2016.\nTo know more read here\n'

S'Art of Living Foundation, an NGO led by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, was apparently given a clean cheat by the governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in a case where the NGO was accused of damaging nearly 420 acres of the Yamuna floodplains.\n  The panel of Delhi and UP government said that there were no signs of lasting environmental damage in the site. (IE) \nArt of Living Foundation, an NGO led by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, was apparently given a clean cheat by the governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in a case where the NGO was accused of damaging nearly 420 acres of the Yamuna floodplains. Contradicting the earlier report, submitted by the seven-member panel set up by the green body, a three-member committee of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments in its report to the National Green Tribunal has said that there were no signs of lasting environmental damage where a cultural event in 2016 was hosted, as reported by Hindustan Times.\nAfter inspecting the site on Wednesday, the three member panel submitted a report stating, \xe2\x80\x9cthe land where the function of Art of Living was held is fully covered with grass along with some saplings/seedlings of various tree species. This kind of grass and natural regeneration of seedlings is not possible on compacted soil.\xe2\x80\x9d Earlier, a seven-member committee, comprising scientists \xe2\x80\x93CR Babu, AK Gosain, NK Labhasetwar and others\xe2\x80\x93had said the floodplains were damaged because it was levelled by compacting soil and several water bodies had been filled up.\nAs per the latest report, there is no significant size of wetland or water body noticed by the committee in the area used by the Art of Living. The committee further added that it also could not see any heap of debris on the site. The committee, referring to the Google earth images, said in its report that it could not locate any \xe2\x80\x9cheap of debris\xe2\x80\x9d on the site and it is evident that no \xe2\x80\x9cwetland or water body\xe2\x80\x9d is seen on the site prior to the event, PTI reported. Terming the matter \xe2\x80\x98fait accompli\xe2\x80\x99, the NGT had on March 2016 allowed the festival, as they could not ban it. Earlier, the NGT was told that rehabilitation of Yamuna floodplains will cost INR 13.29 crore and take almost 10 years, as per PTI.\n'

S'Lockheed Martin will build a deep space habitat inside a space shuttle cargo container.\nIf humans are ever really going to make it to Mars, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a bigger boat.\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s spaceships are built for short hauls to and from the International Space Station, a mere six or so hours away. These ships, like the Russian Soyuz, SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s Dragon, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming Orion capsule, are small, cramped, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have bathrooms or sleeping quarters. These space canoes simple won\xe2\x80\x99t do for nine-month ride to Mars. That\xe2\x80\x99s why NASA has commissioned six companies to research designs larger deep space habitats that will put the ship into spaceship.\nLockheed Martin is one of the companies that\xe2\x80\x99s developing a concept for NASA, and on Thursday it announced plans to build a life-size prototype of its Deep Space Gateway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nThis prototype won\xe2\x80\x99t fly into space, but it will help the company to refine its design. \xe2\x80\x9cForm, fit and function are key,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Pratt, Lockheed\xe2\x80\x99s habitat program manager told PopSci via email, \xe2\x80\x9cso we will be exploring the critical elements needed in this section of a larger deep space gateway to ensure functionality for the astronauts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo build it, the company will refurbish an old cargo container named Donatello, which was used to carry supplies to the ISS in the shuttle era. (The container\xe2\x80\x99s siblings, made by the Italian Space Agency, are Leonardo, Raffaello.) It will take about 18 months to refurbish the roughly 22-foot-long, 15-foot-diameter metal can.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe main objective is to ensure astronauts can utilize the space efficiently in combination with other elements of a full architecture,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pratt, although he admits there will be some limitations, since the astronauts won\xe2\x80\x99t be floating, like in space.\nLockheed says it will experiment with virtual and augmented reality (AR) to help speed up design and construction, and reduce costs, by identifying problem areas before they happen in real life.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pratt, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are exploring how we can use AR to integrate exercise equipment for the astronauts\xe2\x80\x94before allocating physical space for it in the habitat. We are also looking at modeling docking ports for other elements of the Deep Space Gateway, rather than cutting holes in the actual Donatello cargo container.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying out a variety of platforms for the \xe2\x80\x9cmixed reality\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the project, including Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Hololens and Meta.\nThere aren\'t many other details about what the Gateway might look like, but it will of course need life support equipment, protection from deep space radiation, and, for long-term missions, private spaces and exercise areas for astronauts\xe2\x80\x94similar to the International Space Station.\n"Because the Deep Space Gateway would be uninhabited for several months at a time, it has to be rugged, reliable and have the robotic capabilities to operate autonomously,\xe2\x80\x9d Pratt said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cEssentially it is a robotic spacecraft that is well-suited for humans when Orion is present."\nAfter Lockheed runs its tests, the company plans to hand over its prototype so that NASA can do its own analyses.\nIn addition to the habitat prototype, the company is planning to build an avionics laboratory to demonstrate Deep Space Gateway\xe2\x80\x99s ability to interface with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orion capsule. The module may also help astronauts train for scenarios that might arise in space, should NASA decide to send Lockheed\xe2\x80\x99s design into space.\nWhichever habitat design NASA funds will first set up camp in orbit around the moon in the 2020s, as a testing ground for long-duration missions to Mars in the 2030s.\n'

S"WASHINGTON  - U.S. economic growth in 2015 was the best since 2005 but the momentum ebbed significantly in 2016, with the economy notching its weakest performance since the recession, according to revised government data published on Friday.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that compiles gross domestic product data, said the economy grew 2.9 percent in 2015, an upward revision from the 2.6 percent it had estimated earlier. That was the strongest growth since 2005.\nThe government's annual GDP revision, which covered data from 2014 through the first quarter of 2017, also showed the economy performing worse than previously estimated in 2016.\nThe economy grew 1.5 percent last year, a slight downward revision from the 1.6 percent the government estimated earlier. It was the slowest growth since the 2007-09 recession ended.\nThe revisions to growth in both 2015 and 2016 mostly reflected swings in inventory investment and exports.\nOverall, the revisions did not change the economy's picture and confirmed that the current expansion cycle is the slowest on record.\nThe government will in 2018 publish a comprehensive revision of the GDP series, which will fully address a seasonal quirk that has tended to weigh on first-quarter GDP growth estimates. It hopes that GDP data remain free of the so-called residual seasonality beyond 2018.\n"

S'Key highlights:\nGovernment may not allow autonomous cars to run in the country\nIndia is not ready for driverless cars as it is against the employment generation\nThe government has invited Tesla to set up manufacturing unit in India\nIn a setback to driverless cars on Indian roads, the government may not allow autonomous cars to run in the country. The government has yet not made any decisions for the driverless cars in India, said Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari as reported Sameer Dixit.\nThe government is in an opinion that at current stage India is not ready for driverless cars as it is against the employment generation.\nCab services including auto rickshaws and regular cabs employ several people in India.\nIt was further reported that the government has invited Tesla to set up manufacturing unit in India and do business but also made clear to Tesla that the import duty will not be decreased.\nHowever, this comes as the Indian government has been wooing car markers such as Tesla, which has been working on its driverless cars. This may come as a setback to the company and others such as Uber in India which too have been working on driverless cars.\nThe government has been working on plans to reduce the number of cars on roads and to promote electric vehicles.\nIt said that electric vehicles may soon be part of public transportation system that will help to reduce the number of cars on roads.\nThe government is planning to get such buses which have high passengers facilities and runs on alternative fuels. It is also working on a proposal to develop Bus Ports in India.\nThe government to promote Bus Ports is looking for an option where NHAI may have a separate wing working delicately for Bus Ports Development. The NHAI wing with a Rs 1,000 crore equity may be opened.\n'

S' Meerut: Two dreaded criminals were gunned down on early Saturday morning after a fierce exchange of fire with a police team, an encounter which also rendered five policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), injured in a Shamli village.\n  A 17-member police team raided Bhura village on Saturday morning after getting a tip-off that notorious criminal Mohammad Naushad (29) was hiding in a home there. Naushad had as many as 20 cases of murder, loot and drugs supply registered against him and police had announced a reward of Rs 60,000 on any information leading to his arrest.\n  A terror in the region, Naushad was a member of Mukim Kala gang. He was also accused of murdering three persons in Karnal district of Haryana.\n  Ajay Pal Sharma, superintendent of police (SP) Shamli, told TOI: \xe2\x80\x9cNaushad had entered into the profession of contract killing and was gradually becoming a terror in the region. His end will surely go a long way in ensuring peace in the region, especially in Kairana, where he was highly active.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  According to sources, the police squad surrounded the house of Naushad and asked him to surrender. However, the accused and his accomplice, Sarvar Kamil-- also a criminal-- opened fire at the policemen, forcing them to retaliate.\n  SHO of Jhinjhana police station, Bhagwat Singh, and four other policemen were injured in the firing. After a brief encounter, both the criminals were shot dead. A .12 bore double-barrel gun, a pistol and a cache of live cartridges were found near the bodies of the criminals, police said.  Interestingly, the encounter brought back Bhura village into limelight. The tiny village has been notorious for harbouring criminals.\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAs many as 30 people were arrested recently for their alleged involvement in different criminal activities, including drug peddling,\xe2\x80\x9d the SP said.\n  Meanwhile, relatives of the two criminals slammed police for the encounter, claiming that the duo were \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent\xe2\x80\x9d.\n  Jameel Ahmad, the father of Naushad, said, \xe2\x80\x9cJust see our homes and judge our financial condition. Had my son been such a big criminal, as portrayed by police, is it possible that we would be living in such a dire condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Similarly, Hameeda Begum, the mother of Sarvar Kamil, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son was a labourer. He was killed because police wanted to score brownie points. I will approach NHRC against this fake encounter.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

S'9 Ways to Make the Best Paella Ever'

S'http://www.saveur.com/how-to-make-ultimate-paella'
p2009

S"Your complete guide to mastering the Spanish essential and scoring perfect soccarat \nPaella comes from the countryside around Valencia, where it began as a humble dish for workers in the orchards and vegetable fields. They simmered what ingredients they could find\xe2\x80\x94tomatoes, beans, rabbit, snails\xe2\x80\x94in a wide pan over the cuttings of orange trees before adding rice to absorb the flavors and make a filling midday meal. From there, paella drifted into villages and then cities and eventually became Spain\xe2\x80\x99s national dish.\nAlong the way, it became a tourist-trap staple. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate truth: Few restaurants serve decent paella, even in Spain. Industrially produced frozen versions, tricks like doctoring parboiled rice with coloring additives in place of saffron, and nontraditional ingredients like lobster and chorizo are a common, dispiriting sight.\nPaella is at its best cooked at home, made with traditional, shortcut-free technique and served the moment it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to an appreciative crowd. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I learned 20 years ago when I moved to Spain and married into a family with roots in Valencia for whom making paella has been a weekend ritual for more than 40 years. Nothing in Spanish cooking compares to carrying a massive pan of golden-brown rice out to the table, or the pleasures of digging into one. And while paella has a lot of details to sweat and rules to follow, the most important is simple: There is no such thing as a version for just one person. As one aunt in the family village in rural Valencia says, \xe2\x80\x9cPaella is really just an excuse to gather people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n1) Pick the Right Rice\nUse fresh, fragrant fish stock (below) when making shellfish paella. Include small, non-oily fish like red mullet and monkfish or cod heads and bones.\nPaella is a rice dish. Not a dish of rabbit or seafood along with some rice. Rice is the foundation, and everything is done to flavor the grains. Short- or medium-grain rice soaks up the most liquid and flavor. The best options are varieties from Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s rice fields like bah\xc3\xada, senia, and bomba. Bomba is the most forgiving of the three and the least likely to split open and lose its texture if the timing isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect. In a pinch, substitute Italian carnaroli, arborio, Calrose, or Japanese short-grain rice. Just avoid long-grain rices, which do a poor job of absorbing as much of the stock\xe2\x80\x94and all the flavor that comes with it.\n2) Get Extra Crispy\nAn ideal paella has a thin layer of toasted, slightly caramelized rice on the bottom of the pan\xe2\x80\x94the socarrat. Some cooks chase it by boosting the heat for the final minute or two of cooking, but beware: This greatly increases the risk of scorching. Even heat and proper timing are much safer. Practice makes perfect.\n3) Stick to True Ingredients\nThe question of what has a right to go in the pan can inspire garment-rending passion among paella partisans. Purists will argue there is only one true paella, the classic from Valencia that generally includes rabbit, chicken, two or three types of fresh, local beans, and snails or a sprig of rosemary. (Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s snails or rosemary: Valencian snails cling to this herb and bring some of its essence to the rice on their own.) But there are many combinations recognized by all but the most extreme traditionalists, from paellas that celebrate the arrival of spring produce, like rabbit and artichoke, to my mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s specialty, shellfish. Olive oil and tomatoes are obligatory, as are saffron and sweet Spanish paprika, which give the dish its aroma and color. One thing to leave out: chorizo. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not done. Along with being a slap in the face to tradition, it can overwhelm the other flavors.\nGo the extra mile to use bone-in meats and whole shrimp and prawns. Remember how all the other ingredients are mostly there to flavor the rice? Bones, shells, and heads mean deeper flavors in the stock that the rice cooks in.\n4) Don't Say 'Paella Pan'\nThe traditional wide, shallow pan gives the dish its name\xe2\x80\x94paella means \xe2\x80\x9cpan\xe2\x80\x9d in Valencian and Catalan\xe2\x80\x94and it allows the rice to cook evenly without being stirred, which aids the formation of a crispy socarrat. A generously sized pan also doubles as a communal plate.\nSize: To ensure even cooking, the rice needs to remain in a thin, consistent layer. The bigger the crowd, the wider your pan should be. The ideal size for four is 17 to 18 inches; for six it\xe2\x80\x99s 18 or 19.\nMaterial: Use pans made of a thin, conductive metal that will cool rapidly when removed from the heat so the rice won\xe2\x80\x99t overcook. In Spain, the typical pan is made from carbon steel. They\xe2\x80\x99re inexpensive but need special care and seasoning. If that sounds like a pain, enameled steel pans are a good compromise: They are more expensive but easier to maintain. Avoid heavy pans like cast iron, which don\xe2\x80\x99t cool quickly enough, and anything nonstick, since a little sticking helps develop a crispy socarrat.\n5) But Do Season It\nSaffron, tomatoes, and sweet paprika are necessary to any paella base. They provide color and subtle flavor.\nTo season a new carbon-steel pan, simmer an equal mixture of water and vinegar in the pan for 5 or 10 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap and water. Next, boil a few handfuls of rice in plenty of water in the pan for another 5 or 10 minutes. Discard the rice, wash the pan again, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ready for use.\n6) Mind Your Heat Source\nPaella is a dry rice, which means that the liquid must be completely absorbed at the precise moment the rice is done. Missing the mark can lead to undercooked grains or a mushy paella. Finding a wide, stable, and powerful source of heat that will evenly reach the entire pan is key to success. Outside, that means cooking in a fire pit over open flames or, less traditionally but no less effectively, on a grill. Inside, try straddling two or three stovetop burners and frequently rotating the pan.\n7) Serve it Right\nAs my mother-in-law always says, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can wait for rice, but rice can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for people.\xe2\x80\x9d Wait until all of your guests arrive before adding the rice. And don't stir. This is not risotto. Stirring means a creamy rather than dry texture, and you also won\xe2\x80\x99t get any socarrat.\nBefore serving, let the paella rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend and the starches in the rice to firm up so the grains will hold their shape. If the top layer of rice needs to cook more, cover the pan with paper towels or a clean kitchen cloth while it rests. And don\xe2\x80\x99t plate in the kitchen. Let your guests admire the finished dish at the table. The best way to honor the rustic roots of the dish is to have them eat directly from the pan with spoons.\n8) Pick Up These Tools\nTo make the ultimate Paella you need the proper tools.\nWide, shallow, and ideally made of carbon steel, a paella pan is necessary to cook the rice evenly. Use a long, flat spoon to mix things up before the rice is added. When cooking over an open fire, place the pan over a low, iron stand to keep it close to the flame.\n9) And Read Up\nLa Paella (Left) Grape, Olive, Pig: Deep Travels Through Spain's Food (Right)\nLa Paella by Jeff Koehler\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe liquid must be completely absorbed at the precise moment that the rice is al punto [at the point],\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote in my book La Paella. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here lies the challenge, in a shifting equation of pan, heat source, and liquid.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGrape, Olive, Pig: Deep Travels Through Spain's Food by Matt Goulding\n \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look closely enough, you will find the entire history of Spain within the perimeter of a paella pan,\xe2\x80\x9d opens Matt Goulding\xe2\x80\x99s chapter on Valencia in Grape, Olive, Pig, a deep dive into the dish synonymous with the region and the fight for authentic paella.\n"

S' Recent violence in Balochistan has again fuelled deep concerns about security for projects of the USD 57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) according to a report in the New York Times.\nEarlier this month, four Shias were murdered while travelling from Quetta to Karachi. Armed men riding on two motorcycles attacked their car on a highway close to Quetta in what police suspect was a sectarian attack.\nThough no group has yet claimed responsibility for the murders this has once again raised question marks about the future of the landmark transport and energy link that is being planned between western China to Pakistan\'s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.\nThis latest killing would be fourth such attack in recent weeks in volatile Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.\nFactions of the Islamist Pakistani Taliban group and the Islamic State have claimed two of the four attacks, including two in which six police officers were killed.\nThe Pakistan Army is of the view that soft targets are being attacked by militants, frustrated by defeats.\nAccording to another report published by The Diplomat, the issue of ensuring security of the CPEC has by and large been overshadowed by the promise of development\nThe primary question being bandied about is whether Pakistan is secure enough for undertaking such massive foreign investment engagement worth over USD 57 billion dollars.\n"The harsh truth of security risks in Pakistan is not totally lost on Chinese planners. After all, Chinese nationals in Pakistan have been targeted by extremists for many years. The Chinese government has, therefore, time and again raised this issue with Pakistan," says The Diplomat in a recent article.\nEarlier this year, authorities in Pakistan created a Special Security Division that included 9,000 army soldiers and 6,000 paramilitary personnel to provide security for Chinese nationals and projects.\nAdditionally, various types of CPEC security forces have been deployed in the provinces.\nThe Pakistan government has said that it has allocated Rs.1.8 billion (USD 17 million) for CPEC security in its budget for 2017-18.\nThese security assurances notwithstanding, it did not prevent the abduction and then killing of two Chinese nationals by Islamic State affiliates.\nIslamabad was placed under huge pressure at that point in time to rescue the kidnapped Chinese, but was unsuccessful.\nPakistan, according to The Diplomat, might be trying its best to ensure the protection of Chinese workers, but from China\'s perspective, all these measures will be discounted by the mere fact of any incidents.\nBeijing will continue to insist that Pakistan tackle this issue of security for the CPEC comprehensively and systemically.

S'(Representative image)\n NEW DELHI: Next time you land at IGI from an eastern European destination or Russia, don\'t panic if your checked-in luggage takes a long time to arrive. \n Customs authorities may be scanning your bags for any signs of dogs tucked away in suitcases. Cases have emerged of passengers trying to smuggle in dogs stuffed in suitcases. "The dogs are sedated or stunned and put in bags," said a source. They are sometimes stuffed in between clothes and other items to mask them during scanning. \n  "The animal goes through a lot of suffering. It is really painful to see them stuffed in bags," said the source. \n Last year, customs authorities managed to intercept several passengers trying to smuggle in pregnant dogs in a similar fashion. "These are some exotic breeds and they are sold in the local markets at a premium," said the source. \n One flyer was detained after a dog was found stuffed in her handbag. Authorities had hoped the practice would stop but it has resumed this year with the detection of new cases. \n "We keep a close watch on flights from Russia and those which arrive from eastern Europe," said the source. He said organized syndicates were at work but the customs authorities have been able to thwart their efforts. \n Customs sources said efforts are made to smuggle in several other breeds for "dog fights", which are popular in parts of Punjab and in some farm houses in the capital. They said investigations are on, involving various agencies to establish the trail. \n "These dogs are sedated, they are hungry and when they are made to fight they often end up killing the opponent," said the source, adding that the department was probing the cases to end the menace. Any passenger who plans to bring a pet has to obtain a certificate from the authorities in order to import the pet. \n In several cases customs officials have found that the same certificate was being recycled. "We have come across several cases where an attempt to recycle the same certificate was made. Our officers nabbed them each time," said the source. \n Senior revenue department officials said they are probing all the cases and are trying to find out the end beneficiaries of this smuggling racket. \n'

S"Retail listings for an upcoming refresh of the Acer Swift 3 suggest that Intel may have plans to release a new line of low-power quad-core i5 processors before the end of the year.\nAccording to PC Perspective, the retail listings state clearly that the processor is a quad-core Intel Core i5-8250U. That model number suggests it's not just a new quad-core i5, but a new 8th-generation processor.\nThis new processor is a bit of an oddity. To discuss why, let's have a look at its name. The i5-8250U name tells us a lot about this processor. First, that it's an i5, that it's part of Intel's 8th-generation lineup, and the U at the end means its a low-power chip -- the kind we see in razor-thin laptops like the Acer Swift 3.\nNow that we know it's a quad-core chip and a low-power chip, things start to get interesting. Currently, Intel Core i5 and i7 processors of the U-variety are only available in dual-core configurations. Some have hyperthreading, which means they can handle a number of processing threads equal to double the number of cores they have -- in this case four. But none have four physical cores.\nBut this new i5-8250U has not only four physical cores, but it also has hyperthreading. That makes it unlike any other U-series processor on the market today.\nAfter doing some digging, PC Perspective found a number of results in the Geekbench database for the i5-8250U, from upcoming laptops like the Dell XPS 13 9360. According to the Geekbench results, the quad-core i5-8520U with hyperthreading is capable of outperforming a current generation i5-7200U in multi-core performance by about 54 percent.\nIts single-core performance is about the same, though, so it's a boost you'll only notice when you're doing some serious multi-tasking or running processor-intensive applications.\nThat's beside the point, though. Sure, there are laptops out there with Intel Core i5 and i7 chips that can run circles around this i5-8250U, but they all use a lot more power. The only other quad-core i5 -- with hyperthreading -- on the market is a 65-watt chip. The exact power target of the i5-8250U is unknown, but its performance and name suggest it'll be substantially less. That should allow for a new breed of thin, yet powerful, workstation.\n"

S' Hyper Scoop: Motor Trend gets the first extended drive in a Tesla Model 3 \nThe Tesla Model 3 is here, and it is the most important vehicle of the century. \nYes, the hyperbole is necessary. The original Tesla Model S was a proof of concept\xe2\x80\x94it was possible to make a long-range electric vehicle. The Model X showed that you could make an electric SUV. But neither was affordable to the masses. And although the Chevrolet Bolt has shown that 238 miles of electric range is possible for less than $40,000, GM\xe2\x80\x99s volume aspirations are modest.\nNot so for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wants to blow out the walls of his Fremont, California, factory to build a half-million Tesla Model 3s every year.\nTesla gave Motor Trend an opportunity for an extended test drive with the Tesla Model 3 engineer. Following is Testing Director Kim Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 review.\nThirty-six hours before Elon Musk hands the keys to the first 30 purchasers of the new Tesla Model 3 electric car, we are waiting at a gravel parking lot at the corner of Mullholland Highway and Old Topanga Road in Malibu. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d somebody asks. \xe2\x80\x9c8 a.m.\xe2\x80\x9d replies videographer Cory Lutz as he and Travis Labella ready an arsenal of GoPros. Everybody\xe2\x80\x94photographers Brian Vance and William Walker, me, the video guys\xe2\x80\x94are taking turns shooting glances up Old Topanga. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching for a red car.\n8:05: \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I hear somebody say. He is Franz von Holtzhausen, chief designer for Tesla. And the red car is not only his, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the most awaited and speculated-about automobiles in years\xe2\x80\x94the Tesla Model 3, a car I\xe2\x80\x99ve overheard relatives talking about who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many cylinders their Camry\xe2\x80\x99s engine has. The scene felt a little like Hollywood paparazzi staking out Justin Bieber again, but this time it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hijacking. In a somewhat intimidating coup, Franz is going to let me tear up and down nearby Stunt Road in it (and what better name for a test route, eh?).\nFranz emerges. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s a pedigreed car designer after deployments with VW, GM (Pontiac Solstice), and Mazda, the guy\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly Hollywood-cast for the Tesla taste-meister part, in black jeans, back T-shirt, and aviator sunglasses. And his car appears remarkably similar to the prototype. \xe2\x80\x9cWe softened the nose\xe2\x80\x99s frown a little, and these proximity sensors are new, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with a shrug. At the back, the parting lines do elegant double-duty as air-separation creases, the charging port\xe2\x80\x99s flap flips upward now, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no external badging at all, besides the Tesla logos. Franz climbs into the passenger seat as I slide in on his left. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive it like you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d he commands. \xe2\x80\x9cLike you own it,\xe2\x80\x9d I correct him with a crooked smile.\nAnyone familiar with the Model S will quickly feel oriented with the smaller Tesla Model 3. There\xe2\x80\x99s the shifter stalk on the right (reverse up, drive down, depress for park), but now with extra taps once under way, it doubles as the cruise-control lever. All of the car\xe2\x80\x99s infographics reside on a 15.4-inch, landscape-oriented multitouch screen that\xe2\x80\x99s perched on an austere, sweeping, almost Scandinavian-simple, dash. And being a Tesla, it\xe2\x80\x99s an hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre tray of software delectables. Interior air (from subtle vents) is aimed by moving spots around on the display, even dividing the airflow to send it past each ear. There\xe2\x80\x99s a wallet-able security card that plugs in, acting as a valet key. Other coolnesses? Franz\xe2\x80\x99 car is a loaded version\xe2\x80\x94a Premium (add $5,000), meaning better-grade materials, wood-veneered dash, 12-way front seats, 12-speaker sound, heated rear seats, side-by-side inductive phone chargers, and that panoramic glass ceiling that nevertheless protects like SPF 90 sunscreen. A detail that tickled me: One of the assignable functions of the twin thumb scrolls on the wheel spokes is tilting and telescoping the steering column. Cool. You adjust the wheel with your hands right where they should be. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take a lot more miles than this to decide if the single off-center screen completely substitutes for a conventionally located gauge cluster, but I\xe2\x80\x99m already adapting to it. At least I can always see the mph display near my right hand position (upper left corner of the screen) versus it being often half-hidden behind spokes.\nTesla worked hard to increase interior space, and subjectively it succeeded. For a compact car, the Model 3 feels incredibly light and airy. The dash is pulled ahead and pressed down, but cleverly, the touchscreen is apart from that, close to your right hand. (It was embedded into the Model S\xe2\x80\x99 dash, constraining them to be equidistant.) The Tesla Model 3 has a trunk opening instead of a Model S-like hatch to delete the hatch-required crossmember, which shaves rear headroom. The prototype\xe2\x80\x99s trunk opening was criticized as too small; now it\xe2\x80\x99s yawning. And at 15 cubic feet, with a very low lift-over and 60/40 folding rear seats, it looks hungry for a surfboard or a bike. (Franz assures me of this; he\xe2\x80\x99s a cyclist.) Up front, the frunk is precisely sized to hold a carry-on suitcase. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s too big here,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to check it.\xe2\x80\x9d I tap the stalk down into drive, and we arc out onto Mulholland.\nAnd then the foot goes down. How does it drive? The gush of torque clearly indicates DNA shared with the Model S. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s a new motor specific to the 3; Franz is coy about its horsepower, but Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s claim of 0-60 in 5.1 seconds seems right when paired with this car\xe2\x80\x99s $9,000 long-range battery. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a choice of two batteries. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s trying to change the vocabulary we\xe2\x80\x99re using to describe it, from \xe2\x80\x9ckilowatt-hours\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crange.\xe2\x80\x9d Franz says the standard one (while still doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds) will travel 220 miles, but his provides 310 miles of range. (Supercharging is available but at a fee that\xe2\x80\x99s attractive compared to filling with an equivalent amount of gasoline.)\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s blanching, though, is the car\xe2\x80\x99s ride and handling. If anybody was expecting a typical boring electric sedan here, nope. The ride is Alfa Giulia (maybe even Quadrifoglio)\xe2\x80\x93firm, and quickly, I\xe2\x80\x99m carving Stunt Road like a Sochi Olympics giant slalomer, micrometering my swipes at the apexes. I glance at Franz\xe2\x80\x94this OK? \xe2\x80\x9cGo for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he nods. The Model 3 is so unexpected scalpel-like, I\xe2\x80\x99m sputtering for adjectives. The steering ratio is quick, the effort is light (for me), but there\xe2\x80\x99s enough light tremble against your fingers to hear the cornering negotiations between Stunt Road and these 235/40R19 tires (Continental ProContact RX m+s\xe2\x80\x99s). And to mention body roll is to have already said too much about it. Sure, that battery is low, way down under the floor. But unlike the aluminum Model S, the Tesla Model 3 is composed of steel, too, and this car\xe2\x80\x99s glass ceiling can\xe2\x80\x99t be helping the center of gravity\xe2\x80\x99s height. Nearly-nil body roll? Magic, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. Magic. And this is the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive starting point. The already boggled mind boggles further at the mention of Dual Motor and Ludicrous.\nThe photographers stare, looking bummed they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten everything they wanted, but Franz has got to go. He\xe2\x80\x99s heading up to that same key handover in Fremont. Handshakes, then the red car silently whooshes out of sight around a corner, leaving a vacuum that\xe2\x80\x99s instantly filling with questions: Have I ever driven a more startling small sedan? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. At speed, it gains a laser-alertness I haven\xe2\x80\x99t encountered before. By happenstance, associate road test editor Erick Ayapana had penciled me into a 2.0-liter Alfa Romeo Giulia to get here, and it feels like a wet sponge by comparison. Technological fascination? Besides what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already described, the Tesla Model 3 is available with Enhanced Autopilot ($5,000) and for another $3,000 what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving Capability\xe2\x80\x9d in the future. A lot of money, sure\xe2\x80\x94but how many $35,000 cars offer that? Or for that matter, standard over-the-air updatability?\nBut of course, Franz\xe2\x80\x99s car isn\xe2\x80\x99t $35,000. A quick summing of its features puts it at about $59,500 before incentives\xe2\x80\x94including $1,500 for the larger 19-inch wheels (18 inches are standard), and a grand for the red multicoat paint. (You can have any no-extra-cost color as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s black. Seriously.) And it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a while before $35,000 versions are built, but reservation holders can place an order for an upgraded Model 3.\nAs we pack up, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking. Recently I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending some time in Motor Trend\xe2\x80\x99s long-term Chevrolet Bolt EV and with every mile edging closer to calling it The Automobile 2.0. With its affordability, stress-free range, and delightful driving qualities, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that maybe this is where the second era of the car commences. Pause that thought. With the Tesla Model 3\xe2\x80\x99s performance, slinky style, fascinating creativity, and, critically, its Supercharger safety net, I think this is truly where it begins.

S"Mumbai: After Sanjay Leela Bhansali\xe2\x80\x99s secret meeting with Priyanka Chopra last year, there were rumours suggesting that Shah Rukh Khan will be playing the legendary poet-lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi and PeeCee will essay the role of his love interest Amrita Pritam.\nBut according to an entertainment portal, all those rumours were meme hearsay as a well-placed source has confirmed that it is Abhishek Bachchan who will slip into the late poet\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.\nIn order to do justice to the role, AB is apparently working hard to get in shape, has lost 12 kilos already and been listening to songs like \xe2\x80\x98Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind Par Woh Kahaan Hai\xe2\x80\x99 (Pyaasa), \xe2\x80\x98Woh Subah Kabhi Toh Aayegi\xe2\x80\x99 (Phir Subah Hogi), Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon, Kabhi Kabhi Mere Dil Mein, among others, that were written by Ludhianvi.\nTalking about Bachchan junior\xe2\x80\x99s preparations, the source said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile everyone is thinking that he isn't taking up projects because he is busy with his sports ventures, Abhishek plans to surprise all with his prep. He has been listening to Sahir's songs and is also reading up a lot on him. At the same time, he is also sweating it out in the gym, because he has to lose weight for the movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBhansali, who is currently busy with period drama \xe2\x80\x98Padmavati\xe2\x80\x99, starring Ranveer Singh (Alauddin Khilji), Deepika Padukone (Queen Padmavati) and Shahid Kapoor (Raja Rawal Singh), will begin shooting process real soon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe movie is expected to go on-floors soon and Sanjay Leela Bhansali along with the crew is figuring out the schedule,\xe2\x80\x9d added the source.\nEarlier, there was news of Irrfan Khan playing the lead in this untitled biopic.\n"

S'BJP MP Roopa Ganguly.(File photo: PTI)\n Kolkata: \nThe West Bengal CID today questioned BJP\'s Rajya Sabha MP Roopa Ganguly here in connection with a child trafficking case in Jalpaiguri, a senior official said.\nA team of the agency\'s officers went to Ganguly\'s south Kolkata residence to question her over her alleged meeting with former BJP women wing general secretary Juhi Chowdhury, an accused in the case who was under arrest, a senior CID official said.\nThe Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had unearthed a child trafficking racket earlier this year under which babies and children were allegedly sold, some to foreigners, through illegal adoption deals.\nGanguly later told reporters, "They wanted to ask some questions to solve the case and understand the situation. I told them what I knew. There is no charge against me. It is a political vendetta. I am saying this from day one. They are wasting my time."\nAlleging that false cases were slapped against BJP workers in the state, the Rajya Sabha MP said she believed that Chowdhury was "not guilty".\nThe state CID had also summoned BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and two other leaders for questioning in the same case.\nThe probe agency had arrested several people, including the head of a child protection agency in Darjeeling and a member of a child welfare committee, on charges of child trafficking.\nThose arrests were part of a widening probe into the adoption racket at the Bimala Shishu Griho, a children\'s home in Jalpaiguri town.\nChowdhury and the chief adoption officer of the children\'s home, Sonali Mondal, the home\'s chairperson Chandana Chakraborty and her brother Manas Bhowmik were arrested earlier.\nThey have been charged with selling about 17 children, aged between one and 14 years, to foreigners while falsely claiming that the children were handed over for legal adoption to needy couples after due screening and official procedures.\nThe CID had unearthed the child trafficking racket during raids at homes and nursing homes in the Baduria area of North 24 Parganas district, in Behala in the southern fringes of Kolkata and some other parts of south Bengal in November last year.\n'

S"Sonakshi Sinha is spending her vacations abroad and we are so jealous of her travel looks. The gorgeous actress is also very stylish and we know that for a fact.\nShe is also a travel buff and has recently been uploading her images from the long tour she has been on just after IIFA Awards 2017 ended.\nHer travel styles will definitely give you styling goals for the immediate next trip you are planning or are yet to plan.\nIn Hollywood\nSonakshi posted her latest picture from the Universal Studios in Hollywood where she too like every tourist posed in front of the studio banner.\nShe wore an olive green trench dress and she looked lovely. She combined the look with a cool pair of white sneakers, black shades and a black shoulder bag.\nIn San Francisco\nSonakshi posted a picture from San Francisco two days back and there too she actually killed it while posing in front of the Bay Bridge.\nShe was wearing a plain black tee along with a pair of blue denims and black boots. She had a grey cardigan tied on around her waist. She completed the look with a cap, shades and black boots.\nSurfing New York Streets\nSonakshi posted her image from last Saturday where she was roaming around the New York streets, looking super hot in a black pair of separates. She wore an oversized Kaftan top with a pair of over-sized pants. With the attire, she wore a simple pendant, black boots and her pair of black shades.\nThe look was totally a killer one.\nBeing 'Nature's Child'\nSonakshi's picture from beside a pond in New Jersey reflected the natural beauty in her. She wore a floral printed dress and beige strapped flats, looking gorgeous than ever.\nThe style book totally stunned us and threw light on how perfectly she has styled herself.\nAt Central Park\nSonakshi showered her ravishness as she posed at the Central Park in New York, wearing one of her best travel looks. She wore a simple pink trench jacket and a pair of embroidered jeans. She managed to look classy as ever, posing with her stances beside a lake at the park.\nBy The River\nJust after the IIFA Awards 2017, Sonakshi had started her tour and this was her first vacation picture beside the Hudson river in New York. She posed by the river, stunning as always.\nShe wore a floral printed spaghetti dress with a pair of rounded and half-rimmed shades. She looked too gorgeous, especially down under the sunset.\n"

S"I can see a grievously hurt animal on the road. What immediate actions can I take to save it? \nFirst, gently move the animal away from the road so it doesn't get run-down again. Immediately . contact the animal husbandry department or government vet in your area . Ring up an animal welfare organisation or gaushala and ask them for an animal ambulance. Explain the injury and ask them to bring first aid and pain killers with them. Offer to pay as all animal organisations get no money from any sources except public donations. If the ambulance is not available, take the animal to a hospital shelter or a vet. In order to stop bleeding wounds, place a compress of clean cloth or gauze directly over the wound, applying firm but gentle pressure, and allow it to clot. If a wound on the leg or foot is bleeding severely, gently elevate the leg until the wound is above the heart. This allows gravity to reduce blood pressure near the wound which will slow the bleeding. If bleeding continues after applying direct pressure and elevation, you will need to apply pressure to the artery supplying blood to the injury\nI witnessed an intentional animal run-down on the road. What action should I take?\nFirst, try to click the picture of the vehicle or person who carried out the intentional animal run-down. Note down the number of the vehicle. Call an animal ambulance on the spot, in order to provide medical aid to the animal. In order to stop bleeding wounds, place a compress of clean cloth or gauze directly over the wound, applying firm but gentle pressure, and allow it to clot. If a wound on the leg or foot is bleeding severely, gently elevate the leg until the wound is above the heart. This allows gravity to reduce blood pressure near the wound which will slow the bleeding. If bleeding continues after applying direct pressure and elevation, you will need to apply pressure to the artery supplying blood to the injury. \nThereafter, register an FIR with your local police station and provide them with photographic and other evidence to make your case strong. In order to register an FIR, you need to visit your local police station. The FIR is basically a written document that is prepared by the police, which has the details about your complaint (For example: locality, time, name of the complainant, alleged activity, etc.) There are no charges for filing an FIR. After that, the police conduct an investigation, which may include arrests. Once the investigation has been concluded the police will record all their findings in a charge sheet. If it is deemed that there is enough proof on the charge sheet the case goes to court. The court proceedings include the hearing of arguments, cross-examination, witness statements and presentation of other evidences etc.\n Intentional killing of an animal, without any just and reasonable cause is an offence under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960. This is also a cognizable offence under Section 428 and 429 of the Indian Penal Code. \nI can see emaciated animals in a zoo. Where can I report the same?\nFirst, you should report the matter with the zoo authority in your area. Gather photographic evidence. File an RTI application on the local forest department to gather more information. Then approach the Forest Department with your complaint. Send an email to the Central Zoo Authority with all the details and photos. The contact information of the central zoo authority and its members can be found at: http://cza.nic.in/contactus.html\nIf even that doesn't help, you can file a complaint of negligence (in taking care of Animals) and cruelty against animals (Section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960) and under the Wildlife Act 1972 against the manager/officer in charge of the zoo in the court of law. In order to register an FIR, you need to visit your local police station. The FIR is a written document that is prepared by the police, which has the details about your complaint (For example: locality, time, name of the complainant, alleged activity, etc.) Note, that there are no charges for filing an FIR. After that, the police conduct investigation, which may include arrests. Once the investigation has been concluded the police will record all their findings in a charge sheet. If it is deemed that there is enough proof on the charge sheet the case goes to court.\nThere are many municipal zoos that are illegal. The case should be filed against the municipal commissioner under Section 40 for running an illegal zoo and keeping wild animals in illegal custody. In order to be legal the zoo has to have permission from the Central Zoo Authority and if it does not have that, it cannot run.\n"

S'Photo shows rescuers beside working at the site where the remains were found\n GRENOBLE: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said. \n  Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday. \n  "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg. \n In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. \n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people. \n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts. \n "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. \n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". \n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps. \n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. \n'

S'THE fickle nature of the commercial sales ring looks like delivering Scott McAlpine\xe2\x80\x99s Eureka Stud another bonus, with Basara making an impressive winning debut at Doomben on Saturday.\nShiraz wins Winter Challenge0:40\nAn alarming betting drift ($7.50-$21) did not match the post-race comments of trainer Tony Sears, who noted Basara had given dual stakes-winning stablemate Pardoe (another Eureka product, but has since been sold to Hong Kong) a hiding in a track gallop some months ago.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe beat Pardoe by about six lengths before Pardoe won all those races,\xe2\x80\x9d Sears said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just kept going shin sore. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the price to be honest. She would have won by further had she not got that bump in the straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMcAlpine originally intended to sell Basara at last year\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Millions Yearling Sale in January, where she was catalogued in the fifth session. But a few days before the sale the filly was scoped and failed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no point taking her there because she would have just been handed back to us, so we kept her at home,\xe2\x80\x9d McAlpine said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had her scoped again in June and she was about 95 per cent right, so we just gave her some time.\nBasara defied a big betting drift to win at Doomben on Saturday. Picture: Grant Peters, Trackside Photography Source: The Courier-Mail\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were obviously worried about her breathing, but it was her shins that kept her away for so long. Based on that (win), she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have too many problems with the breathing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTegan Harrison said she felt \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged\xe2\x80\x9d that Sears had booked her for the mount because she was aware the stable had long held a good opinion of her.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never ridden a first starter that was so relaxed before the race,\xe2\x80\x9d Harrison said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe came here like she\xe2\x80\x99d done it all before.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBasara\xe2\x80\x99s winning time of 60.9 seconds for the 1050m was only marginally slower than the figure clocked by Stellarcraft (60.64) in the following race.\nLater, Steve Tregea made it a double for Darling Downs trainers when Prioritise streeted his rivals in the annual 2&3YO Plate.\nBacking up from a defeat last week, Prioritise relished the drop back to 1200m and sat on the speed before putting a space on his rivals in the straight. Oink ran on best of the rest to be second, but was four lengths astern of the winner, who clocked a slick 1:9.28 for the 1200m.\nTregea said Prioritise would be spelled immediately and possibly set for the summer carnival in Queensland.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t given up on him getting 1350m yet. He might get it in time, but he\xe2\x80\x99s appreciating 1200m at this stage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe surprised me a bit. I thought he would win on the turn, but not by that far. When you look at the time he\xe2\x80\x99s run, if he can keep doing that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to win plenty more races.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMeet And Greet a bright prospect\nBRAD Stewart tipped a bright future for Meet And Greet after he picked up the last Saturday QTIS bonus of the season at Doomben on Saturday.\nMeet And Greet turned the tables on his last-start conquerors Kubis and Eat My Trust with a strong second-up performance over the mile.\nKubis continued a frustrating run of minor placings in finishing second. Remarkably, he has never finished further back than fifth in 17 starts, with seven seconds, but just the one win.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have to say he\xe2\x80\x99s the unluckiest horse I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever trained. He has never missed a cheque, but he\xe2\x80\x99s missed out on a QTIS bonus again,\xe2\x80\x9d Rob Heathcote said.\nStewart gave the John Meagher-trained Meet And Greet the run of the race and provided a trouble-free path in the straight, although the rider suggested he would have done it differently had he had his time over.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have followed Kubis through and I wish I had done that because he would have won easier,\xe2\x80\x9d Stewart said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was just lost for a while and wanted to wait for the other horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStewart has no doubts Meet And Greet, who is one of just 15 live foals from the third crop of imported stallion Champions Gallery, will get further.\nJockey Brad Stewart was impressed by Meet And Greet on Saturday. Source: AAP\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a nice horse going forward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe relaxes well enough to get 2000m and John always felt that would be his go.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMeet And Greet was bred by BRC chairman Neville Bell, who races the gelding with his wife Mary. It earned Bell bragging rights at the next BRC board meeting, as Kubis\xe2\x80\x99 owners include fellow BRC directors Steve Gagel and Curt Schatz.\nBruce Brown had memories flooding back of his former good filly Emma\xe2\x80\x99s Affair when Khaleesi won her sixth race on Saturday. Brown paid just $5000 for Khaleesi, who has won $176,000 for connections in her 25 starts.\nShe is a grand daughter of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s Affair, who won nearly $500,000 in the care of Brown, highlighted by the then rich two-year-old race of the day, the Pelican Waters Queensland Millions.\nKhaleesi was ridden by Jim Byrne, who rated the 2016-17 season one of his best ever in the saddle, despite finishing second in the premiership to Jeff Lloyd.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFull credit to Jeff for breaking the record, but I feel I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a stellar year too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say it\xe2\x80\x99s the best season I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in terms of quality winners.\xe2\x80\x9d\nByrne rode 10 stakes winners for the season, highlighted by Group 1 winners Redzel and Capital Gain.\n'

S' Film posters of \'Mother India\' and \'Pakeezah\' made by late artist Brij Mohan Gupta have been selected to be showcased at the National Museum of Indian Cinema in Mumbai. \n The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has chosen the two posters by the city-based artist, who was popularly known as Devdas. \n  "This is a matter of pride for not only my family but for the entire state," said Chandra Prakash Gupta, who is Gupta\'s son. \n "The posters, which were made by my father nearly fifty years ago, will be displayed in the museum," he added. \n Chandra Prakash, who is also an artist, said his father\'s handmade posters, which were put up outside cinema halls and at public places, used to be the medium for film publicity in the city back then. \n The National Museum of Indian Cinema will help filmmakers, film students and critics to know and evaluate the development of cinema as a medium of artistic expression not only in the country but also in all parts of the world. \n In the museum, equipments like cameras, editing and recording machines, projectors, costumes, photographs and other film-related materials are also proposed to be kept. \n The costumes, sets, tapes, vintage equipments, posters, copies of important films and promotional leaflets will be displayed in a chronological order. \n'

S'Artists from India and Wales are sowing seeds of a collaborative performance project that explores questions around being a woman, identity and what shapes it\nA National Theatre Wales production. The company calls Wales its stage, and presents performances on beaches, in forests, at village halls and other offbeat venues\nHow do our encounters with other cultures mould us? What defines \'home\'? What does it mean to be a woman in India and the UK? When artistes of diverse expertise from two nations explore these questions, the result is a unique amalgamation of ideas. Sisters, a collaborative project between National Theatre Wales (NTW) and Junoon, has brought together 10 artistes of varied experiences from India and the UK with a commonality \xe2\x80\x94 all of them are deeply linked to the Indian subcontinent.\n(From left) Choiti Ghosh, Tejashree Ingawale, Sameera Iyengar, Sapan Saran, Sushama Deshpande and Kully Thiarai\nIn the research phase at present, a workshop with the Indian artistes was held in Mumbai this week, which was attended by NTW\'s artistic director Kully Thiarai. "I was born in India, and brought up in The Midlands, an industrial region of England. I know the feeling of belonging nowhere. People find it easy to box you. So, as a woman of Asian origin, I was viewed as a passive person, who cannot achieve much. And then I came to head this theatre company," says Thiarai, about the inspiration behind Sisters. "Instead of doing a retrospective on themes like Partition, we decided to explore the lives of women, and how history has shaped us all."\nSameera Iyengar, artistic lead of the theatre and arts movement, Junoon, agrees over the need to challenge assumed frameworks. "What we need is an act of imagination, rooted in varied perspectives, which is why, we wanted generational diversity, and diversity of language and practice among the artistes. Sushama Deshpande, for instance, has worked with tamasha and lavani performers, while Choiti Ghosh works in different languages and brings a perspective beyond Mumbai," she says.\nOne more workshop is lined up for October. In April next year, the production that emerges out of these sessions will be shared with an audience in Wales, with plans for a live feed in India. This will pave the way for the final outcome.\nArtistes from the UK\nKully Thiarai: artistic director, National Theatre Wales\nSudha Buchar: writer\nEmma Daman Thomas: artist/ musician\nSita Thomas: movement director/performer\nHussaina Raja: actor/ artist\nShanaz Gulzar: digital associate, digital, installation artist and set designer\nArtistes from India\nSameera Iyengar: artistic lead, Junoon\nSapan Saran: writer\nSushama Deshpande: actor, theatre critic\nChoiti Ghosh: object theatre practitioner, actor, and puppeteer\nTejashree Ingawale: artist, art director and illustrator\n'

S'Representative image\n New Delhi: \nShailja Mittal, Creative Head at Zapyle.com, an online marketplace for luxury and premium fashion, listed few trends:\n* As fall is around the corner, the major lipstick trend would be metallics. The trick is to downplay with one out of eyes and lips. If going for bold berry lips, a stroke of silver eyeliner would complete the look and keep up with the international trends.\n* For a sultry look go for taupes and greys. \n* The 1990s are not yet to take a backseat, so go will with good gold glittery lips and good amount of highlighter.\n* With the colour red making it to list of one if the major colour trends of Autumn/Winter 2017, flaunt red lips with bold black eyeliner. \n* Red, gold and taupe metallic, nude gloss and berry shades are a must in a vanity.\nInputs by Aakriti Kochar, make-up and hair expert at Oriflame, a leading Swedish skincare and cosmetic brand:\n* Electric orange lips and magenta stains are rocking this season contrasting with neutral colour outfits and even prints.\n* Frosty lip glosses are silver, bronze on neutral lips to add a hint of glamour to the simple summer look.\nOn social media and ramps, glitter lips have made the biggest statement this season. No one would relate glitter to summers but this year has definitely proven that wrong.\n* Metallic lip shades take us back to the rock and roll era and has become a hot favourite this spring season. Wear it wisely. Keep the look minimalistic for this one.\n'

S' (CNN)It may not be like the alien life in science fiction, but researchers have just confirmed the presence of something that may lead to life on Titan, Saturn\'s largest moon, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances.\nVinyl cyanide is a complex organic molecule capable of forming cell membrane-like spheres. While it may sound toxic, this chemical would be right at home on Titan, where significant quantities of it have been detected through data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a group of radio telescopes in Chile.\nTitan isn\'t exactly known for being hospitable. \nLarger than both our own moon and the planet Mercury, Titan is unique in our solar system. It is the only moon with clouds and a dense atmosphere of nitrogen and methane, which gives it a fuzzy orange appearance.\nIts atmospheric pressure is 60% greater than Earth\'s, meaning it exerts the kind of pressure you feel at the bottom of a swimming pool, according to NASA.\nSo it would make sense that the potential for life on Titan would have to look a little different. But Titan\'s atmosphere may not be much different than that of primordial Earth\'s -- and life found a way here.\nTitan also has Earth-like liquid bodies on its surface, but the rivers, lakes and seas are made of liquid ethane and methane, which form clouds and cause liquid gas to rain from the sky. \nThe surface temperature is so cold -- minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- that the rivers and lakes were carved out by methane, the way rocks and lava helped to form features and channels on Earth. \nThese methane pools on the surface are the kind of environment that could help vinyl cyanide molecules link together to form cell-like membranes, not unlike the basis for organisms on Earth. \n"The presence of vinyl cyanide in an environment with liquid methane suggests the intriguing possibility of chemical processes that are analogous to those important for life on Earth," said Maureen Palmer, lead study author and researcher at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe ALMA data confirmed what previous studies and simulations, like one from Cornell University in 2015, had predicted about the potential presence of this molecule on Titan. \n"Researchers definitively discovered the molecule, vinyl cyanide, that is our best candidate for a \'protocell\' that might be stable and flexible in liquid methane," said Jonathan Lunine, a Cornell professor who participated in the 2015 study. "This is a step forward in understanding whether Titan\'s methane seas might host an exotic form of life."\nTitan is also believed to have an internal liquid water ocean, like those on Europa, one of Jupiter\'s moons, and Enceladus, another of Saturn\'s moons. Earlier this year, NASA announced that Europa and Enceladus\' oceans have some or most of the ingredients necessary for life as we know it. \nBut how does Titan compare? First of all, it\'s bigger than Europa and Enceladus. It\'s also entirely unique in its possession of a dense atmosphere, which has obscured the observations that researchers have tried to make of Titan. And Titan doesn\'t have confirmed active geysers on its surface.\nGiven its complex chemistry, it\'s safe to say that Titan isn\'t hospitable to humans. But it is attractive to researchers. \nNASA\'s Cassini spacecraft mission to Saturn comes to an end later this year, but proposed mission concepts already exist for a type of "Titan airplane" called the AVIATR (Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance) and a submarine that would explore Titan\'s seas. \n"Saturn\'s moon, Enceladus, is the place to search for life like us, life that depends on -- and exists in -- liquid water," Lunine said. "Titan, on the other hand, is the place to go to seek the outer limits of life -- can some exotic type of life begin and evolve in a truly alien environment, that of liquid methane?"\n'

S'Frankfurt [Germany], July 29 (ANI): Exiled Sindhi nationalist leader and chairman of the Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM) Shafi Burfat has alleged that Pakistan Army and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Pakistan\'s judiciary system to target Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n"Pakistan Army and ISI have used the judiciary as a weapon to target Sharif. This has been done to make political parties in the country weak," Burfat said.\nHe said the verdict of disqualifying Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was also due to differences between the politicians of Punjab province and the army.\nBurfat claimed that Pakistan Army wants to take control of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and convey a message to China that its role in such projects is important and without the Pakistan Army support it is not possible.\nHe said the Pakistan Army wants China to hand over the complete responsibility for developing the CPEC project to it.\nBurfat said the Pakistan Army was also against the soft corner of some Punjabi politicians for India.\nHe accused Pakistan Army of supporting and sponsoring terrorism in India by naming India as its enemy.\nHe added that ISI is also supporting terror activities across border on name of Kashmir.\nBurfat further noted that Pakistan army wants its rule to take place over all the provinces of Pakistan.\nPakistan Supreme Court\'s five-judge larger bench headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa on Friday unanimously announced the verdict, disqualifying Sharif as it delivered the Panamagate verdict.\nThe court said that Sharif had failed to disclose his \'unwithdrawn\' salary as chairman of a United Arab Emirates (UAE) based firm at the time of the filing his nomination.\nAccording to reports, Page 23 and 24 of the verdict, the legal basis for disqualifying Sharif is explained.\nIt says: "As a sequel to what has been discussed in paragraphs 13 above, the following declaration and direction is issued:-\ni) It is hereby declared that having failed to disclose his unwithdrawn receivables constituting assets from Capital FZE, Jebel Ali, UAE in his nomination papers filed for the General Elections held in 2013 in terms of Section 12(2)(f) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 (ROPA), and having furnished a false declaration under solemn affirmation respondent No. 1 Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif is not honest in terms of Section 99(f) of ROPA and Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, therefore, he is disqualified to be a Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament);\nii) The Election Commission of Pakistan shall issue a notification disqualifying respondent No. 1 Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif from being a Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) with immediate effect, where after he shall cease to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan."\nThe apex court ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file a reference against the accused in an accountability court in six weeks, directing for the trial to be concluded within six months.\nIt is the second time in Pakistan\'s 70-year history that the Supreme Court has disqualified a sitting prime minister. In 2012 then prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani was disqualified over contempt of court charges for refusing to reopen a corruption case against President Asif Ali Zardari.\nAlso no Pakistani prime minister has ever completed a full five-year elected term. Most tenures have been cut short by military coups.\nWhile serving as the country\'s Prime Minister in 1993, Sharif was sacked by the then-president over graft allegations, while in 1999 he was ousted in a military coup.

S'As Amit Shah set foot in Lucknow today, three Samajwadi Party MLCs including Bukkal Nawab and Yashwant Singh quit the party to join BJP.\nSamajwadi Party MLC (Member of Legislative Council) and Rashtriya Shia Samaj founder Bukkal Nawab today tendered his resignation from the party, while singing a favourable tune for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath.\nThis comes close to reports that suggest that SP member and MLC Yashwant Singh has also quit the party to join BJP.\nWhile speaking to the press, Nawab said that the Samajwadi Party should change its name to Samajwadi Akhaada (arena) since it has become a wrestling ground.\nSpeaking in context of the tussle between father Mulayam Singh Yadav and son Akhilesh Yadav for party ranks and reins, Nawab added that, "When he (Akhilesh) is not with his father, how can he be with the people."\n\'I MIGHT GO WITH BJP\'\nThe Rashtriya Shia Samaj founder insinuated that he might join BJP if called upon and that many others from SP might follow suit soon.\n\'YOGI IS DOING GOOD JOB\'\nOn Uttar Pradesh\'s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\'s work report so far, Nawab said, "Yogi is doing a good job... there hasn\'t been any scam at least."\nThe resignations coincide with Amit Shah\'s Lucknow visit today that will extend for two more days.\n"Amit Shah will interact with party office bearers from Awadh, Kashi, Gorakhpur and Kanpur regions. He will also interact with various district presidents and district in-charges," UP BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said on Thursday. \nThe BJP National President will also hold a meeting with Yogi Adityanath to attend to issues of governance and plug gaps with his deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya.\n'

The Institutions of Eminence are proposed to have greater autonomy compared to others.\nThe Cabinet\xe2\x80\x99s approval, however, was deferred and the regulations were referred to the group of ministers when concerns were raised over the impact of greater autonomy. The group held two meetings in June and have suggested changes to the regulations.\nUnder the proposed regulations, the institutions will be at liberty to admit foreign students and hire foreign faculty up to 30 per cent of the total strength of the class and teachers, respectively. Worried that this provision could adversely affect the reservation policy currently applicable to student admission and faculty recruitment, the group of ministers has asked HRD Ministry to categorically mention the affirmative action policy in the regulations.\nFurther, the UGC regulations have a provision under which private players with an impressive proposal to set up an institution of eminence can have their plans green-lighted by the government in shape of a \xe2\x80\x98Letter of Intent\xe2\x80\x99. The LOI can be transferred to another player under exceptional circumstances. The panel red-flagged this clause fearing misuse of the LOI.\nAs for the rule prescribing minimum enrolment of 15,000 students in 15 years, the group has recommended that the institutions should be free to fix this number as they may like to specialise in an area which may not require a large number of students.\nThe panel has suggested that collaboration between these institutions and a foreign university should be limited to foreign institutions which figure among the top 500 in global rankings. It has also raised concern about the freedom given to such institutions to keep the duration of courses flexible. The ministers were not convinced about the provision, especially in the context of Delhi University rolling out a four-year undergraduate degree programme and then withdrawing it. The HRD Ministry is yet to take a final call on the suggestions.\n'

S' image courtesy: PTI \nLucknow: After Bihar and Gujarat, convulsions were witnessed in the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh where four MLCs quit their parties on Saturday, with a BSP MLC even joining the BJP.\n Former Chief Minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of being behind the resignations of his party MLCs.\n The three SP lawmakers are Bukkal Nawab, Yashwant Singh and Madhukar Jaitley, while the BSP legislator is Thakur Jaiveer Singh, who was a minister in the Mayawati government during her 2007-2012 reign.\n Singh\'s nephew Upendra Singh \'Neetu\', the district panchayat chief of Aligarh, also joined the BJP.\n Bukkal Nawab was very close to former party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and owed his prominence to him until he decided to side with Akhilesh Yadav in the turf war within the party earlier this year. Yashwant Singh is a close aide of independent legislator from Kunda, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias \'Raja Bhaiyya\'. There is speculation that he may switch to the BJP.\n Madhukar Jaitley, also a close aide of Mulayam Yadav, was a state minister level functionary in the Samajwadi Party government and was advisor to Akhilesh Yadav on externally aided projects, including Lucknow Metro.\n Jaitley threw his weight behind Mulayam Yadav after his son overthrew him and took over as national president of the party. Jaitley was one of the few who openly rebuked and challenged Akhilesh Yadav in his hey days as Chief Minister and slammed him for the "shoddy treatment" meted out to the senior Yadav.\n Bukkal Nawab is facing many probes currently, specially of land grabbing.\n Nawab had created waves some time ago by saying he would be happy to carry the first brick to Ayodhya for the construction of a grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya and that he would also financially contribute to it.\n The resignations from the SP coincided with the arrival of Amit Shah in the state capital on a three-day visit to interact with party leaders.\n Alleging a conspiracy, Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of indulging in political corruption from "Bihar to UP". "People are watching everything," he said.\n "The BJP is behind the resignations of SP MLCs. Bukkal Nawaab is an old member of our party. I had also gone to meet him on Eid. What is the reason that he has changed... They (BJP) lure some MLCs to their side," he said.\n Nawab said the SP has become a "Samajwadi akhada (wrestling ground)". He attacked Akhilesh Yadav and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath.\n "If they call us, then I might go to the BJP," he said, adding that many more SP members will join the BJP.\n While in Bihar, the BJP effected a switch-over by the JD-U, led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, to form a coalition government, in Gujarat, six Congress MLAs have resigned, threatening the chances of senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in the August 8 Rajya Sabha election. \n'

S"While there's nothing quite like running outdoors, unruly weather sometimes makes it impossible. For those rainy or blustery days, there's the trusty treadmill. Whether you're a beginner runner or have a few marathons under your belt, we've got a running workout for you. From a run that mimics going up and down San Francisco hills to another that has you ascending a mountain, you'll swear you're actually running outside. \nGetting started: If you're new to running, then try our 40-minute beginner treadmill workout. The workout combines walking and running to get your heart rate up while also priming your body for distance and speed.

Once you're ready, try out our 300-calorie workout, or if you need something a bit shorter, try our 30-minute beginner treadmill workout.\nWalk-jog workout: Once you're feeling a bit more comfortable on the treadmill, give this workout that mixes walking and jogging a chance. The 60-minute workout alternates between walking briskly, jogging, and running slowly; plan to burn around 300 calories. If you're in a rush, this 42-minute version will put you to work.\nSwitch to sprints: Once you feel like you've mastered the walk and jog combination, try stepping up the pace. This 30-minute interval workout is a great way to start increasing your speed. Mix up your routine with a sprinting and walking workout to help boost your endurance. Then, once you're ready for a tough challenge, give this 60-minute interval workout a try.\nSweat like a celebrity: This 30-minute treadmill workout from celeb favorite Barry's Bootcamp is full of intervals, hill work, and sprints, which will challenge both your endurance and your speed. Or give the 25-minute version a try. In short: these workouts are anything but boring. Get ready to push it. \nPyramid intervals: Keep boredom at bay with this 30-minute pyramid interval treadmill workout. By changing your running speed every minute, you'll also be winning the war against weight gain. Have more time to spare? Up the ante with our 45-minute pyramid interval treadmill workout. If you have even less time to spare, you'll love the challenge of this intense 25-minute pyramid interval workout; designed by a running coach, it will help you become a faster runner.\nGet in, get out: If you're short on time but still want to get in a solid run, then give this 20-minute treadmill workout a chance.

This ladder run, with the speed intervals increasing in duration as the workout progresses, is just the thing if you're looking for an extreme challenge!\nThe 500-calorie workout: If you can find about 60 minutes in your day to do this high-interval treadmill workout, then you'll burn about 500 calories. Do it four times a week, and you're already down half a pound.\nClimb a hill: This treadmill hill workout will show you what it's really like to run in San Francisco.

If you prefer to walk up a hill, give this treadmill incline workout a try.\nGo for a hike: Even if you can't make it to Yosemite, this treadmill hike workout will mimic what it's like to be in the great outdoors. The 45-minute workout involves walking and jogging up steep inclines, so you'll strengthen your quads and work your butt. If you're in a hurry, try this 20-minute version instead. \nGraduate to a mountain: Once you've hiked up some hills, why not try for a mountain ascent? This treadmill mountain climb mixes a brisk walking speed with steep inclines.\nBuild strength: The treadmill doesn't have to be just about running. This 60-minute workout alternates between intervals on the treadmill and classic strength-training moves. This 45-minute plan starts on the treadmill and then finishes off with 15 minutes of strength training. \nBlast fat: Intervals are one of the best ways to fight stubborn belly fat. Say goodbye to your muffin top with this 45-minute treadmill interval workout. You'll run your heart out and walk out with 421 fewer calories than you came in with! And just so you don't get bored, we're throwing in a fat-fry interval-mashup treadmill run.

S'Washington D.C. [USA], July 29 (ANI): Busting the myth, a study has found that after a sleepless night, males may prefer to sleep while sleep deprivation has no affect on mating behaviour of females.\nThe findings indicated that sleep-deprived males showed little interest in courtship while a lack of shut-eye had no effect on the mating behaviour of females.\n"An organism can only do one thing at a time," said corresponding author Michael Nitabach from Yale University in New Haven, US.\n"What we have discovered is a neuronal connection that regulates the interplay between courtship and sleep," Nitabach added.\nThe study was conducted on Drosophila.\nNitabach -- in collaboration with scientists from Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Southeast University in China, and University of San Diego -- investigated neuronal activity involved in both behaviours.\nSexually aroused males got little sleep, while aroused females slept more.\nThe male flies\' behaviour is easily explained as an adaptive behaviour, say the scientists: Falling asleep during sex is not a good way to pass on your genes.\nIt could be that females cannot afford to pass up an eligible suitor no matter how tired they are, Nitabach stated.\n"It appears that whichever behaviour has the highest biological drive suppresses the other behaviour," he said.\nIn addition to identifying this sex-specific behaviour, the collaborative team also revealed that underlying functional connections between the distinct neural centers that mediate sex and sleep.\nThe researchers noted that humans could possibly have a similar mechanism for adjudicating when the drives for sleep and sex collide.\nThe results appear in the journal Nature Communications.

S'"You have an emotional attachment to your oil diffuser," my boss said with a smile and a laugh. And she was right; after two years of relying (partly) on essential oils as a tool to mitigate anxiety and depression, I really do have an emotional attachment to it. Or at least, the ritual of diffusing. In fact, I can clearly remember the first day I considered giving it a shot \xe2\x80\x94 I was on the couch in my therapist\'s office, asking for alternatives to medication.\nShe rambled off a list of suggestions to me: "Take lavender capsules, try Bach Rescue Remedy drops, add valerian root extract to your tea, and definitely get an oil diffuser . . . start with lavender." I went out immediately to a natural market, bought a diffuser and some lavender oil, and went home to begin a practice that would soon become an everyday ritual.\nThough not a cure-all, essential oils have been studied and shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression, at least a little bit. And while I don\'t credit aromatherapy for the entirety of my recovery and everyday balance, it really has become a fantastic form of self-care, something that is imperative to prioritize when you\'re dealing with any form of mental illness, mood disorder, or emotional turmoil.\nThere are dozens of natural treatments for anxiety, but I\'m by no means suggesting you ignore the option of medication \xe2\x80\x94 I found a way to deal with my own mental health via alternative medicine, and if that\'s an avenue you\'re interested in exploring, I\'d highly suggest using aromatherapy and oil diffusing as part of your holistic, comprehensive mental healthcare routine, especially before bedtime! Plus, who doesn\'t want their room to smell like soft lavender and eucalyptus as they drift off to sleep?\nHere are some oils that can be soothing for anxiety, according to different scientific studies.\nLove what you\'re reading?

S'As passenger traffic continues to climb, Oakland International Airport (OAK) today opens the first phase of its expanded International Arrivals Building (IAB) in Terminal 1. The $45 million construction project, which began in August 2016, includes 13,000 sq. ft. of additional space incorporating a new baggage carousel and an expanded passenger primary processing room.\nWith international passenger traffic up 106% over last summer, the expansion of OAK\xe2\x80\x99s IAB allows the Airport to better accommodate growing demand and increasing passenger levels arriving from foreign markets in Mexico, England, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Azores. In 2018, Paris and Rome will join OAK\xe2\x80\x99s international roster of nonstop markets operated by Norwegian Air.\nThe expansion of OAK\xe2\x80\x99s IAB facility includes the following upgrades:\nA more modern, expansive, clean design.\nA building addition to accommodate an expanded queuing and processing area to improve the primary screening operations, including expanded use of Automatic Passport Control (APC) kiosks.\nNew and updated restroom facilities, seismic upgrades and building systems infrastructure upgrades.\nNew lighting, flooring, finishes, expansive windows and skylights introducing natural light into the new and existing space.\nReconfigured offices for Customs and Border Protection services.\nOAK\xe2\x80\x99s Terminal 1 facility was constructed in 1962, and houses the International Arrivals Building (IAB), which was built as an extension of Terminal 1 in 1972. Prior to today\xe2\x80\x99s opening, international arrival operations had been limited to approximately 300 passengers per hour, the equivalent of one widebody aircraft. However, with the expanded facility, approximately 600 passengers per hour can be accommodated, meaning two widebody aircraft can be processed simultaneously. Additionally, the new space accommodates 16 automated passport control kiosks, doubling availability from 8 previously.\nOperations will continue while Phase II construction activities are completed, which include removal and replacement of the existing baggage carousel, completion of interior finishes, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) support space and restroom renovation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection operates within the IAB, meaning the area effectively serves as a U.S. border. Collaboration with CBP throughout the design and construction of the project helped to minimize impact for on-going operations and ensure that the facility meets all required standards.\nSource:- Port of Oakland\n'

S'New Delhi, Jul 29 (PTI) She is known for being one of the fittest and most stylish divas in Bollywood but Shilpa Shetty Kundra said there was a time when she was not sure of her fashion choices and made a lot of mistakes. \nThe actress, who was in the capital to walk for designer Monisha Jaising at FDCI India Couture Week, said her style has evolved over the years and now she only believes in creating her own statement rather than following any trend blindly. \n"I try to do different stuff and I think thats the common thread between Monisha and me. Also, she likes to be a trendsetter and not a trend follower and I totally understand it. So, Ill rather not do what somebody has done and than follow that trend blindly. \n"Style has to be very personal. And Ive made a lot of mistakes in my career. But you learn. And experience is something that cannot be brought. I love the fact that Ive learnt from my own mistakes as it has made me wiser," Shilpa told reporters post the fashion show here. \nDonning an exquisite silk brocade gown with golden weaves, Shilpa looked stunning as she strutted her beauty at the ramp. \n"I think this is (dress) like a take on the Indian sari. They used brocade and they modernised it. I love Indian attires especially the saris so much. You can do so much with it and the most beautiful aspect about the sari is that its timeless and will never go out of style. It can make a statement anywhere." \nHowever, the thigh-high slit outfit landed her in a spot of bother after its lengthy train got stuck on the ramp. But, Shilpa said such things were normal. \n"The ramp had a couple of nails so the thing got stuck but I think it happens. The beauty of this garment is that it just got that spring in my steps and I was like, Yes here I am, and then that nail was trying to get me down. But I enjoyed doing this. \n"I think at the end of it all, you have to look great in what you wearing and people should like it. I feel great in this piece." \nInspired by the Opera, Monishas collection, harmonised with the evolution of displaying ones finery and the mesmerising dynamics of performance on stage. \n"What I wanted to show in this dress was a western style which was the Opera. You can be in any part of the world if youre wearing this piece. And I wanted an Indian girl with an international feel. So, I wanted to use Shilpa in the Indian fabric and drape her in this modern gown," the designer said. \nThe collection set the stage with a theatrical variation of fabrics composed of velvet metallics, tulle, chikankari, Italian organza, banarasi, metallic satin and much more. \nWith a dramatic ethnic flair infused with contemporary details, the assortment of pieces featured lehengas, evening dresses, cocktail saris, evening gowns, crop tops and ball skirts.

S'The bill introduces the much-needed concept of affixing liability on a manufacturer or producer and even a product seller in certain specified circumstances for any personal injury, death or property damage caused to a consumer resulting from defects in manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging, or labelling of any product.\n NEW DELHI: A new consumer protection bill that is likely to be tabled during Parliament\'s ongoing monsoon session is seen as the next big game-changer for the common man, replacing as it will legislation that has been in force since 1986 when the economic landscape and consumer awareness were in their infancy. \n Among a slew of measures, the bill proposes to establish an investigating, prosecuting, reviewing and recommending body -- the Central Consumer Protection Authority, on the lines of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), headed by a Commissioner -- to launch inquiries, either suo motu or on a complaint or direction from the government, into violations of consumer rights and to launch prosecution in an appropriate court. \n The bill introduces the much-needed concept of affixing liability on a manufacturer or producer and even a product seller in certain specified circumstances for any personal injury, death or property damage caused to a consumer resulting from defects in manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging, or labelling of any product. \n One of the interesting new additions to minimise frivolous litigation is the requirement to deposit 50 per cent of the total amount that the defendant has been asked to pay in terms of the appealable order in case he intends to prefer an appeal to an Appellate Commission. \n The penalty for filing a frivolous complaint has also been proposed to be enhanced from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 to minimise baseless and false complaints. \n In keeping with the changing times, the Bill defines e-commerce while at the same time empowering the Centre to make rules for preventing unfair trade practices in online trade. It also brings new forms of trade under the purview of the act to safeguard the interests of consumers further. \n Once the new law comes into force, the liability of manufacturers and service providers, online and offline, will not be primarily limited to any consumer who buys goods or avails service but towards all consumers. This leads towards the class action suits introduction in the country in which all affected consumers will derive benefits. \n The three-tier structure for adjudicating consumer disputes still remains in the form of district, state and national commissions but with enhanced values at each level looking at the current market realities. \n "We believe that the consumer is the most important stakeholder in the supply chain and bringing higher value to the consumer is sine quo non for survival in a competitive business environment... It is, therefore, important that such consumer protection laws are within the constitutional framework while providing effective, quick and realistic remedies to the consumers," FICCI Secretary General A. Didar Singh told IANS. \n "The consumer protection bill is sought to bring substantial modifications to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to address emergence of global supply chains, rapid development of e-commerce and to tackle misleading advertisements, telemarketing, multi-level marketing and direct selling," he added. \n Bejon Misra, a consumer policy expert and founder, Consumer Online Foundation, told IANS: "The three-decade-old Consumer Protection Act in its present form is an inefficient piece of legislation not keeping pace with the new market dynamics, multi-layered delivery chains, innovative and many times misleading advertising and marketing machinery." \n "In the changing market place with e-commerce and financial products having made heavy inroads, the outdated Consumer Protection Act of 1988 serves little or no purpose in protecting consumers. Blatant misleading advertisements are selling norms today. Thus the only way to protect consumers from falling prey is to introduce authoritative powers, strengthening of consumer commissions, class action suits, penalties and host of other measures as exist in the draft amendment bill," Ashim Sanyal, COO of NGO Consumer VOICE, told IANS. \n  The bill, originally drafted in 2015 and tabled in the Lok Sabha last year, was subsequently sent to the Standing Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs. It now awaits cabinet approval. Even though it figures in the Lok Sabha\'s list of business for the monsoon session, this can happen only after the cabinet\'s nod. \n'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): \'The Roots- a performing arts society\' recently organised a short play theatre festival at Studio Safdar, Delhi, giving young artists an opportunity to experiment with their creativity.\nThe event witnessed performances from Delhi University theatre circuit, amateur theatre groups and mono-act performers, followed by a discussion with \'Pink\' actor Sudhanva Deshpande.\nThe performers shared the stage with Jana Natya Manch, Delhi\'s oldest street play theatre group, whose was the closing performance of the evening.\nThe season one of \'short play festival\' on Friday observed a heavy rush of audience who were present at the event to enjoy experimental insights and crisp depictions of performances and hence, the studio space was full packed.\nIn an exclusive interview with ANI, \'Jana Natya Manch\' actor and director, Sudhanva Deshpande stated, "I am delighted that the short play festival is happening here at Studio Safdar because there is a lot of theatre activity in the city and not enough opportunities for young people to showcase some of their work in progress- experimental work, work that is not entirely finished yet but they would like to show it, share it, showcase it, get responses and so on."\n"And this festival becomes one of the few platforms that are available for this kind of showcasing and sharing and learning from each other that young theatre people always need," added Deshpande.\nThe event has been scheduled for two days, July 28 and 29, hosting seven teams each day.\nTalking about the aim behind this event, Prabhjot Singh, art curator, The Roots said, "I feel that from rehearsals to performance there is no room for the artists to experiment with their creation and therefore, an event like short play festival is important to create a space for the theatre artists to experiment and explore the dimensions of a theatrical production."\nStudio Safdar is an independent and non-funded space for arts and was established in 2012. May Day Bookstore and cafe equipped with leftword books is also a part of this artistic space. (ANI)\n'

S'Nagpur: Taking forward the causes that she works for under Gram Project at Paradsinga, artist Shweta Bhattad is currently showcasing various aspects of agricultural concerns at an art residency organized by Foundation of Indian Contemporary Art at New Delhi. \n"FICA gives a public art grant which I received last year in December to organize a Land Art Festival. They invited me for a solo show in Delhi this month to show what we had done with the grant. Since it was about the work done under our Gram project, I decided that all those connected should also come along," says Shweta who opened the show on July 13 with her performance.\n Her act titled \'Barren Orgasm\' was designed to highlight the harms caused by BT cotton, GM crops, extensive use of chemical fertilizer and loss of land which will lead to destruction of farming. Slathered with mud, which the group carried from a pond they have built in their village, Bhattad sat on a raised structure with a chastity belt tied around her waist. \n"There was a video titled \'Vagina Vomit\' which was placed over the chastity belt. It showed chemical fertilizers, imported seeds, BT cotton, GM crops being vomited out. We also added the sounds made while vomiting to it," she explains.\nA red cloth tied to the chastity belt was spread through the room and ran into the next one. "The visitors walked in on that red carpet and reached where I was sitting to watch the video. It conveyed that what appears very welcoming first is actually a deadly trap," says Bhattad.\nBhattad\'s sibling Aditi, who too is an artist, also did a performance titled \'Are you Nero\'s Guest\'. In it, she wore a nine-yard sari and sat writing the names, age and date of demise of farmers who had committed suicide over the last three years. \n"The total figure of dead farmers was on her back which she had created by tanning herself. The postcards made with seed paper where handed over to the visitors," says the artist. \nThere were empty wooden frames on the walls below which drawers were placed. Details of various works done by the Gram residency were kept in the drawers that were made at \'Maker\'s Adda\' in Nagpur. \n"We displayed pictures and details of seven paintings in fields for which social workers, artists and farmers had collaborated at the Land Art Festival held at Paradsinga in December last year. Seeds of lal bhaji, spinach and fenugreek were sowed to grow motifs which depicted farmers\' issues," says Bhattad.\nA \'rakhi\' workshop was also organized at Delhi which was conducted by two village women from Paradsinga. "The rakhis are made with indigenous Indian cotton. We procure the cotton from Akola, it is spun and dyed with natural colours in Wardha and rakhis are made in Paradsinga. A seed is placed on every rakhi which can be sowed," says Bhattad. \nA group of singers and writers performed songs, which spoke of farmer concerns at the art residency at Delhi. The show will conclude on Aug 12.\n'

S"While initially, OnePlus was not no consistent when it came to giving software updates to its devices, the scenario has changed now. OnePlus owners now receive software updates on a regular basis.\nNot only the current flagship OnePlus 5, but older models like OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3 also getting software updates pretty often. Anyway, today we will talk about an upcoming OxygenOS update for OnePlus 5. Although it yet to release, a French publication called Frandroid has come up with some interesting details about the update. According to the report, OnePlus has already worked on the next major update for OnePlus 5.\nThe OxygenOS update is said to carry the build number 4.6. The French website claims to have obtained the information from reliable sources that are familiar with OnePlus's update road map.\nTalking about the changes that the update will bring, the update is likely to improve the phone's battery to a great extent. The update will basically make some notable changes to the kernel, which is OS part responsible for managing communications between different parts of the phone.\nThe OnePlus 5's battery life will be long if the phone's kernel is equipped with Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) technology. EAS is said to better take advantage of the Big-Little architecture implemented in flagship chipsets like the Snapdragon 835 that is inside the OnePlus 5.\nSo after EAS is enabled, the OnePlus 5's battery will last for a longer period of time. For those who are not aware, EAS is enabled in Google's Pixel and Pixel XL devices.\n"

S'Taxpayers have to file their GSTR 1 by September 5\n About 80 lakh taxpayers, over a dozen clarifications from the government, nearly 500 official workshops and six MasterClasses, and just one rate correction amid calls for more revisions... Despite some initial hiccups, the government and India Inc are quite satisfied with the first month of the country\xe2\x80\x99s new indirect tax regime \xe2\x80\x94 the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nThe next major challenge that everyone is gearing up for, however, is the uploading of invoices and filing of returns, which will begin from August-end and culminate in September.\nWhile the Finance Ministry as well as industry leaders believe the initial transition since the GST rollout on July 1 has been quite smooth, both concede it would still take another couple of months for businesses to get completely used to the new levy and its nuances. \nA silver lining for both has been that end customers have not been impacted much, unlike in the past when new levies were introduced.\n Ministry gearing up \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe phones have stopped ringing. We expect the next rush and call for clarifications to start towards the end of August, when taxpayers will begin filing returns,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Finance Ministry official.\nWhile the GST Network has started the facility of uploading of invoices, taxpayers have to file their GSTR 1 for July by September 5.\nOver 71 lakh existing taxpayers have already registered for GST. Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said on Saturday that over 10 lakh new registrations have been approved. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother two lakh applications are pending and in process,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nEach of them will upload three returns and many assessees could face problems in uploading and filing.\nAccording to Tejas Goenka, Executive Director, Tally Solutions: \xe2\x80\x9cClients have been quite happy and we have had a large number of registrations and many unregistered dealers are also registering to ensure input tax credit.\xe2\x80\x9d But sounding a note of caution, he pointed out that the actual testing of the IT infrastructure and GSTN is yet to be done.\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe government has been very prompt in issuing clarifications on certain issues, which has helped ensure a smooth rollout of GST,\xe2\x80\x9d said MS Mani, Senior Director, Deloitte. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the technological preparedness will be tested when the input tax credit matching begins and returns are filed in September.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMeanwhile, the Central Board of Excise and Customs is now working on a new IT project for mapping of GST taxpayers. This will allow officers to know the details about each taxpayer in their jurisdiction with a click on their computer.\nOther pending issues remain the setting up of the Anti-Profiteering Authority and the finalisation of the E-way Rules and system.\nThese are expected to be taken up in the next meeting of the GST Council, in August.\n Clamour for review \nIt could also take up some more proposals for a review of tax rates under GST, as many sections of the industry \xe2\x80\x94 ranging from religious institutions to textile manufacturers, solar equipment providers and sanitary napkin makers, have been calling for a review of the rate due to a higher incidence.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe GST Council will also look into a number of issues that were referred to the sectoral industry groups so that specific issues are addressed. These include input tax credit to the leasing industry, multiple value-addition levels in the textile sector making compliance challenging, and inverted duty structures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mani.\n'

S'Supermodel Miranda Kerr\n San Francisco: \n"I also dry-brush each morning. It\'s a great way to get the circulation going and remove dead skin cells. I start with my feet and legs and work my way up in quick gentle strokes," Kerr told MyDomain.com, reports femalefirst.co.uk.\nShe added: "I like to apply the Noni Glow Body Oil prior to brushing, and then shower. The hydrating and nurturing oils stay on the skin, and it leaves my skin feeling super soft."\nAnd Kerr has hailed her own beauty products as the reason behind her flawless complexion.\nAnd the star will apply numerous items from her range, including the Energising Citrus Mist, as well as Eye Cream, a face tint, to her face every morning.\nShe explained: "I use all my Kora Organics products and credit it for the health of my skin. In the morning, I use the Kora Organics Foaming Cleanser, Energising Citrus Mist, Hydrating Day and Night Cream, Eye Cream, and Tinted Day and Night Cream (a healthy alternative to foundation). \n"I use the mist as a toner and also throughout the day to keep my skin hydrated. At night, I use the Cream Cleanser, Balancing Rose Mist or Calming Lavender Mist (I alternate), Soothing Day and Night Cream, and the newly launched Noni Glow Oil--it contains high levels of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals to smooth, nourish, hydrate, and brighten the skin."\nShe also uses anti-ageing products "once or twice a week", as well as a face mask.\nShe said: "I use the Age-Defying AHA Exfoliator once or twice a week and also apply the Hydrating or Purifying Mask twice weekly, depending on what my skin needs.

S'Mumbai: The Government Railway Police (GRP) in Mumbai have arrested a 55-year-old labourer for allegedly making calls warning of bomb blasts at railway stations earlier this month. An anonymous call on July 13 had sent the railway police into a tizzy, but the information proved to be wrong.\nFile Photo\nIt was Babu Chauhan who had called the control room at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and said that a blast was likely at the Churchgate station in South Mumbai, said a GRP official on Saturday.\n The police traced the call to a PCO in Mahim, central Mumbai, and zeroed in on Chauhan from CCTV footage.\n Chauhan, a native of Gujarat who works in the catering industry and lives on a footpath in Mahim, was arrested on Friday under section 177 (furnishing false information) of IPC, the official said.\n He was produced in a court on Saturday which remanded him in judicial custody till August 4.\n After reading about terror attacks in newspapers, he feared similar attacks in the city and called the GRP control room to warn the police, the official said.\n "After reading about attack on Amarnath pilgrims in Kashmir, he called the control room the next day and warned about a blast at Churchgate," he said.\n Chauhan had also called earlier, on July 5, asking the police to increase the security at railway stations. "He called the control room and said, Tomorrow is July 6. Increase the security at railway stations as explosives are being brought from Kharghar," the official said.\n Though probe is on, it seems that Chauhan didn\'t have any mischief in mind, the officer said. \n'

S'Mumbai: The Mumbai Congress on Friday threatened to \'gherao\' the Mumbai University (MU) campus if the varsity does not declare results of all examinations by July 31. Talking to reporters, Mumbai Regional Congress Committee chief Sanjay Nirupam said Education Minister Vinod Tawde and Minister of State for Education Ravindra Waikar should resign for the "inordinate delay" in declaration of results.\nFile Photo\n In pic: Sanjay Nirupam\n The Congress workers will \'gherao\' the MU campus if the varsity does not declare results of all examinations by July 31, he said. Nirupam\'s remarks came a day after the university extended the non-instructional (lecture-free) days by four more days to concentrate on exam paper evaluation.\n In a circular issued yesterday evening, officiating Director of Examination Deepak Wasave extended the non- instructional days till July 31, for the arts, law and commerce faculties. The university has taken the decision in a bid to meet the July 31 deadline for result declaration set by Chancellor and Governor Vidyasagar Rao.\n Earlier this week, firing a fresh salvo against the BJP-led Government in Maharashtra, bickering ally Shiv Sena sought resignation of Tawde and MU vice-chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh over the `mess\' in the university\'s online assessment process.\n Aaditya, Yuva Sena chief and the son of Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, met the governor at the Raj Bhavan here on Monday and sought action against Tawde, a senior BJP minister, and Deshmukh. \n'

S'Ahmedabad/Bengaluru: The Congress was on Friday jolted by the exit of six of its legislators in 24 hours, with one more likely to leave, even as it accused BJP President Amit Shah of engineering defections in Gujarat by "money and muscle power". Late in the evening, the party was bracing to fly off its Gujarat MLAs to Bengaluru.\nParty sources claimed that in a last-ditch attempt to prevent any more legislators from resigning and defecting to the BJP in view of the August 8 Rajya Sabha elections where veteran leader and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi\'s Political Secretary Ahmed Patel is contesting from Gujarat, it was imperative to keep the rest of the flock aloof from allurements.\nThe Congress legislators are reportedly to be bundled out later on Friday night on an Indigo flight to Bengaluru.\nThree MLAs, Balwantsinh Rajput, Tejashree Patel and P.I. Patel, quit on Thursday and joined the BJP, while three more submitted their resignations to Speaker Ramanlal Vora on Friday but did not join the BJP till evening.\nThose who resigned on Friday are veteran Congress legislator Ramsinh Parmar, MLA from Thasra constituency and chairman of the prestigious Amul Dairy, Chhanabhai Chaudhary, MLA from Vansda constituency, and Mansinh Chauhan from Balasinor.\nCongress Chief Whip Balwantsinh Rajput, MLA from Siddhpur who quit on Thursday, is rebel leader Shankersinh Vaghela\'s close relative. Rajput, within minutes of joining the BJP, was named for the third Rajya Sabha seat for which Patel has filed his nomination. BJP president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani are the other two party candidates.\nOne more Congress MLA, C.K. Raolji, who is believed to be the closest to Vaghela, was on his way to resign, but turned back midway "for final negotiations" with the BJP, a close confidante of Raolji told IANS.\n"Till evening, everyone thought that he quietly went to the Speaker\'s official residence and resigned, but he is yet to do so. Some final negotiations (with the BJP) are going on. Of course, eventually, he will resign," the source said.\nLocal Gujarati TV channels and the rest of the media assumed that Raolji had quit and had proclaimed so, leading to confusion, he said.\nAICC media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala rushed here from New Delhi.\nThe issue also rocked the Rajya Sabha, which witnessed repeated adjournments as angry Congress members accused the BJP of "stealing" party lawmakers.\nThe Congress accused the BJP government in Gujarat and at the Centre of pressurising Congress legislators to quit the party and join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nIn Ahmedabad, a Congress statement signed by Surjewala and five MLAs, including three who claimed the BJP tried to lure them with crores of rupees among other things, said: "Hunger for power has made the rulers blind to the extent that Congress MLAs are being offered bribe of crores of rupees, election ticket and other allurements."\n"By misusing money power, muscle power and state power, MLAs are being asked to meet Amit Shah for changing their loyalty and vote by way of defections. This is disparaging to every constitutional norm, independence of the electoral process and majesty of democracy itself. All this is being done when Amit Shah himself is a Rajya Sabha candidate."\nIt was alleged that Scheduled Tribe Congress MLA Punabhai Gamit, a three-time legislator, was being threatened and lured.\n"He was forcibly detained and an attempt was made to give a bribe of Rs 10 crore with allurement to meet Amit Shah," according to the statement, which also has Gamit as a signatory.\n"Similar attempts to buy the loyalty of Congress MLAs Mangalbhai Gavit and Ishwarbhai Patel were made by misuse of muscle power, money power and state power.\n"It is the innate belief of these MLAs in Congress ideology and their impeccable integrity that deterred the conspirators and resulted in an absolute failure of their conspiracy to cause defections through allurements," the Congress said.\nBesides Surjewala and senior Gujarat leader and Congress MLA from Abdasa Shaktisinh Gohil, the statement has been signed by legislators Punabhai Gamit, Mangalbhai Gavit, Ishwarbhai Patel and Anand Chaudhary.\n'

S' GRENOBLE: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said. \n  Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday. \n  "I had never found any significant human remains before," he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg. \n In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. \n Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people. \n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \n Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts. \n "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. \n "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say". \n Just 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps. \n A DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before. \n'

S'The resolution, moved by veteran BJP MLA Shankarlal Tiwari, sought an end to the centuries-old practice of \xe2\x80\x98era\xe2\x80\x99, where farmers let loose their cows post-harvest to allow them to graze. The practice, members said, was adding to the number of stray cows.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelow Poverty Line (BPL) card holders get ration and other government facilities. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we make a law to force every BPL card holder to rear at least one cow? If they don\xe2\x80\x99t keep cows, they will not get BPL facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d This suggestion by BJP MLA Murlidhar Patidar came as members of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, while discussing a \xe2\x80\x98non-government resolution\xe2\x80\x99, admitted that stray cows were raiding agricultural land and proving to be a menace to farmers.\nThe resolution, moved by veteran BJP MLA Shankarlal Tiwari, sought an end to the centuries-old practice of \xe2\x80\x98era\xe2\x80\x99, where farmers let loose their cows post-harvest to allow them to graze. The practice, members said, was adding to the number of stray cows.\nWhile the debate occasionally veered towards cow protection and the supremacy of cow milk, gaumutra (urine) and gobar (dung), the focus was largely on the ill-effects of \xe2\x80\x98era\xe2\x80\x99 and the ways in which the problem of stray cows could be tackled. Lawmakers also admitted that monetary and commercial considerations, besides lack of fodder and encroachment on grazing land, were the main reasons why owners were abandoning their cows.\nPatidar, whose constituency has the \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x99s first cow sanctuary\xe2\x80\x9d, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cow has lost the value it once enjoyed because people no longer see any monetary benefit in rearing cows.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Patidar, who made the suggestion on forcing BPL families to rear cows, said the sanctuary was yet to become functional but \xe2\x80\x9cso many cattle owners inquire about it that I get afraid. (Once it opens), 40, 000 to 50,000 cows will be released in it within 24 hours.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 The sanctuary, spread over 472 hectares, claims to be able to hold 5,000 cows.\nR D Prajapati, the BJP MLA from Chandla in Chhatarpur district, said he was afraid that if the menace of stray cows was not stopped, he would find it difficult to even enter his constituency. \xe2\x80\x9cMy constituency has two problems: nilgai and stray cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, while seeking a cow sanctuary in his constituency. \xe2\x80\x9cLet there be no development\xe2\x80\xa6 just create one sanctuary and this will be the biggest service to farmers,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 he said, adding \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers run the risk of snake and scorpion bites but don\xe2\x80\x99t leave their farms because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want stray cows to damage their crops\xe2\x80\x9d.\nMLA Divyaraj Singh, who represents Sirmour in the Assembly, suggested that cows should be tagged to establish their identity and that cows without owners should be given the status of \xe2\x80\x9cwild animals\xe2\x80\x9d and kept in enclosures in national parks or forest lands.\nVeteran BJP MLA Shankarlal Tiwari, who moved the resolution and later withdrew it after being promised of a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent solution\xe2\x80\x9d by the animal husbandry minister, said the menace had assumed \xe2\x80\x9calarming proportions\xe2\x80\x9d, affecting the very livelihood of farmers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe government should come out with a law or rules to stop the practice of era,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 he said, adding that animals that damage crops should be kept in kanji houses, with the government providing subsidy to run them.\nKanji houses are facilities where cattle are kept till owners reclaim them. Animal Husbandry Minister Antarsingh Aarya said a committee with representation from all political parties would be formed to find a permanent solution to the problem. Besides Aarya, the committee would have the agriculture minister and the cow protection board chief as members, he said.\nTalking about the steps taken by the government, he said the cow sanctuary in Agar district was nearing completion and would be opened after the monsoons, followed by another sanctuary in Rewa. He said gaushalas and kanji houses for stray cattle were being set up at 107 places along the banks of the Narmada.\nSenior BJP MLA Kedarnath Shukla said cattle rearing was \xe2\x80\x9cbecoming very difficult due to the shortage of fodder and grazing land. Earlier, the practice of era lasted for a very short period; now it goes round the year.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Calling it \xe2\x80\x9cexplosive information\xe2\x80\x9d, he said farmers pack their cattle into trucks and release them 10 or 20 km away, never to reclaim them.\nParticipating in the debate, Congress MLA from Pichhor, K P Singh, said the resolution was moved \xe2\x80\x9cnot by the need for cow protection but by the difficulty cattle were posing to farmers\xe2\x80\x9d. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe government that prided itself on welfare of farmers and protection of cows has been in power for 14 years, but has not been able to find any solution.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n'

S'New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): Bollywood diva Shilpa Shetty Kundra looked ravishing in Opera red- gold Benarasi brocade gown as she walked the ramp with her usual grace and style for designer Monisha Jaising at the ongoing India Couture Week 2017 in New Delhi.\nThe actress exuded glamour on the runway and looked every inch the diva that she is. She complimented her stunning look with diamond neckpiece, plum eyes and nude lips. Needless, to say, the beauty diva sets the stage on fire as the showstopper.\nSpeaking to media post the event, Shilpa said this was the first time she walked the ramp for Monisha and just loved her collection.\n"I think she (Monisha) is fabulous as a designer. Her outfits make you feel glamorous. I wore one of her outfits at the IIFA awards and I have never been complimented so much. It\'s very sweet of Monisha to have me as a showstopper. I feel really happy to have walked the ramp for her," she said.\nGiving an insight about the outfit Shilpa wore, the designer said, "What I wanted to show in this dress is a very western set up which was the Opera so you could be anywhere in the world and I wanted a very Indian look with an international feel. So, I chose Shilpa for that, because she is one of our Bollywood stars who has an international feel. So, I wanted to use her in this Indian outfit and drape her in this modern gown."\nMonisha Jaising showcased her most colossal collection, \'Opera\' on the fifth day at India Couture Week 2017.\nDemonstrating the individuality of these fashion ensembles, the collection radiates elements of exuberant fabrics and airy silhouettes. The collection sets the stage with a theatrical variation of fabrics composed of lame, velvet metallics, tulle, chikankari, Italian organza, banarasi, metallic satin and much more.(ANI)\n'

S'New York [U.S.A], July 29 (ANI):U.S.President Donald Trump traveled to Long Island and promised to provide safety to the communities by "dismantling and eradicating" the deadly criminal cartel Mara Salvatrucha MS-13 street gang.\n"Together we\'re going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities and we\'re going to destroy the criminal cartel MS-13 and many other gangs," Trump said, as he was addressing enforcement officials at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood about the notorious MS-13 gang and asking for more resources to combat illegal immigration.\nTrump promised his administration would "dismantle, decimate and eradicate" MS-13 and also issued warning to immigrant criminals that he is seeking to deport them.\n"We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you and we will deport you," Trump said.\nTrump also claimed that laws are written to "protect the criminal" and "not the officers".\nHe told the law enforcement officials that the "laws are stacked against you" and need to be changed.\n"We\'re going to enforce our laws, protect our borders and support our police like our police have never been supported before," Trump said.\nThe violent gang known as Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, originated decades ago among Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles and has since built a criminal network that extends across the US, with thriving pockets in the Washington, D.C. suburbs and here on Long Island, just an hour or so east of New York City. It\'s estimated to have 10,000 members nationwide.\n"We\'re getting them out," he said. "They\'re going to jails and then they\'re going back to their country, or they\'re going back to their country period."\nHe also appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of arresting officers who protect suspects\' heads while putting them in police cars.\nThe gang has strongholds in the US, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The Obama administration\'s Treasury Department sanctioned the gang in 2012 as a transnational criminal organization. (ANI)\n'

S"It's not income, but it can still make or break your business.\nAs an entrepreneur, there are plenty of metrics, numbers and ideas that you have to monitor, track, and keep an eye on both the day-to-day side. One of the most important aspects of managing a business is net income.\nIncome is one of the first metrics and data points that every entrepreneur learns about, either in business school or from work experience, and clearly occupies the majority of management time. There's a host of other areas that entrepreneurs, especially Millennial entrepreneurs, focus on when developing a business idea (like sustainability or customer service). All of these ideas require net income to bring them from concept to reality.\nIncome is clearly important and the calculation is relatively straightforward (revenues minus costs)--but there's another financial metric that is arguably more important for small businesses.\nCash flow is an idea that, if you think back to your Accounting 101 class, might seem to be a lot like net income, and this even applies to how cash flows are presented and analyzed. Both metrics apply to a certain period of time, have several different components, and measure certain inflows and outflows of funds through your business.\nEven with these similarities, there is one particular fact that is critically important to keep in mind as you compare net income to cash flows as you manage and grow your business--they aren't the same. The specifics of cash flow analysis, measurement, and comparison between net income and cash flow are numerous enough to occupy an entire book (or class).\nDon't worry, we won't go through all of them!\nLet's take a look at a few of most important differences, facts, and items to keep in mind as you compare your net income and cash flow for your business. As always, be sure to work with your CPA or other financial professional familiar with both your business and financial goals before making any changes or strategic decisions.\n1. Net income and cash flow are not the same.\nOne of the most common misconceptions that I see as a CPA working with entrepreneurs and small business owners is that people see net income and cash flow as the same thing. This couldn't be further from the truth.\nFor example, while accounts payable (bills you owe) and accounts receivable (payments you are due) play an important role in calculating net income and other financial statements, the changes in the accounts and items truly influence cash flow.\n2. Bills cannot be paid with net income.\nNet income, as you and I both know, is one of the most important financial metrics that you have to monitor, but you cannot pay bills with net income. Your suppliers, partners, other vendors, and employees need to be paid with actual cash flows.\nYou like getting paid in cash (actual currency), correct? Keeping an eye on the cash inflows and outflows of your business enables you to pay your bills, grow your business, and develop new business ideas.\n3. You can figure out your cash flow starting with your income.\nNet income and cash flow are different, but they are related, so let's take a quick look at an example of calculating your cash from your net income.\nYour business starts off with reported income of $1,000, and the following information is available. Your accounts receivable increased by $200 during the month, and your accounts payable increased by $500 during this month.\nSo, taking a step back to analyze the performance of your firm on a cash flow basis you start with your net income of $1,000, subtract the increased in accounts receivable ,since you are owed this money but have not yet been paid. Then, you add the $500 increase to your accounts payable since, although you have incurred these services, you have not yet paid for them.\nLong story short, your income for the period in question is $1,000, but your cash flow for the same period is $1,000 - $200 + $500, or $1,300.\nApplying these differences across organizations of different sizes and you can quickly see just how important understanding the differences between net income and cash flow truly are. Cash flow truly represents the lifeblood of how business operates, pays its bills, and continues to grow it operations, so it's critically important for every entrepreneur to understand these differences.\nIt may sound complicated or abstract, but it is not all that complex, and gaining a better understanding of these concepts will help you manage your business more effectively.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n"

S"Zeng was born in the city of Wuhan in central China in 1964, the son of laborers from a printing factory. The lower social status of his family allowed them to survive relatively unscathed through the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution during which time many of the country\xe2\x80\x99s intellectuals and professionals were executed. His mother, however, was often persecuted for her fondness for colorful clothing and publicly shamed by the Red Guards, who left abusive graffiti outside her place of work and family home. The changes rippling through China left no demographic untouched. \nZeng showed promise as an artist at an early age, illustrating in his notebooks to break the tedium of the new Maoist syllabus. He neglected every subject other than art, refusing to study anything that did not engage him creatively. Eventually he dropped out of high school in 1980 to work at a printing factory and took painting lessons privately in his free time. He first applied to the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts in 1982 but failed to gain entry due to his poor performance in math and science. Undaunted, he took the entrance exam five years in a row and was finally admitted to the university in 1987. \nDuring this time he became enamored of German Expressionism, the style that would inform his later work. Upon graduating from university, Zeng gained immediate critical acclaim with \xe2\x80\x9cHospital Triptych No. 1\xe2\x80\x9d, a study of the distress and horror he encountered during daily visits to a neighborhood sanatorium.\nRise to Fame\nThe government assigned him a job at an incipient advertising firm in 1991, and with the help of David Ogilvy\xe2\x80\x99s manuals, he achieved a relative amount of financial stability. After the celebrated art collector Johnson Chang bought his first paintings in 1993 for $2000 each, Zeng moved to Beijing in search of a more dynamic environment.\nLeaving Wuhan was difficult for the artist, who missed the familiarity of known faces and found himself psychologically alienated from his peers. His work from this period displays an array of aesthetic styles and motifs as he searched for the idiom that best expressed his rich inner world. He began work on his Mask series in 1994 in an attempt to exorcise the overpowering sense of isolation he felt. The paintings feature chic figures in expressionless white masks, alluding to the superficial transformation of 1990s China. The environment in which he placed these figures were equally unreal, a reference to the artificiality inherent in a culture attempting to transform its identity. \nThe New Millennium\nThe Mask series propelled Zeng to international stardom and earned him millions of dollars in sales. Since 2000, he has participated in over forty group shows and had solo exhibitions in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Korea, London, Paris and New York. In 2002, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Supper\xe2\x80\x9d sold for over $23 million dollars at an auction, cementing his position as one of the wealthiest artists in Asia. \nHe continues to experiment with different styles, a loose reflection of the development of the Chinese art market. Zeng lives and works out his studio in Beijing.\nTimeline\n1964 - Born in Wuhan, China\n1980 - Dropped out of High school\n1982 - First applied to Hubei Academy of Fine Arts\n1987 - Successfully enrolled at Hubei Academy of Fine Arts\n1991 - Graduated from Hubei Academy of Fine Arts, Oil Painting Department\n1991 - Government assigned work at advertising firm \n1993 - Moved to Beijing to start a career in painting\n1994 - Started working on The Mask series \n1998 - Solo exhibition, \xe2\x80\x9cZeng Fanzhi: Works from 1993-1998\xe2\x80\x9d, at ShanghART Gallery\n2004 - Concluded Mask series\n2008 - Exhibited at Groninger Museum in The Netherlands\n2013 - Last Supper, fetches a recordbreaking price at Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s Hong Kong\n2014 - His \xe2\x80\x9cLouvre Project\xe2\x80\x9d displayed at Louvre Museum\nExhibitions\n2010 - Zeng Fanzhi:The Sublime, Union Temple \n2010 - Zeng Fanzhi, Shanghai Rockbund Art Museum, Shanghai \n2010 - Zeng Fanzhi, The National Gallery of Foreign Art, Sofia, Bulgaria \n2009 - Zeng Fanzhi, Godia Fundation, Barcelona, Spain \n2009 - Art Beijing 2009--Zeng Fanzhi, Art Fairs Agricultural Exhibition Centre of China, Beijing \n2009 - Narcissus looks for Echo, Zeng Fanzhi Suzhou Exhibition, Suzhou Museum, Jiangsu Province \n2009 - Zeng Fanzhi, Acquavella Gallery, New York \n2008 - Tai Ping You Xiang-Zeng Fanzhi solo exhibition, ShanghART Beijing \n2007 - Zeng Fanzhi, Musee d'art Moderne Saint-Etienne Metropole, France \n2007 - Zeng Fanzhi Idealism, National Art Museum, Singapore \n2007 - Zeng Fanzhi 1989-2007, Gallery Hyondai, Seoul, Korea \n2006 - Zeng Fanzhi - Paintings, ShanghART H-Space, Shanghai \n2006 - Hero, Zeng Fanzhi solo exhibition, Art Basel Miami 06, Miami, USA \n2006 - Zeng Fanzhi, Gallery Wedel, London, UK \n2005 - Sky, Fine Art Literature, Wuhan \n2005 - Paintings by Zeng Fanzhi, Hanart T Z Gallery, Hong Kong \n2004 - Unmask the Mask - Zeng Fanzhi, Artside Gallery, Korea \n2004 - Face, Soobin Gallery, Singapore \n2004 - Scapes 1989-2004, the paintings of Zeng Fanzhi, He Xiangning Art Museum, Shenzhen \n2003 - I/We, 1991-2003, The Painting of Zeng Fanzhi, Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai \n2001 - Raw Beneath the Mask, ShanghART Gallery, Shanghai \n1998 - Zeng Fanzhi: The Mask Series, ShanghART Gallery, Shanghai \n1998 - Zeng Fanzhi Works 1993-1998, CIFA (Central Academy of Fine Arts) Gallery, Beijing \n1995 - Behind the Mask, Hanart TZ Gallery, Hong Kon \n1990 - Zeng Fanzhi, Hubei Institute of Fine Arts Gallery, Wuhan\nMuseum / Collection\nThe Saatchi Gallery, London\nAcquavella Galleries, New York\nGagosian Gallery, New York\nMuseed\xe2\x80\x99ArtModerne de la Ville de Paris\nShanghArt Gallery, Shanghai\nWedel Fine Art, London\nKunstmuseum, Bern\nYang Gallery, Singapore\nAura Gallery, Beijing\nKunst Museum, Bonn\nSanta Monica Art Centre\nNational Art Museum of China, Beijing\nBooks / Publications \nChina Art Book.

S" Engine\n3.0 L Twin-Turbo H6\n Power\n Transmission\n7-Speed Manual\n 0-60 Time\n3.9 Seconds\n Top Speed\n193 MPH\n Drivetrain\nRear-Wheel Drive\n Engine Placement\nRear\n Base Price\n$121,750\n As Tested Price\n$128,980\n We spent the past week with a beautiful Carmine Red 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS. The GTS represents a bit of a performance bargain compared to the 911 Carrera S. Options on the Carrera S like the Sport Chrono package, sport seats, and sport exhaust are all standard on the Carrera GTS. Equip the two cars the same and you save about 10 percent by opting for the GTS. Plus you get those cool center-lock wheels from the Turbo. You can't get those on the Carrera or Targa S.\n Our model has just a couple of options, including four-wheel steering and that Carmine Red paint. While the turbos have quieted the exhaust note slightly, the sound itself is as good as ever. Possibly the best bit about this particular car is that the 3.0-liter flat-six sends all 450 horsepower through a seven-speed manual transmission.\nEditor-in-Chief Greg Migliore: There's a scene in a old spy movie where Robert Redford slips on a pair of aviators, gets behind the wheel of an old 911, and pulls out of a parking garage after quitting the CIA. At least on the big screen, it seems like a great release. That's how it feels to drive the 911 GTS. In this age of Demons, AMGs, and awesome power available at almost any price point, it's easy to forget how good the 911 is.\n I found myself staring at its curves and proportions one early morning as I sipped black coffee and watched my dog eat her breakfast. Carmine Red with black wheels is one of the Top 3 ways I'd consider speccing out my 911, if I were ever to get one (I'd keep the black wheels but might opt for gray or green body paint).\n The powertrain is brilliant. It sounds good. It's powerful but not insane. The seven-speed manual is a lot of fun. It's precise and engaging. I didn't need seven gears for suburban cruising, but it's certainly a sophisticated setup. The steering offers a similarly focused vibe. As we've reported, the GTS is a compelling proposition of enthusiasts. You get a lot of stuff you want. I've always leaned toward the 718 Cayman or Boxster models, but I'm really starting to fall for the 911.\nAwesome night in the @Porsche 911 GTS. Seven-speed manual and flat six. #catharsis. pic.twitter.com/WDznWYG2ze\n \xe2\x80\x94 Greg Migliore (@GregMigliore) July 25, 2017 \nSenior Editor, Green John Beltz Synder: When a car has six figures in its MSRP, any fantasy I might have entertained of me owning that car withers and dies. I blow that dream a kiss and move on. No big deal.\n But when I drove the Porsche 911 GTS home this week, I had to mourn the fantasy. Driving this car, I was genuinely heavyhearted to know that I'd never walk into a Porsche dealership and purchase a 911. This moment, enjoying the mechanical precision of the seven-speed manual transmission and feeling the breathy shove of the (flat!) turbo six behind me, was ephemeral. I tried to console myself with an old adage, but got it twisted:\nThe best things in life are ... well, pretty expensive actually. @therealautoblog pic.twitter.com/t5Q967WcLz\n \xe2\x80\x94 John Beltz Snyder (@jbeltzsnyder) July 26, 2017 \n As I darted through traffic, played with the 911's weight around corners, and generally soaked up all the knowledge and feedback this car willingly imparts, I got to thinking: the second-best things in life are usually a lot cheaper.\n A Mazda Miata is much more accessible. That car brings me almost as much joy. It'll never be as special or powerful as a Porsche 911, but it's a pretty distilled driving experience, offering an intimate connection with something balanced and pure. It even has similar bulges on the edges of the hood directing the pilot's gaze forward to the next bend in the road. That always gets me.\n I realize that the 911 starts under $100k (but still out of reach), and that used 911s (and brand new Caymans) are even more affordable. Still, driving this German car reinforces my more realistic urge to own a Japanese car inspired by British ones.\nAssociate Editor Reese Counts: The driving position in this car is damn near perfect. From the steering wheel to the pedal placement to the seven-speed shifter, everything is right where you want it to be. Because everything is where you need it, there's a directness to every action that few cars can match. The shifter moves with precision. The action on the accelerator seems to feed the smallest inputs straight to the rear. The steering is light but always lets you know what the front tires are doing. On a good road, this car is intoxicating.\nOh, I've been itching to get my hands on you. #porsche #porsche911 #911 #911carrera #911carreragts #carminered #manualtransmission\nA post shared by Reese Counts (@rmcounts) on Jul 27, 2017 at 7:37pm PDT\n I can't speak much to the old naturally aspirated flat-six engines of yesteryear, but this 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine is a peach. Torque comes on low and heavy. Revs build to a winding 7,500 crescendo, spitting and cracking as you move up through gears. The engine sounds like a dream, and the not-so-subtle turbo whine reminds you what's cooking out back. Even with the turbos, power is smooth and linear, with just the smallest amount of lag at low revs.\n The more cars I drive, the less I'm concerned about flat-out acceleration and top speed. Yes, there are cars that cost less than half as much that will equal or outperform the 911 Carrera GTS on a track. I don't care. None of them provide the pure, visceral pleasure that this car does. Everything, from the looks to the noise to the way it moves, makes me want more.\n"

S'Old Hollywood Inspired Master Bathroom With Custom Mahogany Cabinets\nWhen renovating a 1920s house steeped in history, where does one begin? Designer Scott Thomas says understanding a space and its needs is step one \xe2\x80\x93 something that can\xe2\x80\x99t be done without getting to know the home and its owners.\nEmpty-nesters Alan and Lisa Stern wanted to update their Paul Revere Williams-designed Los Angeles home. Williams, best known for his work on the L.A. International Airport and Beverly Hills Hotel, designed homes for many famous Hollywood stars, and part of Lisa Stern\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the home was to add some of that old Hollywood glamour to it.\nThe Stern\xe2\x80\x99s home, built in 1929, originally belonged to director and filmmaker Billy Wilder, whose work on films such as Some Like it Hot, The Apartment and Sunset Blvd. also served as inspiration during the remodeling project. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean can you imagine the people who sat at the bar here? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do old Hollywood glamor?\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas recalls.\nAs Art Deco fans, the Sterns wanted to maintain the existing design elements in the architecture while cultivating a clean and luxurious look in every room. Thomas made thoughtful updates while preserving the home\xe2\x80\x99s footprint and character. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it to look like it should have been that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nThat process shines in the master bathroom. From the textured, mirrored wall to the custom mahogany cabinets, every element was crucial to building the old Hollywood feel. A vintage style shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exclude updated necessities, though. Thomas added marble floors and countertops, a walk-in shower with a skylight, and custom wallpaper.\nThomas believes that \xe2\x80\x9csimplicity creates serenity,\xe2\x80\x9d evident in his master bedroom design. Wanting the room to be elegant but appropriate, he applied a hotel-style layout with luxurious accents. The bold curtains, Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s favorite feature in the room, are an elegant way to divide the rooms while adding a sense of drama to the quiet space.\nIn the conservatory, Thomas wanted to keep the look masculine while continuing to honor the home\xe2\x80\x99s history, so he kept the original brick on the side of the house in place. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is supposed to be my version of a man cave,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have some shine, and we have some books and brick, and to me it kind of screams boy time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo re-create the energy and serenity found in the Wilder home and all of Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s projects, the designer suggests focusing on fabrics, colors and quality materials while keeping the style clean and simple. \xe2\x80\x9cYou take the elements. You need patterns and textures and shine,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThrow in one good pattern and use a complementary color scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'Minka Kelly made headlines recently when it was revealed that she has been quietly dating Grey\'s Anatomy star Jesse Williams "for a few months." While 37-year-old Minka, who is most known for her roles on Friday Night Lights and Parenthood, is no stranger to dating high-profile men, her relationship with Jesse garnered attention due to the fact that he may have been married when the two began seeing each other \xe2\x80\x94 Jesse split from his longtime wife, Aryn Drake-Lee, in April and rumors have since swirled that infidelity played a part in their breakup (which Jesse has denied).\nEither way, it certainly seems as though Minka has found love with the actor, who she first met while starring together in The Butler back in 2013. But before Jesse came along, there were a handful of famous suitors who captured Minka\'s heart, including a sitcom star, professional athlete, and Captain America himself.\n 1. Brian White \nMinka dated the Stomp the Yard and Scandal actor from 2003 to 2004.\n 2. Donald Faison \nShe moved on to Scrubs star Donald Faison in 2004, and the two dated for a year.\n 3. Taylor Kitsch \nMinka was linked to her Friday Night Lights costar in 2007, but the romance was never confirmed.\n 4. Chris Evans \nMinka and Chris first struck up a romance in 2007 and suffered a series of breakups and makeups for the next seven years. The last time they were rumored to be back together was in September 2015, after being spotted together over Labor Day Weekend.\n 5. John Mayer \nAfter calling it quits with Jessica Simpson in late 2007, the singer started dating Minka. They split in January 2008, though People reported that they were "still friends" despite the split.\n 6. Topher Grace \nMinka was rumored to have a fling with the That \'70s Show star in 2008.\n 7. Derek Jeter \nOne of Minka\'s most high-profile relationships was with NY Yankees star Derek Jeter, whom she dated from May 2008 to August 2011.\n 8. Ram\xc3\xb3n Rodr\xc3\xadguez \nAfter splitting from Derek Jeter, Minka was rumored to be hooking up with actor Ram\xc3\xb3n Rodr\xc3\xadguez, her costar on the short-lived Charlie\'s Angels TV reboot in 2011.\n 9. Wilmer Valderrama \nMinka dated Wilmer Valderrama in 2012, but the relationship didn\'t last long. Cut to four years later, and the two set off rumors of a reconciliation after being spotted on vacation in Mexico together in September 2016. The getaway came just a few months after Wilmer split from singer Demi Lovato.\n 10. Jake Gyllenhaal \nJake and Minka were reported to have had a fling in 2012 after going on a few dates. According to E! Online, they reconnected two years later. "They hook up whenever they\'re single," a source said.\n 11. Sean Penn \nIn April 2016, Minka and Sean sparked relationship rumors after they were photographed together looking like a couple at a charity dinner in LA. Us Weekly reported that the two "got along great and had a great time" but were just friends.\n 12. Josh Radnor \nMinka quietly dated How I Met Your Mother star Josh Radnor from December 2016 to March 2017.\n 13. Jesse Williams \nMinka is reported to have started dating Grey\'s Anatomy star Jesse Williams in April 2017, around the same time he announced his split from his wife of five years, Aryn Drake-Lee. Jesse and Minka starred together in 2013\'s The Butler and were in Paris in June for a video-game shoot, which was when romance rumors began to swirl. Despite the timing, Jesse has addressed reports of infidelity on his part. In an 11-minute Tidal video, Footnotes for 4:44, for JAY-Z\'s latest album, he says, "I was in a relationship 13 years \xe2\x80\x9413 real years, not five years, not seven years, 13 years. And all of a sudden motherf*ckers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship. Like, the most painful experience I\'ve had in my life \xe2\x80\x94 like with a person I\'ve loved with all of my heart \xe2\x80\x94 that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute." In July, Minka and Jesse were seen catching a movie together in LA.\n'

S" Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) forthcoming monetary policy review next week, RBI Governor Urjit Patel held his customary meeting with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here on Friday, according to official sources.\nA Finance Ministry source here said that following his meeting with Jaitley, Patel also met the new Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.\nThe six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) of the RBI headed by Patel will meet on August 1-2 in Mumbai for the third bi-monthly policy review of the fiscal in the backdrop of latest macro data strengthening the case for an interest rate cut by the central bank.\nRetail inflation in June dropped to a record low of 1.54 per cent, while industrial production data showed that the growth in factory production fell to 1.7 per cent in May, from 8 per cent in the same month a year ago.\nAt its second bi-monthly monetary policy review of the fiscal on June 7, the Reserve Bank of India maintained status quo on its repo, or short-term rate for lending to commercial banks, at 6.25 per cent. In doing so, the policy statement said the six-member MPC was guided by the risks to inflation.\nLast month, Patel told reporters here that the MPC had turned down the Finance Ministry's invite for a discussion ahead of the panel's policy review meeting.\nSince the six-member MPC started setting rates in October last year, this was the first time it did not take a unanimous decision, with five members voting in favour of holding the rate and one opposing.\nThree of the six members of the MPC are government nominees, while the others are from the RBI.\n"

S'Don\'t overlook the big reason behind their incredible success.\nCREDIT: Getty Images\nWhen you look at the most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs, it\'s easy to focus on the outward symbols of their success--acquisitions, IPOs, or titles, for example. Yet it is their internal achievement--the development of a growth mindset--that is really their greatest driver of success.\nOne of the biggest factors for sustainable achievement is a growth mindset that values learning. Icons like Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, Arianna Huffington, and Bill Gates are always finding ways to learn new things and grow as people.\nIt\'s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you don\'t have enough time to learn, but that\'s simply not true. You have the same amount of time in your day as Oprah; you just need to find ways to fit learning into your busy schedule.\nHere are eight easy ways to keep learning and growing, no matter how busy you may be.\nRead books\nThere\'s a reason why Bill Gates, Oprah, and Mark Zuckerberg make reading such a big priority. We are significantly shaped by the stories we read and the information we absorb.\nFind books that feed your curiosities or speak to specific skills. Allow biographies to inspire and novels to spur your imagination. Reading provides new knowledge, fresh perspectives, and a playful imagination that can carry over into all parts of you life. Audiobooks make this easier than ever.\nListen to a podcast\nIt\'s amazing how much you can learn--both in terms of breadth and depth--by listening to a podcast.\nPodcasts are a dream for the busy entrepreneur, as you can listen to them in short sessions when you have 10 or 15 minutes to spare. I always listen to a podcast while I\'m traveling for business--making use of the time that is wasted while waiting at the airport.\nSpend time with different people\nYou should always be meeting others who have skills, knowledge, and experiences that differ from your own. Break away from your industry or CEO groups and start hanging out with high performers in other industries or professions. Interacting with artists and professionals from other industries has been a source of inspiration that broadens my perspective--and it can do the same for you.\nTravel\nYou\'ll learn as much about yourself as you will about others when you take time to travel the world. Exposure to new scenery, cuisines, languages, and cultures forces you to learn new things and observe the way others live.\nYou don\'t need to wait for a vacation to benefit from travel. On your next business trip, make the time to explore a new neighborhood or interact with locals.\nTED Talks\nIn 18 minutes or less, some of the world\'s brightest thinkers share cutting-edge discoveries, innovative research, and inspiring stories. A single TED Talk can forever shape your perspective. Download the TED app to find new talks and save your favorites.\nFind time to think\nA few years ago, I decided to drive in silence instead of listening to a podcast or audiobook. After a few minutes, I experienced multiple epiphanies.\nThat day, I learned that you need to give your brain a break in order to process the information that is constantly coming in. Silence gives you the opportunity to develop original ideas and sort out all of the thoughts jumbled up in your head.\nIgnore the people who tell you to "always be hustling." Find and protect the time you need to reflect and think. Meditating is a great way to do this. Walking, hiking, and spending time in nature are other great ways to experience a more reflective environment.\nWork with a mentor\nNo one has it all figured out, but there are many who can offer you wisdom and advice. Find someone who is further down life\'s path or deeper into his or her career and ask them to share from their knowledge and experience. You\'ll gain confidence and assurance, and learn more than you could on your own.\nLearn a new sport or physical activity\nGet out of your mind and connect with your body by learning a new form of exercise. Not only will physical activity keep you healthy, but the process of learning something from scratch will give you new skills you can take into your work.\nWhen I learned how to box, it gave me a renewed sense of patience and improvisation. It also taught me the balance between offense and defense--which is information I regularly use when negotiating or working with others.\nConclusion\nMany of the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders live with a growth mindset. They view learning as a necessary and regular activity that contributes to their personal growth and professional success. Make learning a constant in your life and adopt some of these recommendations. Growth never becomes obsolete.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

S'State-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has received government approval for acquiring Gujarat State Petroleum Corp\'s (GSPC) entire 80 per cent stake in a Krishna Godavari (KG) basin gas block in the eadtern offshore for Rs 7,738 crore, according to ONGC.\n "Government of India has approved the acquisition of entire 80 per cent participating interest of GSPC along with operatorship rights," ONGC said in notes appended to its results for the first quarter of the current fiscal declared on Thursday. \n In December last, ONGC had agreed to acquire GSPC\'s entire 80 per cent interest, along with operatorship rights, in the Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in Block KG-OSN-2001/3 in the Bay of Bengal for Rs 6,443 crore.\n "A farm-in agreement was signed with GSPC on March 10, 2017 with an economic data of March 31, 2017," ONGC said.\n ONGC will make payments to GSPC "on fulfilment of certain conditions precedent," the filing added.\n ONGC also agreed to pay part consideration of Rs 1,295 crore to GSPC towards acquisition rights for discoveries in the block other than the DDW field. \n Privately-owned Jubilant Offshore Drilling and Geo Global Resources (India) hold 10 per cent stake each in the block.\n According to a company official, GSPC, with a debt of nearly Rs 20,000 crore, has so far made nine gas discoveries in the KG basin block. Of these, three -- KG-08, KG-17, KG-15, known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields, have been approved for development.\n As per the approved field development plan of the DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place was 1.95 trillion cubic feet.\n ONGC on Thursday posted an 8.2 per cent fall in net profit for the first quarter ended June at Rs 3,885 crore, as compared to the Rs 4,233 crore PAT reported in the same quarter of 2016-2017, caused by lower prices for natural gas produced\n'

S'Mercedes-Benz has already launched eight new products in India. Now though, something lot more powerful, a lot greener and a lot meaner is coming to town\nMercedes-Benz is quite on a spree of extending its product portfolio in India with eighth new car launches this year already, including E-Class LWB, S-Class Connoisseur\xe2\x80\x99s Edition, G63 AMG, GLS 63 AMG, GLA facelift and the GLC 43 AMG Coupe. Now though, something lot more powerful, a lot greener and a lot meaner is coming to town. The AMG GT-R is likely to be launched in the country soon and while the date is not confirmed, some images that cropped up on social media suggest that the first unit has arrived in India. The car in the image, posted by AutomobiliArdent: Petrolhead Lifestyle has the signature \xe2\x80\x98Green Hell Magno\xe2\x80\x99 paint job. The AMG GTR is supposedly the first ever Right Hand Drive (RHD) unit to be manufactured at the company\xe2\x80\x99s plant in Affalterbach, Germany.\nFirst unveiled last year at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the AMG GT-R is powered by a twin turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 engine that produces 577 hp and 700 Nm of torque and is paired to a seven-speed dual clutch transmission. It is capable of speeds up to 318 kph and is quick enough to do a 0-100 kph sprint in just 3.6 seconds.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an electronic differential operating on the rear axle to help control all those angry horses. The stability control has three settings, including off! Go ahead, do that if you have the heart and of course, the skills. The traction control has nine levels of intervention, adjusted via a racing car-like knob in the middle of the dashboard.\nThe car has active flaps behind the front fascia and underneath. The flaps were developed on a computer simulation, post which they were tested in a wind tunnel and finally honed on the N\xc3\xbcrburgring. It is this iconic race track which the green hell magno matt paint pays homage to.\n'

S'Consumer behavior studies are embracing virtual reality to decrease costs and boost accuracy. \nLately, we keep hearing about the impact of virtual reality (VR) on shopping and retail. Whether it\'s a VR fashion show or virtual changing rooms, or even the world\'s first virtual reality department store, VR is enjoying a wild ride at the moment.\nBut far less is known about how VR is changing retail shopping behind the scenes. Forward-thinking businesses are using VR today to improve "shopability" and glean insights on shopper behaviors and needs. This kind of data crunching may not be VR\'s most glamorous application, but it\'s certainly proving effective. In fact, 74 percent of retailers say they\'ll lean on VR in the coming years to improve customer experience and gather data. It\'s already clear that there\'s a huge opportunity for businesses to use VR to improve the shopping journey before their customers even reach their store.\nChicago-based VR company InContext Solutions is in the forefront of VR innovators for retail business. Recently closing out a $15.2 million funding round led by Intel Capital and Beringea -- and with a roster of the world\'s largest brands and retailers, including Nestle, Smucker\'s, Kellogg\'s, Anheuser-Busch, and Walgreens -- InContext\'s cloud-based VR software is helping revolutionize the B-to-B retail space. Their enterprise VR software gives retailers and brands the tools they need to evaluate ideas before taking anything to market.\nAs Tracey Wiedmeyer, Chief Technology Officer at InContext explains: "By building hyper-realistic 3D virtual simulations for in-store testing, VR is enabling retailers and brand managers to make faster, smarter and more profitable decisions on how they market both their products and their stores."\nReshaping Market Research\nThe world of retail has always revolved around knowing your shopper. What products are they looking for? What grabs their attention? Traditionally, this type of market research is done through focus groups, purchase intent surveys and shopalongs -- all of which are either time-consuming or don\'t necessarily reflect actual shopper behavior. VR allows retailers and manufacturers to conduct shopping simulations and follow-up surveys to learn behavioral and attitudinal data in near-real time.\n"VR allows retailers and brand managers to test new product assortments, aisle configurations, advertising, and signage. Through virtual shopping exercises, we learn about shopper behaviors and see which concepts will create the greatest engagement," says Wiedmeyer.\nFewer "Hunch-based" Decisions\nWith VR, making decisions on gut instinct alone is a thing of the past. New concepts can be designed, tested and presented in a VR environment before requiring a physical prototype, thereby eliminating a great deal of the financial risk associated with presenting something new.\n"The smartest retailers and brands are using VR to carefully curate their products, researching what will return the most success before placing anything on the shelves," Wiedmeyer explains.\nLarge and small CPG companies alike can benefit from VR\'s ability to move faster and be more affordable than traditional market research methods, giving them the luxury of actually knowing which of their concepts will work before allocating financial and material resources.\nBrand and Retailer Collaboration\nVR streamlines the communication and execution process for rolling out a new store design or product placement by providing a collaborative platform between teams. No wonder that the VR market is projected to reach more than $120B by 2020. Brands and retailers who aren\'t already collaborating via VR should strongly consider the switch, as VR is quickly becoming a vital tool.\n"A category team can ideate the best placement for a new product, and send the concept to the shopper marketing team that can see notes and add relevant signage," says Wiedmeyer, "The entire concept can then be viewed by executives and retail partners who decide what should be tested further. VR eliminates the constant back and forth among specialist teams, and greatly reduces timelines, by streamlining the crucial collaboration process."\nVR is already becoming a crowded space, with over 200 companies valued at $13B participating. VR allows users to create proven solutions while working faster and smarter than ever before. Today\'s forward-thinking retailers are peering through their VR headsets, driving new changes in the way we act as consumers, consider purchases and ultimately, shop.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

S'Luis Dias\nEver since the beginning of Child\xe2\x80\x99s Play India Foundation (www.childsplayindia.org), a music charity working to instil positive values and social empowerment to underprivileged children in India that is now in its seventh year, we are on the radar of young musicians worldwide who want to work in this sector.\nIn December 2015, we were contacted by Abi Heath from England, a member of the Wind-Up Penguin Theatre Company, a children\xe2\x80\x99s musical theatre company, made up of a group of creative people, musicians, singers, actors and technicians from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), London. \xe2\x80\x9cWe come together to create pieces of children\xe2\x80\x99s musical theatre and then take our shows to developing countries, where we perform to children in schools, hospitals, orphanages and slums, or anywhere we can find them! We then work with the children, showing them the instruments and giving them the chance to experience live music, an opportunity many have never had before,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in her email to us. And about a week later I got a supporting email from our friend in London, Goan-origin pianist-pedagogue at Trinity Laban Karl Lutchmayer.\nThus began a chain of correspondence that led to their performing for our Child\xe2\x80\x99s Play children in addition to other locations in Goa in August last year. The quality of their performance was so good that it seemed a shame that more children (and adults!) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the experience. So when the Wind-Up Theatre Company got in touch again this year regarding a return visit, I resolved to have their performance in a more public, larger venue. And so their performance will be at Caritas Conference Hall St Inez on July 31, 2017 at 6 p.m.\nI interviewed Elisabeth Swedlund for this article: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wind-Up Penguin theatre company was founded in 2012 by me and my classmate at the Guildhall School from Romania, Ioana Macovei-Vlascceanu. I\xe2\x80\x99d been running a summer camp for children in a very poor, very isolated village in Romania for the past 5 years, and had always profoundly wished to be able to bring something more artistic to children who lived in places where they have practically no access to culture, art, and multiculturalism \xe2\x80\x93 often in less affluent parts of the world. By fortunate coincidence, Ioana\xe2\x80\x99s parents run a school which is in contact with many charities, and they organised our whole first project \xe2\x80\x93 performing in hospitals, orphanages, and rural schools around Bucharest. The experience was life-changing for the nine students involved \xe2\x80\x93 we went back to Romania (with eight extra Guildhall students, so seventeen of us), the next winter. Our university \xe2\x80\x93 and therefore Penguin \xe2\x80\x93 is very international. During our second project, Bozhana, from Bulgaria, offered to organise a project in Bulgaria \xe2\x80\x93 same with Carlos, our Colombian friend. Once we\xe2\x80\x99d realised it was relatively easy, in this day and age of internet communication, to arrange performances around the world, we started to extrapolate to countries we really wanted to work/perform in. Five years later, after 13 projects, and over 10000 children performed to in more than 150 different places, we\xe2\x80\x99re still going strong!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Wind-Up Penguin theatre company has so far visited Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Lebanon, India, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. They create professional-standard musical theatre performances which they have then taken into refugee camps in Europe resulting from the current crisis in the Middle East, and to hospitals, schools, orphanages and special needs centres in the countries they have visited.\nSwedlund talks in particular about the children in the refugee camps: \xe2\x80\x9cWe very much can tell that the refugee children we perform to have witnessed violence and severe insecurity. They have extraordinarily high energies, and often people who work with them find it difficult to get them to learn, understand, behave. Artistic experiences, I feel, are crucial at this point: in our workshops, we use games and music/singing to channel children\xe2\x80\x99s energy, enabling them to run, shout, play, in a safe space, all through being creative (which they often very much are).\xe2\x80\x9d\nAny experiences that stand out it Swedlund\xe2\x80\x99s memory? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xbave had so many! At the time of this interview, we were performing in Victoria Square, a Square in Athens where many Syrian children play with their parents. A few children ran up to us and asked us about \xe2\x80\x98the boy\xe2\x80\x99 (the puppet we\xe2\x80\x99d been performing with in our previous show). They also remembered ALL of the songs we\xe2\x80\x99d taught them three months ago. It very much reminded me that, what I sometimes feel might be a \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 performance, can inspire children and stay with them, hopefully, in difficult moments.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe troupe also has this endorsement from the Head of Music at the Guildhall School, Jonathan Vaughan: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wind-Up Penguin are a group of highly motivated students who are really interested in charity work. They produce really dazzling and colourful productions to entertain children throughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHow does Wind-Up Penguin choose its members? Swedlund explained \xe2\x80\x9cAs the founder, for me, Penguin combines two equally important aspects: to bring professional-quality music and theatre to children in parts of the world where they don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to art, and to inspire music and drama students to use their skills and training in an altruistic and world-focused way. We specifically advertise our projects to students from the Guildhall School and a few other performance universities of similar high level around London. The project leader (often myself) interviews the members \xe2\x80\x93 we make no distinction artistically, as we know that anyone studying in these universities automatically has a high musical/theatrical level. What we mainly look for is an interest and enthusiasm about discovering the world and helping others through art, and a willingness to work and live alongside a group of other eccentric artists for a couple of weeks!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt their performance tour of India in July-August, last year, in addition to Goa, the Wind-Up theatre company also visited Mumbai, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Tiruvannamalai and Chennai, logging in 31 shows and theatre workshops to over 5000 children.\nSo what will their performance involve? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a cross arts show, incorporating a cappella singing, musicians, comedy theatre, balloons and puppets. It\xe2\x80\x99s very interactive with the kids. All colourful and fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, Penguin is about inspiring artists, who often are on their way to a highly successful career, to perform with an altruistic view on the world. And of course \xe2\x80\x93 for children, through music, theatre, and laughter, to get inspiring, very much out-of-the-ordinary, and hopefully memorable experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d says Swedlund.\n'

S"From Monday to Friday, our hectic daily work schedule does not leave us with any time to pay extra attention to our skin and hair. Now, when the weekend comes, there is some extra time in hand and that can definitely be spent on taking care of the beauty requirements of the body.\nBeauty requirements of the body include taking care of both the hair and skin. It is during the weekends that you can try to do all possible skin and hair beauty treatments, such that by Monday you end up looking fabulous and throughout the week, you don't put on a dull look.\nSo that you can use well all the extra time that you get during the weekend in properly taking care of yourself, here is a list of skin and hair care to-dos that you must try to add in your weekend routine. Doing these skin and hair beauty treatments during the weekend will let you look your best during the entire week. So, go ahead and take a look.\nSkin Exfoliation\nSkin exfoliation is not an everyday activity. Yet, you should be regular in exfoliating your skin. Skin exfoliation takes time and during weekdays, you might not invest so much in doing that. During weekends, how about using the time to exfoliate your skin with a gentle scrubber? You can use mild scrubber from the nearest beauty shop or prepare one homemade scrubber to do this.\nSalon Time\nThe hectic weekdays do not allow us to land up in the salon or spend time there. So, how about booking an appointment during the weekend? Some skin and hair pampering at the salon during the weekend will revitalize you for the coming week. In the salon, you can go for treatments and services, depending on the present condition of your skin and hair.\nHair Massage And Masks\nWeekdays are all about those quick hair wash sessions right before going to work. Your hair needs much more than that. So on the weekend, use the extra time in hand for some good hair massage and follow this by applying a good hair mask. This is not only pampering but it makes your hair ready to bear all the dust and pollution, yet not give up during the week.\nMilk Bath\nHow about a special bath during the weekend? Preparing milk bath is really special during weekends if you have all the right ingredients. Along with milk, you will need some honey, rose petal and Epsom salt. Going for a milk bath is rejuvenating for your entire body. Ensure you let your body enjoy and feel the milk all over and do not rush in that process.\nBody Massage or Spa\nThe constant hecatombs of the week make the body tired and fatigued. Get over the pain, with a body spa or body massage. You can schedule your body spa or massage at the salon. These days, professionals also come home to deliver such services right at your doorstep. Doing this prepares you for the coming week and is also very relaxing.\nNail Care\nNow, during the weekend, when you are spending time on the skin and hair, how about spending some time on your nails as well? Men can clean the nails, trim them, file them and also go for some pedicure and manicure sessions. Along with pedicure and manicure, women can plan a good nail colour or nail art that they can carry all along the week. This will also remove existing dirt and dust on your nails, making it feel clean.\nEye Care\nEyes are indeed soft and a special part of the body. Its beauty routine is very different from all your body parts. Eye care, during the weekend, is especially important for those with dark circles or eye bags. While doing this, ensure you use ophthalmologist-verified products alone.\n"

S'Islamabad: Sixteen people, including women and children, were killed on Sunday when a van caught fire after hitting a gas pipeline in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, officials said. The passenger van was travelling from Rawalpindi to Peshawar when it collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction at Abbottabad chowk and then hit a gas pipeline in the area, The Express Tribune reported, quoting officials.\nThe fire engulfed the vehicle and all the 16 passengers, the report said. The bodies of the victims have been severely burnt and therefore, identification through DNA testing may not be possible, rescue officials said. Police personnel as well as rescue officials arrived at the scene of the incident soon after the blaze was reported and gained control over the fire shortly after.\nThe bodies were then removed from the van and transferred to District Headquarters Hospital Hassan Abdaal. Expressing grief over loss of lives, Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the concerned authorities to submit a report on the incident.\nPakistan has an appalling record of fatal traffic accidents due to poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.\n'

S'Reported by :\nXiaomi\xe2\x80\x99s Redmi range of smartphones has become a de-facto option for most of the users in India. At the start of the year, Xiaomi said that they would launch Mi smartphones in India, along with the Redmi series. And here comes the first Mi smartphone- the Mi Max 2, which is the successor to last year\xe2\x80\x99s Mi Max.\nThe Mi Max 2 comes with a 6.44-inch display; one might wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s going to buy a 6.44-inch smartphone, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bezel-less display. But note this point, Xiaomi has sold over 3 million units of Mi Max since its launch last year, which is the only reason for the company to launch its successor.\nFurthermore, Xiaomi also said that the Mi Max became the best selling smartphone in the 6-inch or bigger display smartphone category. That said, the Mi Max was considered as a larger variant of the Redmi Note 3 because it used the same hardware, camera setup and had a bigger display and battery.\nHowever, the Mi Max 2 is not a bigger variant of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Redmi Note 4. Even though the Mi Max 2 uses the same chipset, the amount of RAM & storage and the device has some unique features of its own. I spent a day with the Xiaomi\xe2\x80\x99s latest phablet, the Mi Max 2. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my account of the same.\nDesign and Display\nOne unique feature of the Mi Max 2 is its design. Xiaomi has changed the entire design language of the Mi Max 2 from the Redmi 4 series. The antenna bands are now present at the top and bottom of the device, same as the Apple iPhone 7 and Oppo R11. Also, the Chinese company launched only the matte black colour option in India, which is a good move because consumers in India went crazy about the matte black versions of the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4.\nThe design is distinct and one thing which I noticed immediately after taking the device into my hands how sleek it is. The Mi Max 2 have a larger battery, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the Xiaomi engineers away from building a slimmer handset. The Mi Max 2 measures just 7.6mm in thickness and weighs 211grams, but the weight is evenly distributed, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel like holding a smartphone of above 200grams.\nThe Mi Max 2 uses the same 6.44-inch Full HD display as the Mi Max, but the brightness levels have increased by a significant margin. This time around, Xiaomi has announced that the display is protected by the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 technology. The screen looked decent in the short time I spent with the device.\nHardware\nAs said earlier, the hardware of the Mi Max 2 is similar to the Redmi Note 4. The device uses the 2.0GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The storage is expandable up to 256GB with the help of a microSD card.\nThe device performed well and was quick in opening the system apps. However, the Snapdragon 625 might struggle with intensive use and the app load time is something the chipset disappointed users in the past. We will test the performance of the phone in coming days and will come out with a full verdict in the review.\nCamera\nAnother aspect where the Mi Max 2 excels is the camera. Xiaomi has used the 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor, same as the Xiaomi Mi 6\xe2\x80\x99s primary sensor. The sensor has an aperture of f/2.2, dual LED flash, and can record 4K videos as well. Here are a few camera samples shot with the Mi Max 2.\nThe disappointing note, however, is that the phone still has a 5MP front-facing camera, which is a bummer.\nBattery\nComing to the battery, the Mi Max 2 has a 5300mAh unit with support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and Parallel Charge technology. Xiaomi claims a complete day battery life with an hour charge or to be precise 68 percent charge with an hour charge.\nAlso, the Mi Max 2 beats the Nokia 3310 in the standby time segment because it is claimed to offer astounding 57 hours of standby time.\nConclusion\nAlmost every brand in India is going after the selfie trend, but Xiaomi is just looking for price-to-specs ratio, and the Mi Max 2 follows the same motto. The 6.44-inch phablet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer a groundbreaking selfie camera, high-end hardware, nor a top-notch display, but it offers insane hardware for the asking price of Rs. 16,999.\nWe will come up with over full review of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 in coming days. Let us know if you want to cover us any specific segment in the device by commenting below.\n'

S'A hand, which could belong to a victim of one of two Air India crashes in 1950 and 1966 in Alpes.\n Evian: \nBody parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said.\nDaniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before,"\nhe told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board.\nAnother Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nRoche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person,"\nsaid Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n"They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\n'

S'The Plant-Based Foods You Should Eat Less'

S'A diet high in processed plant-based foods has been linked to a greater risk of heart disease. \nThis content originally appeared on Health.\nAs a nutritionist, plant-based diets have been one of my areas of specialty for well over a decade. So I am thrilled that more and more people are interested in this way of eating, even on a part-time basis. But I am also concerned about the trend toward highly processed plant-based foods.\nThese are foods that have been stripped of important nutrients, or formulated with unwanted additives. (Think snack chips, sugary cereals, and fake bacon.) They are everywhere, and it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly easy to eat a lot of them\xe2\x80\x94which won\xe2\x80\x99t protect your health, and could actually harm it.\nIn fact, new research suggests that these plant-based junk foods may actually raise a person\xe2\x80\x99s risk of heart disease. The study, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at data from more than 200,000 people to analyze links between diet and heart health.\nThe researchers found that adhering to a plant-based diet was associated with a lower risk of heart disease. But the type of plant foods mattered\xe2\x80\x94a lot.\nWhen the researchers broke down plant-based diets further, they discovered an important difference: While high intake of whole plant-based foods was linked to lower risk of heart disease; a high intake of processed plant-based foods was associated with a higher risk of heart disease. This negative impact was consistent when the researchers controlled for age, sex, BMI, and family history.\nThe takeaway? Quality is king. To protect against heart disease\xe2\x80\x94which is the top killer of both men and women\xe2\x80\x94you should definitely reach for more plant-based foods, but make healthy choices a priority. Here are a few tips to help you do just that:\nRELATED: Top 5 "Healthy" Foods that Have Way More Sugar Than You Thought\nAim For Two Cups of Fresh Fruit a Day\nYou might have one with breakfast, and one as an afternoon snack along with nuts or nut butter.\nTry to Fit in Five Daily Cups of Veggies\nThat should include one cup at breakfast (either whipped into a smoothie, added to an omelet, or just on the side) and two cups at lunch and dinner (in a salad or raw, saut\xc3\xa9ed, oven-roasted, or grilled).\nPick oats, quinoa, or brown and wild rice, for example, over refined grains. And choose portions in line with your body\xe2\x80\x99s need. In other words, don\xe2\x80\x99t overdo it, even on whole grains.\nOpt for More Meatless Meals\nMake pulses (beans, lentils, peas, chickpeas) your protein source.\nChoose Healthy, Plant-based Fats\nThink avocado, extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, and nut and seed butters.\nMaking these nutritious foods the staples of your diet will naturally squeeze out less healthy choices, and up your intake of fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and prebiotics. Even if you choose to include some high quality animal-based foods (like pastured eggs and fish), and splurge once in a while on can\xe2\x80\x99t-live-without treats, making whole plant-based foods the bulk of your diet is the number one key to protecting your ticker.\n'

S'Albert Stumm, CNN \xe2\x80\xa2 Published 26th July 2017\n(CNN) \xe2\x80\x94 Uniform rows of identical white headstones fill the green space in the small yards of mosques and churches throughout Sarajevo, each one bearing a date that seems too recent for a European war. \nOnly a few blocks outside the city center, some buildings are still pockmarked with bullet holes. \nReminders of the war that dissolved Yugoslavia are everywhere, but the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina is due for a fresh look as signs of a vibrant future begin to outshine those of the nearly four-year siege that devastated Sarajevo during the early 1990s. \nNew hotels add a measure of comfort to what has mostly been a backpacker destination, and five airlines announced new services to the city in the last year, including Qatar Airways and the budget carrier Wizz Air.\nNow the enigmatic city exudes a modern cool in numerous ways, such as a sculpture garden skate park in the restored Austro-Hungarian quarter and margaritas served in the preserved Ottoman bazaar within earshot of the Muslim call to prayer.\nTimothy Clancy, an American who came to Bosnia as a volunteer in 1992 and never left, said he\'s spent most of his adult life shining a positive light on a place that most travelers think of as a war-torn wasteland. \n"One advantage is, people have low or no expectations," he says. "And Sarajevo drastically exceeds them every time."\nHere are 11 things to do there: \n1. See the Ottoman bazaar\nThe Ottoman bazaar boasts the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque. \nThe heart of Sarajevo, which was founded by the Ottomans in the 15th century, still lies in the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, a tight quarter of one-story market stalls that date to the city\'s earliest years.\nThe market runs through a few car-free streets along the Miljacka River, leading up the wooden Sebilj fountain in a square teeming with pigeons. \nThroughout the bazaar, exotic aromas of spice markets float among those of sizzling meats, sometimes a whole lamb spit-roasted in full view of passersby. Grizzled men in other stalls use metal tongs to pull searing copper from a fire and then hammer it into intricately designed plates, trays and goblets. \nSome vendors veer closer to kitsch, selling cheap souvenirs and pens made from the shell casings of high-caliber rifles. Others stick with classics such as gooey Turkish delights, their gelatinous cubes redolent of fruit flavors and dusted in flour or coconut.\nThe area also has the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and its lunar clock tower. The Hotel President, which opened in 2015 at the edge of the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, makes a good home base within sniffing distance of the action.\nHotel President, +387 33 575-000, Bazard\xc5\xbeani 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n2. Savor a cultural pick-me-up\nYounger Sarajevans enjoy meeting at hookah bars.\nThere are dozens of places for an espresso or cappuccino in the old town, but it\'s worth searching out Bosnian coffee. \nThick, rich and strong as jet fuel, the local version is such a part of the culture that it\'s the drink of choice for everyone from courting couples to businessmen closing a deal. Visitors to a Bosnian\'s house will have coffee served whether they like or not.\nThe coffee grounds are boiled with water in a long-handled copper pot on top of the stove, which most people associate with Turkish coffee. But the beans are generally roasted in Bosnia for a brew that\'s even more potent. \n"It\'s 10 times better," Clancy says. "Turks are great at tea but not so much at coffee." \nIn the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija, the Male Daire hookah bar, which is another activity enjoyed by younger Sarajevans, is a laid-back place to perk up and meet some friends. Or for a great people-watching corner, there\'s the sidewalk cafe outside Kaffa.\nMale Daire, +387 62 434 384, Luled\xc5\xbeina 6, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nKaffa, +387 33 538-633, Sara\xc4\x8di 70, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n3. Take in a view from above \nWork began in 1729 on five fortifications built onto the old city wall, but the \xc5\xbduta Tabija, or the Yellow Fortress, is basically all that\'s left. It looms above the city from Jekovac Cliff on the eastern end of the old town, offering a fantastic view and a spectacular place to see the sunset. \nThe red roofs and minarets of the old town give way to the neoclassical heft of an Austo-Hungarian expansion during the late 1800s, and eventually to the skyscrapers of the modern city in the distance. All of it is set against a backdrop of thick forested hills that surround Sarajevo. \nA basic cafe opened in the fortress last year, with picnic tables that make the operation resemble a beer garden. Except no alcohol is served, and in the middle of the tables, a red velvet rope circles a cannon that\'s fired at sunset during the holy month of Ramadan. \nDespite a few dry locations, the predominately Muslim city prides itself on its secular attitude, and you\'re much less likely to see a woman covering her hair than one click-clacking down the cobblestones in high heels.\n4. Go on one of the world\'s best hikes \nVia Dinarica is a mega-network of paths that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia.\nAll those hills surrounding Sarajevo lead to the mountains of the Dinaric Alps, which gave the city reason to host the Winter Olympics in 1984. Well-marked hiking trails wind through the woods on all sides of the city, meaning a hiker could walk out its eastern edge, head north and west along a ridge, and end up back on the other side of town that afternoon. \nThose trails also lead to the Via Dinarica, a mega-network of paths inspired by the Appalachian Trail that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia. Along the way are traditional mountain villages and opportunities for rafting, hiking and climbing. \nThe network was named the best new trail of 2014 by Outside magazine and was on National Geographic Traveler\'s list of places to go in 2017. ViaDinarica.com is a comprehensive resource. \n"You can print a miniguide for each section of the trail," says Clancy, who helped stitch the trial network together as an ecotourism consultant for the United Nations. "It\'ll show you where you the water holes are, can give you turn-by-turn directions. It\'s pretty sophisticated."\n5. See where World War I began\nThe Latin Bridge, which crosses the shallow Miljacka River to connect the old town with the Skenderija neighborhood, is the city\'s oldest. But as 16th-century bridges go, the structure itself isn\'t what stands out. \nOn one end of this bridge in 1914, the heir to Hapsburg throne was assassinated by an 18-year-old Serbian, sparking World War I and leading to the extinction of two great empires, the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman. \nA modest museum at the northern end of the bridge tells the story how Gavrip Princip happened to see Archduke Franz Ferdinand\'s motorcade after other would-be assassins failed to kill him. \nThe museum has changed with the evolving perception of Princip, who over the years has been seen as both a nationalist wing nut and a socialist hero. Now the museum focuses on the 40 years Sarajevo was ruled by Austria-Hungary, with particular attention for the end.\nMuseum of Sarajevo 1878-1918, +387 33 533 288, Zelenih beretki 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n6. Dive into the steampunk and skater scene\nToward the west end of town, skateboarders shoot around the ramps at Hastahana Park while families linger on the grassy areas. When the sun starts going down on nice days, it can be a cool scene of young and old mingling together, some hanging out drinking beers while others watch the world go by.\nA gigantic sculpture by German artist Helmut Lutz, which was installed in 2005 next to one of the ramps, dominates the park. It\'s a steampunk mix of steel horns, fabric bellows and fanciful busts that looks like a yacht-sized musical instrument from Dr. Seuss\' Whoville. \nThe sculpture was funded by residents of one of Sarajevo\'s sister cities, the German town of Freiderichschafen. Each winter, the park also hosts a holiday market. \nThe neighborhood around the park exhibits the building boom during a massive expansion of the city during Austrian rule. Another Austrian contribution: the street car, which arrived in Sarajevo in 1885 as a test run for Vienna\'s public transit. \nHastahana Park, Mar\xc5\xa1ala Tita 12, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n7. Hike up to the abandoned Olympic bobsled track\nThe Olympic ruin is now a daredevils\' playground.\nWhen the Olympics came to Sarajevo, the games were hailed as a Cold War success in semi-neutral territory (Yugoslavia was communist but not aligned with the Soviet Union).\nThe war in the 1990s damaged many of the sporting venues, including the bobsled and luge track on Trebevi\xc4\x87 Mountain south of town. Despite some recent efforts to restore the track for training, it\'s basically abandoned and covered in graffiti.\nVideos abound on YouTube of people riding bikes or rollerblades down the track, but it also attracts non-daredevils who hike through thick pine forest on well-marked trails and climb onto the track at various spots along the way. The trailhead is a cheap, 10-minute taxi ride outside the city for a rare opportunity to see a bizarre Olympic ruin. \nThe Pino Nature Hotel, which opened near the top last year with a mid-century-meets-Aspen ski lodge feel, has a spa and a terrace with spectacular views of the mountain. It too, however, is a dry venue, but the restaurant is worth a visit for its hearty, updated Bosnian fare.\nPino Nature Hotel, Trebevi\xc4\x87 - Ravne 1, 71000 Sarajevo, BiH +387 33 257 800\n8. Drink rakija on a night out\nThroughout the Balkans, rakija is a staple served at parties and weddings, with dinner at home, and at most bars as a boost of liquid courage. A clear brandy similar to grappa, it\'s distilled from various fruits, often plum, pear or apple but also from more exotic ingredients such as quince or walnuts. Just don\'t be fooled by the fruit flavors. This is potent stuff.\nBarhana in the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija serves many varieties as well as mezze, or small snacks, and tablets of cured meat and cheese similar to what you\'d find at Spanish tapas bars. All that toasting and tasting leads to some late nights -- some bars in Sarajevo don\'t close until 6 a.m. -- and lots of new friends. \n"Sarajevo is the kind of place where you leave your place with five marks in your pocket, and somehow you come home at 6 a.m. with 10 marks and a full pack of cigarettes," says Cat Norman, who opened the Doctor\'s House Hostel about three years ago. "You\'ll see their generosity knows no limits." \nAnother popular place is Hacienda. What it lacks in Mexican authenticity it makes up for with a lively crowd and surprising margaritas. \nBarhana, +387 33 447-727 \xc4\x90ulagina \xc4\x8dikma 8, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nHacienda, +387 33 441-918, Bazard\xc5\xbeani 3, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nThe Doctor\'s House Hostel, +387 61 222 914, Pehlivanu\xc5\xa1a 67, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n9. Get your kicks at an old porn theater\nA night at Kino Bosna is a singular experience, Norman says. Before the war, it was a movie theater showing Hollywood movies and eventually porn films, but the owner fled and never came back. \nOne of the employees decided to open it as a bar, bringing in wooden chairs and red-checkered tablecloths and leaving up the old film posters.\nThe owner has since become a Sarajevo legend. Because she\'s essentially squatting in her old boss\' business, she can\'t register to pay taxes. "The bar will get closed down for a week here and there, but she always finds a way to reopen it," Norman says. "It\'s what the party people want when you come to the Balkans." \nMonday night is the best of the week, she says. That\'s when they have a lively band playing traditional sevdah music for tips.\nKino Bosna, +387 61 866 946, Alipa\xc5\xa1ina 19, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia-Herzegovina\n10. Glimpse at horrors or war from siege to Srebrenica\nThe tunnel that was a link to the outside world when the city was cut off by Serbian troops.\nAlthough there\'s much more to Sarajevo than war, the city has embraced its tortured past. Serbian troops cut the city off from the outside world, and rooftop snipers fired at anyone walking on the streets. \nThe only lifeline for supplies was an 800-meter tunnel that connected the people with smugglers from outside the city. The War Tunnel Museum has preserved a section of it and tells the tale of the family that risked their lives by allowing the entrance to pop up in their cellar.\nAnother exhibition, the Srebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, focuses on the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust. In one month near the end of the war, Serbian troops slaughtered more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in one town, mostly men but also women and children, and buried the bodies in mass graves. \nA photographer chronicled the lives of the survivors, who more than 20 years later still don\'t have all the answers about what happened to their family members. The black and white photos show the exhumation of graves, some of which had been moved several times to evade human rights inspectors. And hundreds of mothers supplied portraits of their sons who were killed, including some whose bodies were never identified.\nWar Tunnel Museum, +387 33 684-032, Tuneli 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina \nSrebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, +387 33 953 170, Trg Fra Grge Marti\xc4\x87a 2/III ,71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n11. Eat like a Bosnian \n"In Balkan culture, men live with their mother," Norman says. "Then they get married, and the wife does the cooking. Then when the wife dies, they go to an ascinica." \nAscinica means a cafeteria that serves cheap, hearty food, often stews, and everything is served with somun, a type of grilled flatbread similar to pita. One good option is ASD\xc5\xbd. \nBosnians also claim they have the best version of a Balkan staple called \xc4\x8devapi (pronounced chuh-VAH-pee). It\'s grilled links of minced beef or lamb stuffed into somun with onions and sometimes sour cream, and it\'s one of the most satisfying street food meals anywhere. For the most authentic, locals recommend Zeljo or Petica.\nRoast lamb is also serious business, particularly at the fine-dining 4 Sobe Gospodje Safije, which translates to the 4 Rooms of Mrs. Safije. Their take, considered one of the best in the country, is cooked for 20 hours and served with a garlic sauce, pistachio pesto and crushed potatoes.\nASD\xc5\xbd, +387 33 238 500, \xc4\x86ur\xc4\x8diluk mali 3, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\xc5\xbdeljo, +387 33 441-200, Kundurd\xc5\xbeiluk 19, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\xc4\x86evabd\xc5\xbeinica Petica Ferhatovi\xc4\x87, +387 33 537-555, Bravad\xc5\xbeiluk 29, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n4 Sobe Gospodje Safije, Cekalusa 61, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina +387 33 202-745\nBONUS: History and a hike\nThe Sarajevo Free Walking Tour provides an excellent way to get bearings as well a dose of history during two-hour strolls through the city. Guides, who work for tips, are friendly, knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions. It\'s best to make contact a few days in advance. \nAt one point, they\'ll walk you past the Sebilj fountain, the Ba\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dar\xc5\xa1ija\'s most-photographed landmark. Legend has it that if you drink from the fountain, you\'re destined to come back. Chances are, you\'ll want to anyway.\n'

S'Executive Summary\nOne of the most common ways companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results. New research illuminates how diversity training effectiveness can depend on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes. Experiments conducted with college students reveal two promising options: perspective taking (walking a mile in someone\xe2\x80\x99s shoes) and goal setting (for example, setting a goal to speak out the next time you hear someone make a biased comment).\nOne of the most common ways that companies attempt to address organizational diversity is through formal training. Yet research on the effectiveness of such programs has yielded mixed results: Some studies show that diversity training is effective, others show it\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective, and still others show that it may actually lead to backlash. This has led to pessimism regarding diversity training, with some claiming it simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nWe believe that pessimism is premature. For one, a recent meta-analysis of over 40 years of diversity training evaluations showed that diversity training can work, especially when it targets awareness and skill development and occurs over a significant period of time. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there\xe2\x80\x99s a single perfect solution to creating diverse and inclusive organizations. Diversity training effectiveness depends on the specific training method used, the personality characteristics of those who are trained, and the specific outcomes that are measured after training concludes.\nOur research highlights how changing a few aspects of diversity training might actually make a difference, depending on how they\xe2\x80\x99re applied within organizations. While our work takes the form of small-scale experiments with undergraduate students, we believe it has potential to be used smartly inside companies. And since undergraduate students are undoubtedly future employees, we view uncovering what works for this group as a first step in discovering what might work for the broader population of working adults. Additionally, using a population of students affords us a greater degree of experimental control (by incorporating a control condition where no diversity training is received for comparison purposes, comparing the effects of specific training exercises with one another, and measuring multiple outcomes over time), which allows us to uncover truths regarding diversity training effectiveness in a way that may not be as feasible in businesses or other organizations.\nOne training exercise that we analyzed, and that shows promise, is perspective-taking, which is essentially the process of mentally walking in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. Results from our experiment involving 118 undergraduate students showed that taking the perspective of LGBT individuals or racial minorities \xe2\x80\x94 by writing a few sentences imagining the distinct challenges a marginalized minority might face \xe2\x80\x94 can improve pro-diversity attitudes and behavioral intentions toward these groups. These effects persisted even when outcomes were measured eight months after training. Even more exciting is the fact that perspective-taking was shown to be capable of producing crossover effects. In our experiment, taking the perspective of LBGT individuals was shown to be associated with more positive attitudes and behaviors toward racial minorities, and vice versa.\nAnother activity that has empirical support is goal setting. Recent evidence shows that this strategy \xe2\x80\x94 more broadly used to motivate improved aspects of someone\xe2\x80\x99s job performance \xe2\x80\x94 can be successfully adapted by asking diversity training participants to set specific, measurable, and challenging (yet attainable) goals related to diversity in the workplace. For example, a trainee might set a goal to challenge inappropriate comments about marginalized groups when overhearing them in the future (in combination with receiving information about how best to handle such situations). Our experiment with 158 undergraduate students showed that goal setting within diversity training led to more pro-diversity behaviors three months after training and improved pro-diversity attitudes nine months after training. These long-lasting effects are notable, given that diversity training sessions in organizations are usually few and far between.\nBoth of these exercises (perspective-taking and goal setting) produced effects on behavioral outcomes, such as displaying more support and engaging in less mistreatment toward marginalized minorities. These are arguably the most important outcomes, but are often neglected in diversity training research in favor of attitudinal outcomes (the prejudice and bias that one feels toward marginalized groups) and cognitive outcomes (how well-informed someone is regarding stereotypes and biases against marginalized groups).\nOur work also shows that personality characteristics may influence the effectiveness of training, making particular strategies more effective for some employees and less effective for others. For example, perspective-taking may be more effective for individuals who lack empathy than for those who are highly empathetic. We think this is the case because individuals who are high in empathy may be more likely to engage in spontaneous perspective-taking on their own, whereas individuals who are low on this characteristic may need a diversity training activity as a prompt. Similarly, our work (which we presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) has shown that individuals who are high on social dominance orientation \xe2\x80\x94 the degree to which an individual prefers majority groups dominating minorities within a social hierarchy \xe2\x80\x94 tend to be more resistant to diversity training than individuals who are low on this trait. However, there is hope: Having an authority figure endorse the importance of diversity initiatives can enhance the effect of training for these individuals, in effect providing a means to appeal to and reach potentially resistant trainees.\nSo, as you design or tweak your company\xe2\x80\x99s diversity training program, keep these findings in mind. A blanket program will likely be a waste of your time \xe2\x80\x94 and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 time. But by tailoring empirically supported exercises and activities to your goals and your employees\xe2\x80\x99 characteristics, you can make progress in making your organization more welcoming and inclusive.\n'

S' Guwahati, July 27 (IBNS): The Assam government faced a severe fund crunch as several development schemes in the state halted for fund crisis. \n A top source said that, while the current wave flood damaged over 600 numbers roads and bridges across the state, the state finance department hasn\'t released fund to the state Public Works Department to repair the damaging infrastructure.\n "The Public Works Department has requested the finance department to release fund for repairing the damage infrastructure, but the finance department hasn\'t taken any appropriate measures," the top source said.\n Meanwhile, Assam PWD minister Parimal Suklabaidya said that, a total of 504 kms National Highway, 572 numbers state highways, major roads and district roads were damaged in the devastating flood.\n "The flood waters also washed away two bridges, damaging 60 bridges and 86 approach roads in the state," Suklabaidya said.\n The department needs around Rs 300 crore to repair the damaged infrastructure, but the department is facing trouble for fund crisis.\n Union minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday sanctioned Rs 200 crore for immediate repair of national highways ravaged by flood in Assam.\n "But it is not sufficient to repair all damaged infrastructure. The state has over 48,000 km roads and around 36,000 kms are rural roads," the source said.\n Recently, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that, the state has sufficient fund to tackle flood damages and relief.\n "Still around Rs 400 crore are lying in the state coffers," Himanta Biswa Sarma said.\n'

S'New Delhi: The Union Finance Minister, Sh. Arun Jaitley today stated that the opportunities presented by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework and Government\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on resolution represent a unique opportunity for Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) and Private Equity firms (PE). At a meeting today with leading ARCs and PE firms focussed on stressed assets, he said that accounts classified as impaired/stressed still had inherent value. These were essentially productive assets which if turned around would not only create additional jobs but also contribute to national output. For this to happen, timely interventions, transparent price discovery and right management were required.\nSh. Jaitley highlighted the legislative and regulatory changes made over the last 18 months which had created an enabling and supportive operational environment for ARCs and for takeover of stressed assets by PE firms/special situation funds. These, inter alia, include 100% ownership by sponsors, higher ceiling of 100% for FDI in ARCs, pass through status to ARC trusts for income tax, exemption from stamp duty, enabling trading of security receipts etc. He noted that a number of new ARCs have sought and obtained registration during recent months. The increasing number of players in the market was indicative of an increasing interest in the sector but also presented an opportunity for banks to offload stressed assets before fully provisioning for them. The ratio of cost of acquisition to book value of assets acquired by ARCs has been rising. Within this overall context, the ARCs and PE funds were well placed to step up their activity levels as all the building blocks were there.\nDuring discussions, ARCs and PE firms were appreciative of the steps taken so far by the Government and RBI. The need for evolution of targeted case specific solution by ARCs/PE funds was brought out, as these entities have higher operational flexibility. Prospects for capital raising and deployment were highlighted. It was suggested that sale of project loan by a consortium instead of individual banks selling their loan account could be a much more effective way of ensuring debt aggregation in a timely manner. Suggestions were also made regarding increase in activity levels of ARCs and PE funds.\nTaking note of the feedback, Shri Jaitley observed that Govt. and RBI had greatly facilitated the role of ARCs and Special Situation funds in effective resolution. Resultant collaboration between banks, ARCs, PE, Asset Management Companies and resolution professionals could pave the way to a virtuous cycle of fresh investments, new jobs and additional demand.\n'

S'Courtesy of Silversea Cruises\nStepping onboard Silver Muse is like catching a glimpse of the future: The 596-passenger ship, the largest in Silversea\xe2\x80\x99s fleet of ten, is meant to be a preview of vessels to come. Turns out, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stunning future indeed. Swathed in earth tones with occasional hits of soft colors and plenty of rich wood detailing, Silver Muse is a master class in understated luxury. The result is a refined design that feels almost as restful as the sea.\nBut perhaps the biggest change from the previous vessels is the number of restaurants. There are eight of them in all \xe2\x80\x94 a huge number considering the size of the ship \xe2\x80\x94 so passengers on shorter cruises can try a different spot for dinner each night. Spaccanopoli, a casual outdoor pizza restaurant above the pool, is a hit thanks to fresh ingredients and perfect dough; Indochine, a pan-Asian restaurant inspired by Marco Polo\xe2\x80\x99s travels, thankfully doesn\xe2\x80\x99t skimp on the spice; and Atlantide, a grand formal seafood restaurant, also has plenty for meat lovers and vegetarians to love.\nAnd then there are the little things Silversea does so well: welcome champagne, speedy internet, and 24-7 butler service that manages to be both attentive and unobtrusive. It all adds up to a next-level experience at sea.\nTravel + Leisure was recently invited as a guest by Silversea to sail from Marseilles to Palma de Mallorca on Silver Muse. Here are a few of our favorite things we experienced on the ship.\n'

S'A kaleidoscopic vision of the city through nine stories by various writers and artists\n  Eighteen artists and writers from the city have collaborated to come out with a graphic novel that is a tribute of sorts to the city of Bengaluru. Through nine illustrated stories conceptualized by a mix of established artists as well those just breaking into the field, the anthology portrays a vision that melds past, present and future of the city in their signature styles. \n  Speaking about the novel, Jai Undurti, creative director of a graphic novel publishing house, says, "The novel is the second part of our Every City Is A Story series, in which we try to capture the essence of a region through graphic art. The idea for Bengaluru came after our first for Hyderabad in 2014 became a hit, and we invited various artists across the city to send in their ideas. While the e-book version of this novel was released in February earlier this year, owing to a lot of request for it to be an actual book, we\'ve also brought out the hard-copy version." \n  The stories range from a variety of topics. One imagines Bengaluru 20 years from now, while another looks back at the city that was. The other elements include a fictional occult \'origin\' story, ATM theft, and more. \n  Speaking about the experience, Sreejita Biswas, who goes by the name Solo and has written the story about a vigilante operating from the roofs of Bengaluru, says, "Ojo, my junior from college, and I have been working together for a while now, coming up with graphic comics every Sunday for our webzine, which have even been published in Japan. In that respect, this has been an extension of the work we have been doing. It has been quite interesting to have contributed to a novel that is a tribute to this beautiful city." \n  Artist Appupen, whose story is the first in the novel, says, "A book of this sort has never been done for Bengaluru before. I hope people do not consider this as just a comic book for light reading, and instead spend a little more time exploring the finer aspects of our drawing and stories. A lot of thought has been put into the stories in this book, and fully experiencing will make you appreciate both the artists and the city better." \n'

"He was freaking out in the office for a little while and then he just vaporizes. He just disappeared," King said.\nAfter searching the city for their "tour manager," the band had to move on to Rotterdam \xe2\x80\x93 the next stop on their tour \xe2\x80\x93 where they found him sitting outside the venue waiting for them. Araya later shared "a drinking story" from a tour stop in Montreal.\nSlayer are in the midst of a summer tour with Lamb of God.\n'

S'Entering its eighth generation, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom exudes the same sense of tradition and formidability as its predecessors. But it looks like Rolls was also going for something more powerful, more artistic, and dare we say, more modern.\n"The need to modernize the Phantom was absolutely clear for us," Rolls-Royce design boss Giles Taylor said at a reveal event. "We wanted to give this car a little more energy."\nTo that end, the flagship receives evolutionary design updates while staying true to its 92-year history. Rolls raised the grille higher and integrated it into new protruding lines that run across the hood. Making its presence known, the Spirit of Ecstasy sits about half an inch higher, and the headlamps feature a new square-shaped lighting graphic. New lines across the side give the bodywork a more fluid look. The top line begins at the hood and ends just above the door handles, while another fades from in front of the front wheel to just before the back wheel. In the rear, the Phantom reveals its new sloped, coupelike roof and a larger license plate holder. The rectangular taillight graphic nicely complements the lights up front, and 22-inch wheels complete the design.\nUnder that restyled hood sits a brand-new 6.75-liter V-12 engine with two turbochargers. The engine produces 563 hp, up from 453 hp produced by the naturally aspirated V-12 on the previous Phantom. Torque is 664 lb-ft, instead of 531 lb-ft on the old model. Power is routed through a ZF eight-speed automatic. Accelerating to 62 mph from a standstill takes 5.3 seconds in the short-wheelbase version and 5.4 seconds in the longer model, which weighs a whopping 5,948 pounds unladen.\nEven more important, the Phantom sits on a new architecture that will eventually underpin every Rolls-Royce model. That includes the upcoming Project Cullinan "high-sided, all-terrain motor car" as well as the next Ghost, Wraith, Dawn, and future coachbuild projects. Rolls says the all-aluminum spaceframe architecture is about 30 percent more rigid than the Phantom\'s old platform, and it can accommodate different types of propulsion and the different weight requirements of future new models. The new architecture helps keep weight down and should improve ride comfort, Rolls says.\nAlso promising increased ride comfort, the new Phantom features the latest-gen air suspension, four-wheel steering, and a new double-wishbone front axle and five-link rear axle. The Phantom is said to be 10 percent quieter than its predecessor while traveling at 62 mph, thanks to better insulation in the form of a new sound absorbing headliner, silent-seal tires with a foam layer placed inside the tire to prevent tire cavity noise, a two-layer glazing around the car, and what Rolls calls the largest ever cast aluminum joints in a body-in-white. Rolls said that after running road and vibration tests on the new Phantom, an acoustics engineer had to check whether the instruments were working correctly because the sound levels were so low.\nEveryone assumes the Phantom customer is the passenger rather than the driver. For the chauffeur, closing the doors after letting in a passenger requires a simple tap of a sensor on the exterior door handle. For the convenience of the passenger, the front and rear doors now close from the inside with the push of a button.\nOnce inside the cabin, the first thing you\'ll likely notice is the new Gallery, which includes customized artwork set underneath a piece of glass that covers the full width of the dashboard. The best part is you can put in any kind of artwork you\'d like. Rolls has already created examples of such art, everything from oil paintings, a collection of porcelain roses, an abstract design crafted from silk, and even a gold-plated 3-D-printed map of an owner\'s DNA. "I wanted to take the motoring constant that has existed for a century but served little purpose but to hide airbags and componentry, and give it another purpose, space to breathe," Taylor said in a statement.\nThe overall look is an improvement from the dash area of the previous Phantom, which was starting to grow a bit dated because of the physical gauges on the instrument cluster. Now, the instruments are digital and are set off by round chrome surrounds.\nThe new Phantom continues with the tradition of offering the Starlight Headliner, and the new one is the largest ever on a Rolls. Along with the softest carpet you can likely imagine (trust us), the Phantom offers customers a choice of different seat types, including lounge seats and a sleeping seat. In the rear, a center console comes complete with whisky glasses and decanter, champagne flutes, and a Coolbox. You\'ll also find rear picnic tables and monitors that can be put up and down with the push of a button. Rather than just offering heated seats, Rolls-Royce includes heating for the front door armrests, rear side armrests and rear center armrest, front center console lid, and the lower C-Pillar. And whether you\'re the driver or the passenger, you\'ll be comforted by safety features including collision warning, cross-traffic warning, a head-up display, active cruise control, lane departure and lane change warning, and a host of other aids.\nWith an even nicer interior and more powerful engine befitting its large size, the Phantom achieves a more modern feel than the seventh generation that made its debut back in 2003. But the goal is still the same: offer the smoothest, most accommodating means of conveyance in the world\n'

S'The flood situation improved marginally in West Bengal today even as three more persons died in the past 24 hours taking the toll to thirty-one, an official said. \n With the weather condition improving slightly and the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) releasing less water, the situation in 11 flood-hit districts of the state slightly improved, he said. \n At the moment over 23 lakh people have been hit in over 165 villages inundated by heavy rains and the water released by the DVC, he said. \n Around 2067 relief camps have been opened in flood-hit districts of the state where close to 45,000 people have taken shelter. \n Meanwhile, an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter this morning rescued nine members of a family from a house in West Midnapore district\'s Ghatal area. \n Nine people, including a man, three women and five children, of the same family have been winched to safety from a submerged house in Ghatal, an IAF official said. \n In fact, one IAF helicopter distributed 500 kgs of relief materials including medicines, food and water pouches in the flood-hit areas of the state. \n "There are a few more members who are still there at the house in Ghatal. They were reluctant to leave their house ... We can understand their sentiment. We\'ll again request the IAF helicopter to pursue them and rescue them," he said. \n The flood situation in Ghatal had worsened, another official at the state secretariat said on the condition of anonymity. \n The state government is yet to estimate the loss incurred by the farmers as over 2.5 lakh hectares of agricultural land were submerged, sources said.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S"Want lean, powerful muscle like the world's best cyclists? Then you may be best ditching the sweat-pouring HIIT routines.\n Why hog five pieces of kit when you can work your whole body with one? \nInstead, consider partnering your heavier lifts \xe2\x80\x94 like Hoy-approved squats and gruelling deadlifts \xe2\x80\x94 with more informed, precise movements. One piece of kit that can help with this \xe2\x80\x94 that supercharges your fitness levels and stability, too \xe2\x80\x94 is the TRX suspension system.\nA study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research compared and examined TRX exercises against more conventional versions of the exercise. The results showed that the TRX suspension system clearly outperformed the traditional variations. Which makes all those crunches look a little silly. \nAfter all, why hog five pieces of kit when you can work your whole body with one? Here, TRX Training Senior Master Trainer Matt Gleed takes you through six exercises that are designed to strengthen your core, build explosive power and prime your legs for faster, stronger and more efficient training. \n1. TRX Body Saw\nStrap Adjustment: Mid-Calf\nHow to do it: \n1. Start facing away from the anchor point, with feet directly under the anchor.\n2. Starting with a strong plank on your forearms and elbows, extend the legs back and up from the resting position.\n3. Drive head back towards anchor point with straight body, and then bring head out in front of your hands maintaining tight plank.\nCommon fault: Hips drop \nFix: Maintain body alignment and keep shoulders pulled back and down through the movement.\n2. TRX Cycle Jump\nStrap Adjustment: Medium\nHow to do it:\n1. Stand facing anchor, keep elbows and shoulders and palms facing each other.\n2. Lunge back, keep front knee over ankle and drop back knee straight down.\n3. Drive up through the front heel into a jump, performing split squats, alternating lunging leg each jump.\nCommon fault: Back leg straight\nFix: Drop back knee\n Common fault: leaning back with weight in back foot. \nFix: Drive up through the front heel.\n3. TRX Forearm Plank with Knee Drive\nStrap Adjustment: Mid-Calf\nHow to do it:\n1. Facing the anchor point, place the forearms into the lower straps underneath the handles, elbow should be directly below the shoulder.\n2. Lift off the knees, extend legs into a plank position.\n3. Drive knee into chest and alternate. \nCommon fault: Hips drop\nFix: Maintain alignment, back straight and hips lifted slightly\n4. TRX Leg Extension\nStrap Adjustment: Mid-Calf\nHow to do it:\n1. One foot in the cradles, kneeling away from the anchor point, with hands under the shoulders.\n2. Extend both legs up into a full press-up position.\n3. Bring the foot in the cradles towards the chest maintaining the free foot extended, allow the hips to lift as the knee comes forward.\nCommon fault: Dropping of the hips\nFix: Maintain a 90 degree angle at the hip while extending and flexing the knee.\n5. TRX Single Leg Squat\nStrap adjustment: Medium\nHow to do it:\n1. Stand facing the anchor, keep elbows under shoulders and palms facing each other.\n2. Centre working leg to anchor point and extend opposite leg in front.\n3. Drop tailbone towards the floor and drive up through the heel.\nCommon fault: Bending too far forward at waist.\nFix: Keep chest lifted.\n Common fault: Weight too far forward or back. \nFix: Keep weight in heels.\n6. TRX Single Leg Superman\nStrap Adjustment: Mid-Calf\nHow to do it:\n1. Stand facing away from the anchor point while holding the handles next to your shoulders, set an angle to roughly 45-degrees to allow you to squat down with your weight on the balls of your feet.\n2. Lift one leg up off the floor and drive up reaching your arms up into an extended position.\n3.

S'(Representational Image)\nKochi: The Kerala High Court on Friday denied permission to a 12-year-old rape survivor to abort her 28-week fetus, after a medical report said it could cause her "permanent" damage.\nA division bench declined to grant permission after considering a report from the government-run TD Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, which said medical termination of pregnancy could result in the girl suffering permanent damage, affecting her future life.\nThe court said it "cannot now accede to grant the relief in relation to medical termination of pregnancy."\nConsidering the growth of the fetus, the medical board\'s opinion was that termination of pregnancy at this stage would be more hazardous than going through a term delivery.\nIn its July 17 order, the court said the report clearly stated that the girl is a well grown healthy adolescent girl.\nThe bench said it would be the state\'s obligation to ensure that the baby and the mother, who herself is a child, are sufficiently provided for and looked after, which shall include educating the mother child so as to enable her to get employment.\nThe Child Welfare Committee should also ensure that she gets her due share under the state government\'s Victim Compensation Scheme. It said the amount so received will be kept in fixed deposit as the victim is minor and the interest therefrom shall only be used for her benefit till she attains majority.\nThe court also directed the Child Welfare Committee, Kakkanad, to coordinate these matters and said "their responsibility would be full and complete in this regard."\nThe girl, raped by her kin, who is also a minor, is currently staying at a special care home here.\nThe case was reported from a village near here a few months ago.\nThe boy was booked for rape under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.\n'

S'The vast underwater \'lost continent\' of Zealandia extends from New Zealand north to New Caledonia and west towards the east coast of Australia\nScientists are attempting to unlock the secrets of the "lost continent" of Zealandia, setting sail Friday to investigate the huge underwater landmass east of Australia that has never been properly studied. \nZealandia, which is mostly submerged beneath the South Pacific, was once part of the Gondwana super-continent but broke away some 75 million years ago.\nIn a paper published in the Geological Society of America\'s Journal GSA Today in February, researchers made the case that it should be considered a new continent.\nThey said it was a distinct geological entity that met all the criteria applied to Earth\'s other continents, including elevation above the surrounding area, distinctive geology, a well-defined area and a crust much thicker than that found on the ocean floor.\nCovering five million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles), it extends from south of New Zealand northward to New Caledonia and west to the Kenn Plateau off Australia\'s east.\nDrill ship Joides Resolution will recover sediments and rocks lying deep beneath the sea bed in a bid to discover how the region has behaved over the past tens of millions of years.\nThe recovered cores will be studied onboard, allowing scientists to address issues such as oceanographic history, extreme climates, sub-seafloor life, plate tectonics and earthquake-generating zones.\nMap showing the Zealandia \'new continent\', a massive underwater landmass in the South Pacific that has never been properly studied.\nCo-chief scientist Jerry Dickens, from Rice University in Texas, said the region was a vital area to study changes in global climate.\n"As Australia moved north and the Tasman Sea developed, global circulation patterns changed and water depths over Zealandia fluctuated," he said.\n"This region was important in influencing global changes."\nAustralian National University\'s Neville Exon said the two-month expedition, setting out Friday from Townsville, would also help better understand major changes in the global tectonic configuration that started about 53 million years ago.\nThis is around the time that the Pacific "Ring of Fire", a hotspot for volcanoes and earthquakes, came into existence.\nIn the February scientific paper, lead author Nick Mortimer said experts had been gathering data to make the case for Zealandia being a continent for more than 20 years.\nBut their efforts had been frustrated because most of it was hidden beneath the waves.\n"If we could pull the plug on the oceans, it would be clear to everybody that we have mountain chains and a big, high-standing continent," he said at the time. \n'

S'The warning was issued on the occasion of Global Tiger Day on Saturday by TRAFFIC \xe2\x80\x94 global wildlife trade monitoring network and WWF \xe2\x80\x94 the leading organization in wildlife conservation and endangered species.\nKochi: The tiger population in Asian forests are not facing grave threat from roaring guns but from deadly snare traps, warn world conservation organisations and urged tiger range governments to crack down on a severe wildlife snaring crisis that gripped forests across the continent.\nThe warning was issued on the occasion of Global Tiger Day on Saturday by TRAFFIC \xe2\x80\x94 global wildlife trade monitoring network and WWF \xe2\x80\x94 the leading organization in wildlife conservation and endangered species.\n"Of particular concern is the threat indiscriminate snares pose to the world\'s remaining wild tigers, which number in the region of 3,900," say the agencies in an article posted on TRAFFIC website. India is home to more than 70 per cent of tigers in the world.\nIndia\'s tiger population grew to 2,226 in 2014 from a dwindling number of 1,411 in 2006. Easy to make from widely available material such as bicycle cable wires and quick to set up, wire snares are deadly traps that are fast becoming the plague of Asia\'s forests, the agencies claim in the article.\nDriven by the growing illegal wildlife trade and demand for illegal wildlife products across Asia, poachers are increasingly using snares to trap wild tigers, elephants, leopards and other wildlife, it says.\nOver 30,000 snares were confisctaed in Cambodia last year alone, it is likely that many more remain undiscovered.\n"Snares are a commonly-used method of Tiger poaching in Asia\'s forests. They are especially dangerous because they kill at random \xe2\x80\x93 so all manner of wildlife is at risk. It is imperative that Tiger range countries scale up their enforcement efforts to curb this crisis," says Richard Thomas, TRAFFIC\'s Global Communications Co-ordinator.\nAs snares can maim or kill any animal that activates them wild Tigers are dealt a double blow, as the prey base they need to survive and reproduce are reduced also.\n"It\'s impossible to know how many snares are being set up every day, and threatening wildlife in these critical habitats. Hundreds of thousands of deadly snares are removed by rangers from Asia\'s protected areas annually, but this is just the tip of the iceberg," says Rohit Singh, wildlife law enforcement expert at WWF.\nWithin the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the only place on Earth where wild Tigers, orangutans, elephants and rhinos are found in the same habitat, snare traps are estimated to have doubled between 2006 and 2014, say the agencies.\n"Removing these silent traps is not enough.Rangers on the ground must be supported by greater resources and strong legislation to take action against illegal poachers with snares," Singh says. \xe2\x80\x94 (PTI)\n'

S"DT Franco Rajender Dev, general secretary of the All India Bank Officers Confederation\n PATIALA: The bankers have decided to go on a nationwide strike on August 22 in protest against the recent initiative taken by the union government to alert the functioning of the banking sector. \n DT Franco Rajender Dev, the general secretary of the All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC), said the initiatives taken by the government would dismantle Public Sector Units. A number of legislative moves initiated in Parliament was against the interest of the common man, he said. \n  He said over one million bankers under the banner of the United Forum of Bank Unions would participate in the strike and would also analyse the much-hyped Gyan Sangam conclave attended by the Prime Minister, the finance minister and all the executives of the banks, wherein, the government laid out a road map on several policies. \n Franco was in the city along with Y.Sudarshan, the general secretary of All India State Bank Officers Federation, to attend a mammoth zonal meeting of the State Bank of India Officers' Association after the merger of State Bank of Patiala with the State Bank of India. He said the bankers would discuss the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the FRDI Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill amendments to BR Act \n He said while the bank's NPA had crossed Rs 7 Lakh crore mark, the government had not taken any proactive stand to give more powers to the banks to recover their money. \n He said the bankers were also concerned about the growing unemployment, farmers' suicide and lay off in IT sector which was signs of a weakening economy due to wrong policies. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n"

S'Ukrainian pilots flying an airplane of the Turkish company Atlasglobal managed to safely land the machine despite being "blinded" by the smashed cockpit.\nOn July 27, the plane with 127 passengers on board was flying en route Istanbul-Erkan when it was hit by a storm at an altitude of 1,200 meters.\nThe storm severely damaged the cockpit and the pilots who decided to return to Istanbul had to land the plane blind.\nThe video released online shows the landing of the aircraft. On the video, the Ataturk airport\'s employees shout: "It won\'t be able to land, it won\'t land," but the plane landed safely.\nThe hero who saved the lives of the passengers was Ukrainian pilot Alexander Akopov who has 30 years of flying experience.\nThis was reported by engineer-pilot Oleg Lungul on Facebook.\n"Hello everyone, yesterday in Istanbul there was a hurricane and a hail the size of a chicken egg. The plane of the Turkish company Atlasglobal, navigated by Ukrainian pilots, was hit by the hail which completely destroyed the cockpit and damaged the front windows. The Ukrainian crew and two Turkish stewardesses showed courage during the incident," Lungul wrote.\nAccording to him, the captain had to land almost blind, heeling over and controlling the process only through the window without opening it. When he landed the plane, everyone in Ataturk airport applauded. The pilots of other planes greeted the plane by flashing lights and came aboard to shake the pilots\' hands.\n"All Turkish channels showed the landing and when the guys came to the hotel, we all and the hotel staff came out and applauded them. It\'s really worthy of respect," Lungul noted in his publication.\n'

S'Dhaka: The World Bank has approved a total of $570 million for two projects in Bangladesh to improve health, nutrition, and population services and strengthen the country\'s public procurement. "The World Bank and the (Bangladesh) government have been working together for years to improve the health sector and public procurement performance," Qimiao Fan, World Bank\n director for Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal said in a statement.\n"The $515 million Health Sector Support Project will strengthen the country\'s health system and improve quality and coverage of essential service delivery, with a focus on the Sylhet and Chittagong divisions, where key health indicators are below national average," he said in the statement.\nWorld Bank. Reuters\n"It aims to increase the number of mothers receiving quality delivery care in public health facilities to at least 146,000 annually in Sylhet and Chittagong divisions. It will also provide basic immunisation to nearly 5 million children," Fan said.\nAs Bangladesh experiences demographic changes, the project will help address emerging health challenges, such as non-communicable diseases. In Sylhet and Chittagong divisions, it will support school-based adolescent health and nutrition services, the statement said.\nThe project will also help improve Bangladesh\'s financial management and procurement in the sector and develop a robust health information system. It will enable over 7,000 community clinics to provide complete essential data on service delivery, and ensure at least 150 health facilities to each have two accredited midwives on staff.\nThe financing will contribute to the government\'s $14.7 billion health sector program between 2017 and 2022. It includes a $15 million grant from the Global Financing Facility to improve service delivery for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition.\nThe other financing approved, the $55 million Digitising Implementation Monitoring and Public Procurement Project, will help Bangladesh improve public procurement performance, including its capacity to monitor implementation of development projects and programmes using digital technology, the World Bank statement said.\nAccording to concerned officials, Bangladesh spends over $7 billion yearly on public procurement, which constitutes about 70 percent of the annual development programme.\nThe World Bank helped Bangladesh roll out electronic procurement (e-GP) in four key public procuring entities in 2011, and establish a high capacity data centre in 2016 to accommodate increasing demand for electronic procurement. The new project will expand e-GP to all 1300 government procuring organisations, the statement said.\nThe project will help the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division effectively monitor the execution of annual development programs by establishing a single online platform connecting all public sector organisations.\n'

S'Heavy rainfall and water released from the Jawai Dam have flooded parts of Jalore and neighbouring areas in Rajasthan, officials said today. \n More than 70,000 cusec of water were released from the dam - the largest in western Rajasthan - yesterday evening. \n Heavy downpour also affected normal life in the adjoining Pali and Sirohi districts, where many villages are on high alert and relief and rescue operations are carrying on. \n Three gates of the dam were opened on Thursday and eight more were opened last night, after the level of water rose above 60 feet. \n "Of the total 13 gates, 11 were opened last night to discharge water. Seven gates were closed in the morning and four are still open," said Vinod Kumar Malhotra, sub- divisional magistrate (SDM) of Sumerpur town in Pali district. \n The water level in the dam was 59 feet at present. \n "Many villages in Jalore are flooded, and some roads have been washed away. Relief work is underway," L N Soni, the Collector of Jalore, said. \n Soni said the district administrations in Pali and Jalore had alerted villagers before the gates were opened. \n "People in several hundred villages in Pali, Sirohi and Jalore had been affected by the flood-like situation," the district collector said. \n In many villages, people were being rescued from their rooftops by the Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), he added. \n "Rescue operations are being carried out," Hemant Gera, Secretary of state Disaster Management and Relief department said. \n Various parts of Rajasthan have been experiencing heavy rainfall. \n Chittoragarh recorded a maximum of 129 millimetres till this morning, followed by Rawatbhata, which received 104.9 mm of rain, followed by Mount Abu, which recorded 101 mm of rain. \nBhilwara, Ajmer, Dabok, Kota and Bundi received 65.2, 54.6, 49, 21 and 20 mm of rain respectively, while many other areas recorded below 20 mm rains during this period.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S"Scientists added two genes to the plant's genome to get the new hue\nRoses are red, but science could someday turn them blue. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the possible future applications of a technique researchers have used to genetically engineer blue chrysanthemums for the first time.\nChyrsanthemums come in an array of colours, including pink, yellow and red. But all it took to engineer the truly blue hue\xe2\x80\x94and not a violet or bluish colour\xe2\x80\x94was tinkering with two genes, scientists report in a study published on July 26 in Science Advances. The team says that the approach could be applied to other commercially important flowers, including carnations and lilies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsumers love novelty,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nick Albert, a plant biologist at the New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research in Palmerston North, New Zealand. And \xe2\x80\x9cpeople actively seek out plants with blue flowers to fill their gardens\xe2\x80\x9d.\nPlenty of flowers are bluish, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rare to find true blue in nature, says Naonobu Noda, a plant researcher at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization near Tsukuba, Japan, and lead study author. Scientists, including Noda, have tried to artificially produce blue blooms for years: efforts that have often produced violet or bluish hues in flowers such as roses and carnations. Part of the problem is that naturally blue blossoming plants aren\xe2\x80\x99t closely related enough to commercially important flowers for traditional methods\xe2\x80\x94including selective breeding\xe2\x80\x94to work.\nMost truly blue blossoms overexpress genes that trigger the production of pigments called delphinidin-based anthocyanins. The trick to getting blue flowers in species that aren\xe2\x80\x99t naturally that colour is inserting the right combination of genes into their genomes. Noda came close in a 2013 study when he and his colleagues found that adding a gene from a naturally blue Canterbury bells flower (Campanula medium) into the DNA of chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum morifolium) produced a violet-hued bloom.\nGetting the blues\nNoda says he and his team expected that they would need to manipulate many more genes to get the blue chrysanthemum they produced in their latest study. But to their surprise, adding only one more borrowed gene from the naturally blue butterfly pea plant (Clitoria ternatea) was enough.\nAnthocyanins can turn petals red, violet or blue, depending on the pigment\xe2\x80\x99s structure. Noda and his colleagues found that genes from the Canterbury bells and butterfly pea altered the molecular structure of the anthocyanin in the chrysanthemum. When the modified pigments interacted with compounds called flavone glucosides, the resulting chrysanthemum flowers were blue. The team tested the wavelengths given off by their blossoms in several ways to ensure that the flowers were truly blue.\nThe quest for blue blooms wouldn't only be applicable to the commercial flower market. Studying how these pigments work could also lead to the sustainable manufacture of artificial pigments, says Silvia Vignolini, a physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK, who has studied the molecular structure of the intensely blue marble berry.\nRegardless, producing truly blue flowers \xe2\x80\x9cis a great achievement and demonstrates that the underlying chemistry required to achieve 'blue' is complex and remains to be fully understood\xe2\x80\x9d, says Albert.\n"

S'Virat Kohli hit his 17th Test century as India are in a commanding position against Sri Lanka in the first Test at Galle.\nVirat Kohli celebrates after scoring his 17th Test century during the fourth day of the first test match between India and Sri Lanka. (AP)\nIndia captain Virat Kohli smashed his 17th hundred in the second innings of the opening Test against Sri Lanka at the Glale Interntational Stadium.\nResuming the day on 76 runs, Kohli kept on punching for singles and doubles and then latched on a Dilruwan Perera delivery to clobber over midwicket for six to move to 89. \nHe completed his hundred with a single to midwicket, reaching the landmark in 133 balls, five fours and one six. He had helped India reach 233 for four with the three-figure mark.\nThe hundred was important to release the pressure on the captain. It is his first Test after the below-par series against Australia at home and the coach-controversy where he received flak for going against the successful Anil Kumble and getting his preferred candidate, Ravi Shastri, in. It is natural to feel the pressure and the critics were waiting for signs of it. \nTo add to it, he had failed in the first innings. But, when he walked out to bat after the 86-minute stoppage caused by a thundershower in the afternoon session, Kohli dispelled all doubts. He began with a four and continued to play delightful strokes all around the ground.\n Earlier, during his innings he had completed 1000 runs as India captain in away Tests. India declared at 240-3, setting Sri Lanka a target of 550 runs to win.  \n'

S"Einstein's theory of special relativity sets of the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second (300 million meters per second). But some scientists are exploring the possibility that this cosmic speed limit changes.\n In 2015, a team of Scottish scientists announced they had found a way to slow the speed of light. By sending photons through a special mask, the researchers altered their shape. In this malformed state, these infinitesimal particles of light traveled slower than normal photons.\n The difference in speed was almost imperceptible, but the accomplishment itself was stunning! At 299,792,458 meters per second, the speed of light has stood as an unbreakable, unchangeable speed limit. No longer.\n But why would anybody want to slow down the speed of light? After all, it's already slow enough!\n As strange as that assertion may seem to humans accustomed to traveling a mere 70 miles per hour on the highway, it makes a lot of sense on a cosmic scale. Consider this: If the observable Universe was reduced to the size of planet Earth, traversing the Milky Way Galaxy would be roughly equivalent to walking three houses down the block to visit your neighbor. And yet, traveling at the cosmic speed limit of our smaller, Earth-size universe, that short jaunt would take 100,000 years!\n This example showcases just how tediously slow exploring the galaxy would be for a ship traveling at the speed of light. Such a journey would span more than a hundred human generations!\n Even if you don't consider humanity's self-centered wish for interstellar light-speed travel and instead think about photons dashing across our solar system, the speed of light still seems positively sluggish. As astrophysicist Brian Koberlein calculated, it takes 45 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Jupiter, and five hours for it to reach Pluto.\n And of course, when gazing at the sky with the naked eye, we're viewing some stars as they were more than 4,000 years in the past -- that's how long it takes their light to reach us!\n So now that we've ascertained that light is not fast but rather is excruciatingly slow, we can now turn to a more pressing and difficult matter: Why?\n Theoretical physicists can muse and cosmologists can measure, but all their learned tinkering currently leads back to an inescapable answer: Because.\n Theoretical physicist Gennaro Tedesco provided a slightly more satisfying version:\n The universe is made such that photons propagate with that velocity, there is no reason why it should be so, but it is just the way it is. Physics does not explain why things are what they are, rather it explains how to make predictions by using proven models.\n Okay, so like in much of theoretical physics, the answer is effectively a non-answer, and we're still stuck in a slow universe.\n To salvage this situation, let's examine a scenario where light is much faster. What would existence be like if, say, the speed of light was boosted by a factor of 1,000? Steve Jones explored the hypothetical. A light-speed vessel could cross the Milky Way in less than a century! A trip to Alpha Centauri, home to a potentially habitable planet, would take fewer than two days! Computers and networks would run faster thanks to enhanced optical speeds! We might be more likely to receive signals from extraterrestrials!\n But \xe2\x80\x93 and this is a big but \xe2\x80\x93 the Sun would burn a million times hotter. We'd be cooked.\n So you better learn to love our finely tuned speed of light, however slothlike it may be. If it were any faster, life on Planet Earth might not exist.\n"

S'Story Highlights\n Prashant Kishor, election strategist, had cabinet minister rank \n But he cannot be linked to Nitish Kumar\'s new alliance with BJP \n Prashant Kishor wants to work with anti-BJP parties \nPatna: Nitish Kumar\'s list of exes is growing - along with the Congress and Lalu Yadav who are now a part of his past, top aide Prashant Kishor is being cut looses. Sources close to the young election strategist and Nitish Kumar say the separation is mutual, without rancour, and in acceptance of the fact that the new political landscape requires Prashant Kishore to shift out of the Chief Minister\'s home where he lived while in Patna. \n However, Prashant Kishor left the Bihar capital in April 2016 to work with the Congress on its campaign to get Amarinder Singh elected as Chief Minister of Punjab. He has, since then, spent only seven hours in Patna, said sources, on a short stopover in April. At the time, he handed a resignation letter to the Chief Minister. It was undated. Nitish Kumar, he said, could use it whenever needed. \n Prashant Kishor met Nitish Kumar through top aides of the Chief Minister in 2014. Both were smarting from political setbacks. Prashant Kishor helped design and deploy the hi-tech campaign that saw Narendra Modi become Prime Minister. Nitish Kumar, in a major miscalculation, had aborted his alliance with the PM\'s party ahead of the general election. Prashant Kishor was being sidelined by the PM\'s closest aide, Amit Shah. Nitish Kumar had won just two parliamentary seats in Bihar. \n They decided to work together on the re-election bid of Nitish Kumar for a third back-to-back term as Chief Minister. Nitish Kumar allegedly ignored Prashant Kishor\'s early objections to proceed with a three-way alliance with the Congress and former rival Lalu Yadav. For the opposing team, the Prime Minister campaigned relentlessly across Bihar. But it was the "Grand Alliance" or Maha-Gathbandhan, which combined the caste-based support groups of the different parties that proved super-strong. Nitish Kumar took office and the opposition at the national level began accepting that to defeat PM Modi and his immense approval ratings, it was this sort of multi-party arrangement that would have to be constructed. \n Prashant Kishor, as thanks for Nitish Kumar\'s big win, was given the rank of a cabinet minister and assigned to implement a major programme - the Bihar Vikas Mission - for the development of the state that included seven schemes including electricity for all and credit cards for students. Prashant Kishor, advised by Nitish Kumar to dress in a white kurta-pyjama while in Patna, remained an occupant of the Chief Minister\'s home at the time (Nitish Kumar has since moved into another house) but accepted neither the salary nor the perks due to him with his new status. \n He did not attend a single meeting called to implement the policies entrusted to him. But the Chief Minister had by then accepted his desire to work for the Congress to win the Punjab election. There was no conflict of interest - the party was after all in alliance with Nitish Kumar in his home state. He was loaning an asset with a track record of electoral home runs. \n Though his client won Punjab, it was pelted in the politically-prized state of Uttar Pradesh and the hill state of Uttarakhand despite Prashant Kishor designing both campaigns. He then moved south to explore working with Jagan Mohan Reddy, opposition leader in Andhra Pradesh. It was earlier this month that the deal was formally announced as done. \nLast week, when Nitish Kumar junked the Congress and Lalu Yadav to restore his old alliance with the BJP, it became clear that Prashant Kishor would have to officially be dropped from any role in Bihar. The 40-year-old strategist has made no secret of his commitment to working with anti-BJP parties and in particular the Congress to get even for being marginalised after the big 2014 triumph. Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP, now the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, has in the past questioned the senior rank accorded to Prashant Kishor, who, he said, was perpetually MIA. \n It\'s unclear whether Nitish Kumar will announce that Prashant Kishor is no longer linked in any way to his administration. Given his fondness for the strategist, a loose understanding of moving on may suffice. For Prashant Kishor, said to now be keen on foraying into Tamil Nadu, the timing is propitious - he is now free of any obligations that would bind him to Patna.\n'

He moved to the top of the leaderboard with an initial best time of 1m56.039s a third of the way through the 30-minute session. \nHe then strung three fastest sectors together on his second run as he lowered his benchmark to a 1m55.786s - leaving him 0.460 seconds clear of early pacesetter Colin Turkington. \nGoff returned to the pits early and, with WSR BMW 125i M Sport driver Turkington unable to improve, celebrated a maiden BTCC pole - beating his previous best of second from the Donington Park round earlier this year. \n"We rolled the car out in FP1 as we\'d left it after the test day [but] the car felt nothing like it had then," said Goff. \n"The lads did a bit of work after FP2 and it completely transformed it." \nThe factory Team BMR Subaru of Ash Sutton had an initial effort that was good enough for third chalked off for exceeding track limits, but a lap with a little more than a minute of the session remaining returned him to the position behind Turkington. \nSpeedworks Motorsport\'s Tom Ingram was fourth in his Toyota Avensis, ahead of the similar car of Handy Motorsport\'s Rob Austin - who rotated at Riches shortly after his fast lap.\xe2\x80\xa8 \nAndrew Jordan was seventh in his Pirtek Racing WSR BMW 125i M Sport, while Jason Plato improved to eighth with the final lap of the session in his Subaru Levorg. \nChampionship leader Gordon Shedden endured a tough session, and could only qualify 20th. \n Saddled with the maximum 75 kilograms of success ballast, Shedden finished the session 1.657s slower than polesitter Goff. \nShedden\'s team-mate Matt Neal had sat as high as third in the order in the first half of the session, but his Honda Civic failed a ride height test as he returned to the pits and he subsequently had all his times deleted. \nWith his car raised, Neal returned to the weigh bridge after an outlap to ensure his car was legal and only made it out on track for a pair of timed runs in the final five minutes, ending up 23rd.\nQUALIFYING RESULTS:\nPos\nDriver\nTeam\nCar\nGap\n1\nJack Goff\nEurotech Racing\nHonda\n1m55.786s\n2\nColin Turkington\nWSR\nBMW\n0.460s\n3\nAsh Sutton\nTeam BMR\nSubaru\n0.589s\n4\nTom Ingram\nSpeedworks Motorsport\nToyota\n0.877s\n5\nAdam Morgan\nCiceley Racing\nMercedes\n0.900s\n6\nRob Austin\nHandy Motorsport\nToyota\n1.004s\n7\nAndrew Jordan\nWSR\nBMW\n1.078s\n8\nJason Plato\nTeam BMR\nSubaru\n1.238s\n9\nRob Collard\nWSR\nBMW\n1.239s\n10\nJake Hill\nTeam Hard\nVolkswagen\n1.271s\n11\nMichael Epps\nTeam Hard\nVolkswagen\n1.281s\n12\nMat Jackson\nMotorbase\nFord\n1.354s\n13\nAiden Moffat\nLaser Tools Racing\nMercedes\n1.385s\n14\nAnt Whorton-Eales\nAmD Tuning\nAudi\n1.405s\n15\nTom Chilton\nPower Maxed Racing\nVauxhall\n1.476s\n16\nOllie Jackson\nAmD Tuning\nAudi\n1.489s\n17\nJosh Price\nTeam BMR\nSubaru\n1.556s\n18\nDave Newsham\nBTC Racing\nChevrolet\n1.582s\n19\nJosh Cook\nTriple Eight/MG\nMG\n1.635s\n20\nGordon Shedden\nDynamics/Honda\nHonda\n1.657s\n21\nChris Smiley\nBTC Racing\nChevrolet\n1.663s\n22\nBrett Smith\nEurotech Racing\nHonda\n1.676s\n23\nMatt Neal\nDynamics/Honda\nHonda\n1.778s\n24\nMatt Simpson\nDynamics/Honda\nHonda\n1.804s\n25\nAron Taylor-Smith\nTriple Eight/MG\nMG\n1.875s\n26\nJames Cole\nTeam BMR\nSubaru\n1.921s\n27\nSenna Proctor\nPower Maxed Racing\nVauxhall\n1.932s\n28\nWill Burns\nTeam Hard\nVolkswagen\n2.525s\n29\nStephen Jelley\nTeam Parker Racing\nFord\n2.620s\n30\nMartin Depper\nMotorbase\nFord\n3.019s\n31\nStewart Lines\nMaximum Motorsport\nFord\n4.965s\nShare this article on  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Google+  Email\n'

S' Redesigning a website, being a continuous process, and being the fruit of rigorous analysis and evaluation, it often turns out to be difficult on the part of the designers to actually realize when a website is more or less perfect to be launched for the users to experience it. Every time a website looks almost perfect, the designer gets baffled by some odds or the other and falls prey to a vacillation between to launch it or to take yet one more time to revise and to revitalize it with few touch \n Redesigning the look of an iconic brand or in other words to conferring a striking change to the visual appeal of a well known brand is quite challenging as it involves a whole lot of risk and criticism. Changing the identity of an iconic brand inside out, instead of aiming at re-branding, must look forward towards giving the existing identity of the concerned brand a new look, may be a little bold one to set it apart from the crowd of other corporate brands in the global front, while adhering s \n'

S'Supreme Court Judge Madan B Lokur today advocated the need for a better infrastructure, timely release of funds and setting up vulnerable witness courts for the welfare of needy children in Madhya Pradesh. \n "In the morning session, some valuable suggestions came from the participants. They have suggested that there is a problem of infrastructure in Juvenile Justice Boards, Child Welfare Committees... The infrastructure is not good," Justice Lokur said presiding over the state conference on Juvenile Justice and Capacity Building organised by UNICEF among others, here. \n "There is a need to improve and strengthen infrastructure there," Supreme Court\'s Juvenile Justice Committee Chairman Justice Lokur added. \n "There is also a need of manpower at these centres and institutes," he said. \n "Posts need to be created (in these centres)," he suggested. \n Looking at Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the stage, he said "if you please look (into them), this will help tremendously." \n Justice Lokur laying thrust on digital India concept, said, "I think we need to provide computer also to child care institutions... because unless we have the data about - number of children, what is their age, how they are? What food and clothes they are getting? \n "Unless we are aware of this, we can\'t make progress. \nComputer will generate huge data base and facilitate planning," he added. \n "We also need to look at vulnerable witness courts. \nYou have a lot of cases of sexual offences against women, against children under the POCSO Act," Justice Lokur said. \n "Can you imagine a person who has raped some lady is standing there as an accused and the lady victim is being cross examined in the presence of the accused person, who had may be two or three months ago raped this woman," he quipped. \n "It is very, very difficult for such a lady to give evidence and it does not need skillful cross examiner...any lawyer can demolish the statement given by that lady," he added. \n "The same thing can happen to a child. The child who is 8 years or 10 years old," he added. \n "We recently had a case in the Supreme Court where a 10-year-old was raped and has become pregnant. Can you imagine the girl going to witness box and giving evidence and saying this is what happened," he quipped. \n "So, we need to protect witnesses. We need to protect witnesses whether they are women - whether they are children. \nWe need to have these vulnerable witness courts. It is not a very difficult job again," the Judge added. \n He said that the cost of setting up such a court comes to Rs 10 lakh. \n Some states have opened these courts, he added. \n "When we are dealing with children, we are not talking about punishment as deterrent. We are talking about punished as something restorative, to bring a child back to society, to rehabilitate the child in the society," he said. \n "So for this, we need some trained counsellors and psychiatrists," he added. \n In their speeches, Madhya Pradesh High Court Chief Justice Hemant Gupta as special guest and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as chief guest underlined the need of educating and making children an ideal citizen of the country. \n UNICEF state representative Michael Steven Juma in his address said, "protection of children is a critical indicator of the fulfillment of the rights of every children, which is fundamental requirement for realising other right. \n "Proper implementation of the law is a precursor to safeguarding the rights of children," Juma added.\n(This article has not been edited by DNA\'s editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n'

S'Dhaka: Bangladesh has to wait till 2019 to know whether the number of tigers in the Sunderbans has gone up or fallen further, according to officials conducting a census in the country\'s lone natural tiger habitat. It will take two years to determine the exact number of Royal Bengal Tigers living in the Bangladesh part of Sunderbans, they said. The Forest Department is conducting the census in collaboration with WildTeam, an NGO working for tiger conservation in the country, under the Bengal Tiger Conservation Activity project funded by the USAID, the Dhaka Tribune reported.\nFile photo\nThe census, which began in November last year, is using camera trapping methodology to determine the overall tiger population in the world\'s largest mangrove forest, of which around 60 per cent lies within Bangladesh, the daily reported. The most recent census which concluded in 2015 recorded a tiger population of only 106 in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans, down from 440 in 2004. Project officials will want to know if this number has held up, or fallen further.\n Data collection for the current census has already been completed in the Satkhira range of the mangrove forest and will be extended to the Khulna, Sharankhola and Chandpai ranges by 2019, the newspaper reported. The primary monitoring and count using the cameras in Satkhira began on December 1 and ended on March 15. A total of 45 officials and experts divided into six teams conducted the survey to determine the tiger population in Satkhira range.\n In addition to recording tiger numbers, the project is also tracking their population density, movement and activity. "We set up 804 cameras at 402 stations in the range to collect data of tiger movement and density in the area," said Md Sayed Ali, divisional forest officer at the Sundarbans West Zone. Using photos taken by the cameras, the population in Satkhira range will be determined by analysing the stripes on the tigers, each tiger has its own unique set of stripes, similar to fingerprints for humans.\n "We will have the accurate number of tigers in Satkhira by September," Sayed said. Besides the camera trapping method, the team has also surveyed tiger activity in the canals. Amir Hossain Chowdhury, director of the census project, said: "The photos are being analysed using the latest technologies. Once the analysis is done, we will get an idea about the population density and footprints of tigers in Satkhira range."\n Once the census in Satkhira is complete, the project will progress to survey the other three ranges of the Sundarbans, he added. "It might take two more years to complete the survey in the entire Sundarbans and find the exact number of tigers in the forest," Amir said. The Forest Department has undertaken the project following the declaration at the International Tiger Forum which took place in St Petersburg, Russia in 2010. \n'

S'Siddaramaiah\n BENGALURU: Prodded by the Kannada Development Authority and faced with a barrage of protests by Kannada outfits, chief minister Siddaramaiah asked the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC) on Friday to drop Hindi from its signage. \n This means only Kannada and English will be on all signboards. \n  The chief minister has written to the Centre that the three-language format would be counterproductive, given the sentiments in the state, and that Kannada and English in signage were more practical. \n Despite two attempts by protesters to deface its signboards, BMRC had continued to use Hindi saying it was operating under instructions from the Centre. In the past few weeks, as the agita tion intensified for the state language policy to be implemented, BMRC sought instructions from the state government to do away with the three-language format. \n LK Ateeq, principal secretary in the chief minister\'s office, confirmed to TOI the government had issued instructions to BMRC to use only Kannada and English. While this should put an end to the ongoing controversy, it may not be a permanent solution since the Centre is an equal stakeholder in the project and is yet to weigh in. \n In his letter to Union urban development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote: "I would like to submit that the stand of the Government of India of using the three-language formula is not reasonable. Although both the Government of India and government of Karnataka have equal (50:50) equity stake in BMRC, the financial contribution of the state government is much more than that of the central government. Moreover, the supervision of operations and providing security to BMRC are the responsibility of the state government." The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said the state "has also undertaken to repay all the loans contracted by BMRC and bear the operating losses. Therefore, it would be appropriate that the policies of the state government are implemented in the project. I would therefore request you to review your earlier decision in this regard". \n The Centre had instructed BMRC in December to follow the three-language policy. Accordingly, signage was in Kannada, English and Hindi. Siddaramaiah said protesters had been dealt with strictly when they tried to deface the signboards twice this month but added that the agitations could not be taken lightly. \n "You would agree that in the face of continued agitation and demands from litterateurs and intellectuals for giving primacy to the language of the state and the languages with which people of the city and the commuters are familiar, it is counter-productive to continue to insist on the use of three languages including Hindi," he said in the letter. "It is not essential to use Hindi in signage as the commuters who use the metro are comfortable with reading and understanding Kannada andor English. Therefore, the state government is compelled to ask BMRC to temporarily redesign the signage and name boards in metro stations without using Hindi," he said. \n BMRC, however, said it was unaware of the order. "We are yet to receive such a communication from the government," MD Pradeep Singh Kharola said, without specifying whether BMRC would implement such an order. \n Kannada activists and writers spearheading the protests welcomed the move. "BMRC has been violating the state language policy since 2011and although it has taken the government so many years to act, the decision is welcome and we hope that the government ensures its implementation," said Arun Javgal of Banavasi Balaga which started the language agitation. Writer Baragur Ramachandra said the larger issue was "intrusion of the federal structure" in local cultures and sentiments. "Removal of Hindi from signage is only a symbolic move," he said. \n'

S'Where the tiger thrives, we know that nature is alive and well. If our current politicians lack the wisdom and foresight to know the value of this animal and its deep connection to our own future, then we must replace them with younger politicians who do\n  For far too long, those in whose hands the destiny of India\'s 1.3 billion people lies have har boured the misconception that protecting wildlife or natural ecosystems is some kind of `favour\' we do to nature. Nothing can be farther from the truth. In fact, nature is quite capable of handling most problems we are creating for it, but the real danger is to us and our children because in the pursuit of `development\' as defined by those who understand short-term economics we are facing all manner of crises that simply cannot be solved by technology , money or even our most fervent prayers. \n  These problems have everything to do with those four key human faults or frailties -ignorance, arrogance, avarice and apathy . It is these errors in our developmental compass that I have been trying to eliminate (with great success when it comes to young India, much less success when it comes to adults!) Here then are some simple tiger-priorities we have been communicating with children, which should be easy enough for even most (environmentally) checked-out planners to understand: \n OUR ECONOMY IS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF STABLE ECOLOGY, NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND \n The argument against taking vital long-term measures to pro tect our rivers, coastal habitats such as the magnificent Sunderbans mangrove forests, our lakes, grasslands and forests is that "India is a poor country and cannot afford the `luxury\' of environmental protection". This is not merely misplaced thinking, but downright dangerous. One of the last public utterances made by the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, before he demitted office was: "Next year the monsoon looks like it will be good, so we can expect our GDP to rise." Translated, it means every last nuance of our lives is governed by nature -agriculture, municipalities, factories, health, education, social stability. This is incontrovertible and I, for one, have never fully understood why seemingly savvy , intelligent leaders cannot get their heads around such a simple reality .I have faith that their innocence, trust and persistent reminders can and will change the world for the better. \n CHILDREN OPERATE ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TIGER IS A METAPHOR FOR ALL OF NATURE \n To save the tiger, we must save its forest home. In the process of doing this we end up saving all species, plant and animal, that live in tiger-inhabited areas. That\'s not all. These forests just happen to feed pure, fresh water into over 600 Indian rivers. And if that were not benefit enough, they sequester and store carbon and thus contribute by helping us to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \n We have taken this rationale to over a million children over the past five years and today these children have become positive agents of change who are influencing their faculties, school friends, families, and even powerful decision-makers ranging from Prime Ministers, Cabinet ministers, chief ministers and corporate heads. \n MAKE INVIOLABILITY OF PROTECTED AREAS A TOP GOVERNMENTAL PRIORITY \n India currently has over 600 protected forests. Together, these account for a little above 20% of the country\'s forested area, and under 5% of our land area. Yet, budgetary allocation is far too low, our staff is far less supported than they should be and every once in a while, even as the `system\' sings praises about tigers and the need to protect them, actual habitats continue to be threatened for short-term gains to facilitate the building of dams, roads, mines and more. \n PREVENT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, EXPAND WILDERNESSES AND RESTORE CORRIDORS \n It is well established that animals living on islands, or in habitats that are so small and fragmented as to mimic island conditions, are far more vulnerable to local extinction than species that live in contiguous, undisturbed habitat. The government must provide better protection to these and understand that tiger conservation will be a reality only if reserves are connected to one another so that tigers have larger population pools and larger areas in which to hunt and breed. \n WORK TO COUNTER CLIMATE CHANGE \n India must address climate change at all levels -central and state governments, corporates and individuals, cities and villages. We must adopt a "we are all in this together" approach, rather than wait for evidence that other governments are taking steps to correct their own contributions to the problem. \n RECOGNISE THAT THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE IS FUELLING TERRORISM \n The poaching of tigers and their prey species is rampant in India. In combination with the threats posed by habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and climate change, the situation is already beyond critical. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau needs to be strengthened and staffed by professionals and also needs to be linked to information and intelligence-gathering and decision-making that affects our internal security. Along with strong anti-poaching units on the frontlines, we must reopen communication lines with trusted local community members who could provide both information and field strength. In the case of hunting tribes, rehabilitation and measures to provide alternative livelihoods away from tiger habitats would be one vital step forward. \n CONSERVATION MUST RELY ON SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE \n Our commitment must be based on the soundest wildlife science -it has been science and the dedicated work of Indian and non-Indian wildlife biologists that have clearly shown what is needed to preserve this animal. \n For its part, the tiger does what it can to sur vive. Given undisturbed forest, water and prey species, the big cat breeds well. This is an animal in its evolutionary prime, highly adaptable. Where the tiger thrives, we know that nature is alive and well. If our current politicians lack the wisdom and foresight to know the value of this animal and its deep connection to our own future, then we must replace them with younger politicians who do.Common sense tells us that the degradation of the tiger and its home -the biota -and the diminishment of our own lives are two sides of one coin. And towards this end, those of us who have battled for decades do understand thatthe best tiger `habitat\' resides in the human heart. Here is where we must find space for them, or we will leave no space for them anywhere else. \n -  Bittu Sahgal \n  (The writer is a celebrated conservationist and also the Editor and Chief Mentor of Sanctuary Nature Foundation) \n EXPERTS BAT FOR THE BIG CAT \n The tiger conservation scenario has been very positive in the last four years in Bengal. The first markers of this trend were sightings at Buxa Tiger Reserve and Neora Valley National Park. Also, there has been no incident of tiger poaching in last four years in the state. Besides, other than the two tiger reserves -Buxa and Sunderbans National park -there have been reports of tiger sightings in other forest areas as well. \n According to the ongoing tiger census with camera traps, the number is roughly around 103, but we will get the final number in November. The Centre and state have decided to start a new project at Buxa called Tiger Augmentation Plan, where we will bring tigers from other forests and help them breed. According to our survey, Buxa can house 10 to 12 tigers with ease. \n - RAVI KANT SINHA , \n IFS principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, West Bengal \n Unlike other forests in the country, Sunderbans is free of one menace -human encroachment in forest areas. We have clear demarcation between villages and forest areas and it has been like that for many years. But we have our own challenges. The two biggest would be poaching and man-animal conflicts. Though there have been a couple of natural deaths, there hasn\'t been a single instance of poaching in the past four years. This has been possible because of heavy patrolling by forest department and other administrative bodies. We have also resolved most mananimal conflicts by putting up nylon nets in the forest area.Last year, the number of tigers was 81 and this year it\'s 87.Importantly, this number doesn\'t include cubs and sub-adults. \n - NILANJAN MALLICK , \n IFS chief conservator of forests and field director, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve \n Every hour, every minute, every second, hundreds of tiger images are uploaded on social media. They win thousands of likes, comments and shares. Prince, Charger, Ustad, Noor, Machhli, Maya, Gabbar, Bittu, Jai -these wild tigers have illustrious names and have their family trees published, their day-to-day activities photographed and recorded minutely. These tigers from different tiger reserves are a privileged class. \n But as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority or NTCA\'s 2014 assessment, around 800 tigers live outside protected areas. They are vulnerable to poaching and can come into conflict with humans. This is a dangerously unsafe number and these tigers don\'t have forests to live in. They are not admired or even seen by tourists or photographers. We at SHER feel that Global Tiger Day is a tool to put the tiger in the people\'s consciousness and show them how this royal animal is fighting poachers, miners, farmers, climate change, deforestation, highways, politicians and the urban admirers. We do our bit in the conflict areas around Sunderbans Tiger Reserve to win the support of fringe populations who are into direct conflict with tigers in the mangroves. \n - JOYDIP KUNDU , \n wildlife activist, SHER \n'

S'It is important to acknowledge that lupus is actually called as autoimmune disease. This disease will be weaken your immune system and keep them from protecting your body from any harmful viruses and bacteria. Lupus disease has no cure but unfortunately it is said that there are more than 5 million people in the world suffer from this disease each year. There are a lot of causes of lupus, however; most of doctors believe that the common triggers of lupus are environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors may include regular exposure to sunlight, exposure to dangerous chemical and the careless use of prescription medication.\n. Eat A Healthy Diet: \nDiet is the important first step on how to prevent lupus naturally. There is no particular diet program for the patients with lupus disease. However, some researchers have seen the significant reduce of lupus risk when the patients are advised to eat healthy diet. We all know that lupus disease may easily make people gain weight or lose weight with no good purposes.\n2. Avoid Regular Exposure To Sunlight:\nExposure to sunlight will worsen the symptoms of lupus because patients with lupus disease will feel more sensitive to ultraviolet rays, including the sun light or artificial light inside house. Therefore, as the way on how to prevent lupus disease, you need to protect yourself from UV radiation. I suggest that you should wear a protective clothing and sunscreen when you have to go out. It is important not to go out from 10 a.m to 4 p.m because this peak time has strong UV radiation which can harm your skin badly.\n3. Acupuncture: \nAcupuncture is the ancient Chinese medicine practice, which is also the effective treatment on how to prevent lupus. Acupuncture will use the needles to insert through the thin skin at the specific point in the body. This method aims to help the patients relax and reduce inflammatory as well as decrease stress, tension. Stress and negative emotion are the environment factors which develop lupus disease.\n4. Take Enough Sleep And Resting:\nSleeping and resting will give your body time to restore the energy and fix the problems. They are also the ways on how to prevent lupus that you should not ignore. It is the fact that for patient with lupus disease, if they do a lot of thing during a day,\n5. Keep The Regular Exercise Routine: \nWe all know that exercising regularly will help you have a healthy body and mind. Exercising also gives the relief for patients suffering from lupus disease. The effects of exercise will include reducing stress, increasing strength, promoting heart health, boosting muscle strength and duration, getting rid of negative emotion.\n6. See Your Doctor Regularly: \nAlthough you have some effective tips on how to prevent lupus, you should see your doctor regularly to check your health. Your symptoms may be worse, therefore; they will help you prevent flare-ups.\n'

S' Neha khaitan, painter\nA Bharatnatyam dancer as well as a painter, Neha Khaitan believes that there is a deep connection between varied art forms. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technical aspects change according to the medium but the expression remains the soul \xe2\x80\x94 the core of all forms of fine arts,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\nHer series of works entitled Imprint, are presently on display at the Icon Art Gallery in the city.\nNeha\xe2\x80\x99s affinity for both the media is inspired by her passion to create and express her thoughts about certain subjects. Her series of works entitled Imprint, are presently on display at the Icon Art Gallery in the city. To represent her concepts cohesively, the artist has created appropriate visual symbols to create dialogues with the viewer. \nHer surrealist approach accelerates the intensity of her expression as well as excels in fascinating the viewers with a bolt from the blue.\nNeha\xe2\x80\x99s technique is quite interesting. She first creates several images digitally, then she composes sections using the images and finally puts them together harmoniously to create interesting collages, which are finally printed as complete pieces of art. Her surrealist approach accelerates the intensity of her expression as well as excels in fascinating the viewers with a bolt from the blue.\nArt work from Neha\xe2\x80\x99s series of works entitled Imprint\nOne of Neha\xe2\x80\x99s most intriguing compositions depicts a scientifically detailed image of a human heart caged within the arches of thorny stems. The clusters of flowers that run across the composition create a stark contrast with the thorns and depict some raw emotions and beautiful memories hidden inside a melancholy heart. This unusual style of weaving and juxtaposing myriad realistic elements together grants a distinct stance and meaning to Neha\xe2\x80\x99s work.\nSpeaking about one of her artworks \xe2\x80\x94 Flower Power \xe2\x80\x94exhibited at the gallery, the young artist says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe gigantic, concrete building in the work represents the society and its conventional ways and rigidity. I have shown the building being cut by flowers, which manifests the strength of love that can change and transcend everything with its magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'Three more flood-related deaths were reported in West Bengal, taking the toll to 31, even as Indian Air Force helicopters dropped food and medicines in marooned areas and rescued nine people in West Midnapore district.\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the situation had improved but could worsen again if more water was released from the dams.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree more persons have died in the last 24 hours. The toll since July 21 (when the heavy rains started) is 31,\xe2\x80\x9d a state government official said but did not give the details as to where and how the fatalities occurred.\nAround 2,067 relief camps were opened in the 11 flood-hit districts where 165 villages spread across 104 blocks had been inundated due to heavy monsoon rains and release of water from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dams since last weekend.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe (flood) situation has got better but the problem will again rise if more water is released. The quantum of water released was more than the amount during the 1978 floods,\xe2\x80\x9d Banerjee said while leaving the state secretariat Nabanna.\nAsked about the stranded people in Pratappur village of West Midnapore district\xe2\x80\x99s Ghatal block, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cMany persons were rescued from Ghatal and we are trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA Defence Ministry spokesperson said nine people, including three women and five children, were rescued from the area by air force helicopters that took off from the Barrackpore air base.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine persons were winched up and food and medicines dropped,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesperson said.\nThe state government official said the situation had improved in the affected districts due to the rainfall receding and the DVC releasing less water.\nMeanwhile, the DVC withdrew the yellow flood warning message for Panchet dam in neighbouring Jharkhand.\n'

S'Reported by :\nReliance Jio has created yet another disruption in the Indian telecom market with its new tariff plans. A few weeks back, the new entrant rolled out new tariff plans of Rs. 349 and Rs. 399. The Rs. 399 plan offers same benefits as the Rs. 309 plan of 1GB data per day and unlimited voice calls, SMS.\nTo counter this plan, incumbent operators such as Vodafone, Idea Cellular, and Bharti Airtel has rolled out attractive tariff plans to retain its customers. Here are the five tariff plans unveiled by the top three telecom operators in recent times.\nAirtel Rs. 799 Plan\nTo counter Jio, Airtel has brought a new high volume of Rs. 799 data pack for prepaid users. Airtel is now offering a prepaid plan of Rs. 799 focussed for high volume data users. The Rs. 799 plan offers 3GB per day of 2G/3G/4G data and unlimited local and STD calls to any network. The validity of the pack is 28 days. This plan is valid only for 29 days unlike the Jio\xe2\x80\x99s plan; nevertheless, it offers 3GB data per day.\nVodafone Rs. 244 Plan\nThe all new Rs. 244 plan from Vodafone gives 1GB 3G/4G data per day, and unlimited Vodafone to Vodafone calls for 70 days. This plan is applicable for all Vodafone users, however, the price of the plan differs with the circle.\nIdea Cellular Rs. 357, Rs. 697, Rs. 897, and Rs. 1197\nIdea Cellular unveiled four new plans for Himachal Pradesh users recently. Starting with the Rs. 357 plan, it gives 1GB data per day for 28 days; the Rs. 697 plan offers 1.5GB data per day for 84 days, while the Rs. 897 plan offers 2GB data per day for 84 days. Lastly, the Rs. 1197 plan provides 2.5GB data per day for 84 days. All these plans offer unlimited voice calls to any network.\nVodafone Rs. 346 Plan\nThe Rs. 346 plan from Vodafone offers 1GB data per day, and unlimited voice calls to any network for 56 days. However, the voice calls are limited to 300 minutes per day, and 1200 minutes per week. Vodafone is offering 56GB data with this plan. Previously, these benefits were offered under the Rs. 356 plan. This plan is valid for existing users as well.\nAirtel Rs. 399 Plan\nBharti Airtel has come up with a new plan of Rs. 399 a few weeks ago. It offers 1GB data per day, and unlimited voice calls to any network with a data cap of 300 minutes per day and 1200 minutes per week. However, this plan is applicable only for 4G handset users.\nNote: Some of these plans are user specific. So, please check with your operator before proceeding for recharge.\n  Story first published on: July 29, 2017 at 10:09 am  \n'

S' An unstable childhood could lead to harmful eating habits in adulthood, new research suggests. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity is a serious issue in the United States, impacting over one third of the adult population.\nThe CDC also estimate that the yearly healthcare expenses of individuals living with obesity are more than $1,400 higher than those of people with a normal weight.\nPrevious research has convincingly linked adult obesity with low socioeconomic status both in childhood and later in life.\nNow, a recent study from Florida State University in Tallahassee, in collaboration with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, goes beyond that.\nDr. Jon K. Maner, from the Department of Psychology at Florida State University, and his colleagues have looked at how other destabilizing events from a person\'s childhood - such as exposure to divorce, crime, and other types of social and environmental instability - could lead to a lifestyle that promotes obesity.\nTheir findings were recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nStable versus unstable childhoods\nThe researchers used "Life History Theory" (LHT), an analytical framework that, in a behavioral science context, places the amount of stability experienced in a person\'s childhood at the root of their lifestyle and life choices, or "life-history strategies."\nLHT signals two kinds of life-history strategies: faster life-history strategies and slower life-history strategies. Faster life-history strategies are marked by the search for immediate gratification, such as having more sexual partners in early life, having more children earlier, and exhibiting a generally impulsive behavior.\nAccording to LHT, people with faster life-history strategies are likely to have had unstable childhoods, in which they were exposed to privations of one kind or another. This is why, later in life, they are prone to favor "living in the moment," without adequately planning for the future.\n"Experiencing an unpredictable environment in childhood sensitizes people to the idea that it\'s difficult to plan for the future because if you don\'t know what\'s around the next corner, you live for the now. They end up focusing on short-term rather than long-term goals and they\'re not good at delaying gratification."\nDr. Jon K. Maner\nAt the opposite side of the spectrum, people with slower life-history strategies are likely to have had very stable and well-structured childhoods, which led them to expect a stable future.\nSlower life-history strategies are focused on long-term outcome behaviors characterized by more cautious deliberation.\nSlow life-history strategy more healthful\nDespite previous research pointing to links between childhood stress and adult obesity, this is the first time that LHT has been used to explain behaviors that lead to an unhealthful diet.\nDr. Maner and his colleagues looked at how lack of stability in childhood can be a predictor of behaviors that lead to obesity in adulthood.\nThe study found a direct link between fast life-history strategies and eating habits that can lead to obesity. The researchers observed that people with more instinct-driven life choices were much likelier to eat even when they were not hungry.\n"If you don\'t know where the next meal is coming from, it would make sense to eat what you can now. But people with a slow-life-history strategy [...] are inclined to listen to their body and eat based on their current needs," says Dr. Maner.\nThis is why the study is important, in the researchers\' view: it allows people to identify the root of their bad dietary practices, and it may educate parents on how best to adapt their behavior to ensure their children\'s well-being later in life.\n"Our research suggests it\'s not just about reducing stress, it\'s more about creating structure and predictability for children," explains Dr. Maner.\n"Routines teach children to have expectations that, when met, result in a sense of certainty and structure. Theoretically, that feeling of predictability instills a slower-life-history strategy, which may reduce obesity in adulthood."\nDr. Jon K. Maner\n'

S"And the light on the new teaser of probably a roadster will be revealed at Pebble Beach Concours event this year. The BMW concept roadster will be shown on August 17, 2017.\nAs of now, it's only a guessing game and we expect could it to be the new Z4 which BMW is working with Toyota. It could also be a concept version that's near production form, as BMW tends to do at these types of events.\nThe new BMW Z4 shares its platform with the new Toyota Supra. The only other information we get about the car is from the teaser sketch. The car is a convertible and appears to have cowls behind the seats, indicating it could be a two-seater speedster.\nThe long nose also suggests that this could be a front-engined car. The size is fitting for a speedster version of the company's upcoming 8 Series coupe.\nDriveSpark Thinks!\nThe silhouette and the lines of the car look very much closer the upcoming new BMW Z4. With electrification of cars is the way forward for carmakers, the car could even be the new i8.\nBut we'll have to wait till August 17, 2017, to be sure of the car. Stay tuned to DriveSpark as we update you.\n"

S"Lionel Messi and Barcelona have identified an appropriate replacement for the Brazilian star. \nMessi identifies Neymar's replacement\nWhat's the story?\nOver the last couple of weeks, speculation over Neymar's future has intensified significantly. Latest developments suggest that the Brazilian superstar could indeed bid farewell to the Catalan giants with a move to Paris Saint-Germain. \nBarcelona officials have made it abundantly clear that they would like to retain the flamboyant 25-year old. However, the club has admitted that they will not keep the winger against his will and have resigned to the possibility of selling him, should he choose to leave. \nThe Spanish giants have reportedly identified a potential replacement in the form of Tottenham Hotspur star Dele Alli. \nIn case you didn't know...\nThe Neymar - PSG transfer saga has been the talk of the world for the last month or so, with Unai Emery's side reportedly willing to trigger the striker's exorbitant release clause of nearly \xc2\xa3200 million. Neymar further added fuel to the fire after storming off the ground in the middle of a Barcelona training session, following a heated altercation with team-mate and new signing, Nelson Semedo.\nThe Brazilian has also allegedly cancelled a scheduled commercial visit to China, claiming to be busy dealing with the transfer. With his departure seemingly imminent, reports suggest that Barcelona have now set their sight on Dele Alli, after Lionel Messi apparently claimed to prefer him over the Catalan side's other prospects.\nThe heart of the matter\nThe Spanish side, who finished only 3 points behind champions Real Madrid last season, will be gutted if and when Neymar leaves and will undeniably require an able replacement. Manager Ernesto Valverde has witnessed his side being linked with the likes of Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Chelsea's Eden Hazard.\nHowever, both English sides have expressed reluctance in allowing their star players to leave for the Blaugrana, resulting in the emergence of Dele Alli as a new target.\nLionel Messi reportedly believes that the 21-year old would suit Barcelona's style of play more than any of the other suitors. The Englishman, who netted 22 goals in 50 appearances for Tottenham in all competitions, has been in splendid form and could indeed prove to be a solution to Valverde's woes.\nVideo\nAuthor's take\nNeymar's potential migration to France will see him leave behind a big void and even bigger shoes to be filled on the left of Barcelona's famed attack. While Dele Alli will undoubtedly relish the opportunity to play alongside Lionel Messi for one of the best teams in the world, it is a completely different matter of whether he will be able to cope and succeed at that level.\nCould MSN really transition to MSA? Only time will tell.\n"

S'GRENOBLE: Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps. Daniel Roche, who has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery lately.\n"I had never found any significant human remains before," he said. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\nIn January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people. Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines.\nRoche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.\n"These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.\n"They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say".\nJust 10 days ago, two bodies were found lying near each other, preserved in a receding glacier in the Diablerets massif in the Swiss Alps.\nA DNA search identified the couple as Marcelin Dumoulin, a 40-year-old shoemaker at the time, and his wife Francine, a schoolteacher aged 37, who had disappeared in the Alps 75 years before.\n'

S' CHENNAI: Two masked burglars broke into the house of a retired railway employee and made away with at least five sovereigns of gold chain and Rs 5,000. The chain was snatched from a 92-year-old woman sleeping alone at the third floor of her house, while her family members were sleeping at the first and second floor at the same house. Rs 5,000 in cash were taken from the safe. \n When the started moving down to the first floor in search of more valuables, inmates raised an alarm. The burglars aborted their bid and fled the spot with the booty. \n  Based on a complaint of the retired railway staff Hari Krishnan, 62, the Ayanavaram police registered a case and launched a hunt for the suspects. Hari Krishnan stayed at one of the rooms on the first floor, while his mother Annammal, 92, continued to stay on the third floor after the demise of her husband Ramasamy a decade ago. \n  During inquiry, Hari Krishnan told police that the two burglars were wearing masks to cover up their faces. Police suspected that the burglars may have known to the family and that was the reason, they have used masks. Police personnel have collected CCTV footages from some of the nearby apartments and shops to trace the suspects. \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S'1H Marker: Russia On Track To A Weak Recovery In 2017'

S'A quick top level update on the Russian economy from Bofit and Fitch Ratings.\nFitch Ratings today:\n"The recovery in Russia continues to gain traction. Domestic demand is responding to greater confidence in the economic policy framework, particularly as the inflation-targeting regime becomes entrenched. Activity in Turkey has bounced back rapidly from the coup attempt, with growth hitting 5% yoy in 1Q17. Momentum was supported by government incentives, including temporary fiscal measures and a jump in the Treasury commitment to the fund that backs lending to SMEs."\nChart from BOFIT confirms the above:\nOverall, the recovery is still on track, and remains gradual at best, posing elevated risks of reversals. For example, industrial output, having previously posted gains in January-May 2017, contracted in June 2017 on a quarterly basis. Still, industrial output was up 2% in 1H 2017 y/y. Despite the U.S. and European sanctions, and generally adverse trends in the commodities sectors, mineral extraction sector expanded 3% y/y in 1H 2017, according to BOFIT. Oil output was up 2% and gas output was up 13%. The above figures imply that higher value added manufacturing posted sub-1% y/y growth in 1H 2017.\nAgricultural production was basically flat - due, in part, to poor weather conditions, rising only 0.2% y/y in 1H 2017 and unlikely to post significant growth for FY2017 as crop reports are coming in relatively weak. That said, 2015-2016 saw record crops and very strong growth in agricultural output, so barring a major decline this year, agricultural sector activity will remain robust. Food production sector was the fourth highest growth sector over the 2013-1H 2017 period across the entire Russian economy, rising cumulative 17% in 1H 2017 compared to 1H 2013 in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.\nConstruction sector posted a robust 4-5 percent expansion in 1H 2017 compered to 1H 2016, a rather positive sign of improving investment.\nPharmaceuticals (+36%), plastics (+25%), chemical industry (+22%), paper industry (+19%) were the main sectors of positive growth over 2013-2017 period, according to data compiled by Rossstat.\nReally good news is that household demand is now recovering. Retail sales by volume were up ca 1% y/y on a seasonally-adjusted basis and real disposable household income rose from the cycle lows to the levels last seen in May-June 2016. Bad news is that with income growth slower than retail sales and even slower than actual household consumption (which grew faster than domestic retail sales due to accelerating purchases abroad), Russian households are dipping into savings and credit to fund consumption increases.\nWe shall wait until July 2017 PMI figures come out over the next few days to see more current trends in the Russian economy, but overall, all signs point to a moderate 1H and 3Q (ongoing) expansion in the economy, consistent with 1.2-1.3% real growth. The Economy Ministry recently reiterated its view that Russian GDP will expand at more than 2% rate in 2017. Achieving this will clearly require a large and accelerated cut in the central bank rate from current 9% to below 8%. Even with this, it is hard to see how above-2% growth can be achieved.\nAgricultural and food production are quite significant variable in the growth equation. In 2016, Russia became number one exporter of wheat in the world, with annual production tipping 120 million tons - historical record. Bad weather conditions in 2017 mean that current expected output is estimated at around 17% below 2016 levels. Russia consumes 70 percent of its wheat output internally, so cuts to exports are likely to be on the magnitude of 1/2 or more in 2017. Domestically, food price inflation is rising this year, threatening overall central bank target and putting pressure on CBR to stay out of cutting the key policy rate. Inflation rose in June to 4.4% - moderate by historical standards, but above 4% CBR target.\n'

S"Image Credit: Sebastian Blanco\n  2018 Volt \nImage Credit: Sebastian Blanco\nGeneral Motors is apparently considering killing off six slow-selling models by 2020, according to Reuters. But is that really likely? The news is mentioned in a story where UAW president Dennis Williams notes that slumping US car sales could threaten jobs at low-volume factories. Still, we're skeptical that GM is really serious about killing those cars.\nReuters specifically calls out the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Sonic, and the Chevrolet Volt. Most of these have been redesigned or refreshed within the past few model years. Four - the LaCrosse, Impala, CT6, and Volt - are built in the Hamtramck factory in Detroit. That plant has made only 35,000 cars this year - down 32 percent from 2016. A typical GM plant builds 200,000-300,000 vehicles a year.\n Of all the cars Williams listed, killing the XTS, Impala, and Sonic make the most sense. They're older and don't sell particularly well. On the other hand, axing the other three seems like an odd move. It would leave Buick and Cadillac without flagship sedans, at least until the rumored Cadillac CT8 arrives. The CT6 was a big investment for GM and backing out after just a few years would be a huge loss. It also uses GM's latest and best materials and technology, making us even more skeptical.\n The Volt is a hugely important car for Chevrolet, and supplementing it with a crossover makes more sense than replacing it with one. Offering one model with a range of powertrain variants like the Hyundai Ioniq and Toyota Prius might be another route GM could take.\n All six of these vehicles are sedans, Yes, crossover sales are booming, but there's still a huge market for cars. Backing away from these would be essentially giving up sales to competitors from around the globe. The UAW might simply be publicly pushing GM to move crossover production to Hamtramck to avoid closing the plant and laying off workers.\nSales of passenger cars are down across both GM and the industry. Consolidating production in other plants and closing Hamtramck rather than having a single facility focus on sedans might make more sense from a business perspective. GM is also trying to reduce its unsold inventory, meaning current production may be slowed or halted while current cars move into customer hands.\n There's a lot of politics that goes into building a car. GM wants to do what makes the most sense from a business perspective, while the UAW doesn't workers to lose their jobs when a factory closes. When these two desires don't line up, there's always a lot of rumors, and speculation. For now, the automaker is remaining mum on its future products, as we'd expect.\n"

S'STORY HIGHLIGHTS\nPolice in east London arrested one person after violence broke out at a protest over the death of a man who had been detained a week earlier, police said on Saturday.\nRashan Charles, 20, died on July 22 after he was chased by a police officer who attempted to remove an object from his mouth or throat, according to an independent body which deals with complaints about the police.\nA protest over his death in the borough of Hackney turned violent on Friday night when bottles and other objects were thrown at officers and small fires were started, police said.\nWindows of local businesses and cars were damaged and police in riot gear and some on horseback were called in to help clear the area. BBC television showed what appeared to be fireworks exploding near police officers.\nThe person arrested was a 17-year-old male who was held on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, police said. No one was seriously injured during the disturbance, they said.\nThe BBC said some protesters carried Black Lives Matter placards.\nA further protest was planned for Saturday in the same area, police said.\nBritain\'s Independent Police Complaints Commission has said it will investigate "thoroughly and rigorously" the incidents that led to Charles\' death. CCTV camera footage show him being wrestled to the ground by a police officer in a shop. Then the officer appears to try to remove something from Charles\' mouth.\nThe IPCC is also investigating the death of another man who was stopped by police in June in another area of east London. An examination of his body found packages in his throat.\nLondon was hit by a series of major riots in the summer of 2011 after police shot dead a man who was a known criminal. An inquest found that police acted lawfully in that case.\n'

S"From brown rice and amaranth to farro and wheat berries, here's an alphabetical guide to cooking every whole grain.\nWe all love a grain bowl\xe2\x80\x94they're delicious, healthy, imminently photo-worthy, and, of course, filling. But sometimes figuring out how to cook whole grains in order to make said grain bowl can feel intimidating. What's the water to grain ratio for millet again? And how long do you need to simmer your farro?\nHerewith, a guide that tells you exactly how to cook whole grains\xe2\x80\x94from amaranth to wild rice\xe2\x80\x94using the old-fashioned, cover-and-simmer method. A few notes: We proceed alphabetically, beginning with amaranth and ending with wild rice. All the directions below call for water, but of course you could use stock instead if you prefer. Salt the water if you want\xe2\x80\x94about half a teaspoon per cup of grain.\nAmaranth\nBring 3 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 cup amaranth, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed.\nBrown rice\nBring 2 cups water and 1 cup brown rice to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the water is absorbed, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes and then fluff with a fork.\nBuckwheat\nBring 2 cups water and 1 cup buckwheat to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer\xe2\x80\x9410 minutes for cracked kasha, 30 minutes for whole kasha.\nBulgur\nBring 2 cups water and 1 cup medium-grain bulgur to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 10 to 12 minutes.\nCorn\nIt's a whole grain too! See this guide for how to make perfect popcorn and this recipe for perfect corn on the cob.\nFarro\nBring 1 cup farro and 3 cups water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes.\nFreekeh\nBring 1 cup of freekeh and 2 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, until liquid is absorbed.\nKamut\nSoak the kamut overnight in water, then drain. Bring 1 cup kamut and 2 cups water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the berries are tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.\nMillet\nBring 2 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add millet, stir, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.\nOats\nRolled oats: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 cup oats, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nSteel-cut oats: Bring 3 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 cup oats, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook\xe2\x80\x94stirring occasionally\xe2\x80\x9410 to 20 minutes, depending on desired consistency.\nQuinoa\nRinse the quinoa first and drain it in a sieve. Bring 1 cup quinoa and 1 1/4 cups water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer 10 minutes. Let stand off the heat 5 minutes and then fluff with a fork.\nRye berries\nSoak 1 cup rye berries in 2 1/2 cups water overnight. When you're ready to cook, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 1 hour.\nSorghum\nBring 1 cup sorghum berries and 3 cups water to a boil over high heat. Cover to pot, reduce heat, and simmer until the berries are tender and the liquid is absorbed, 50 to 60 minutes.\nSpelt\nSoak 1 cup spelt berries in water overnight; drain. Bring 3 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add drained spelt berries, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 45 to 60 minutes, until the berries are tender.\nTeff\nBring 4 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 cup teff, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nWheat berries\nSoak 1 cup wheat berries in water overnight, then drain. Add to a pot with 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes, until water is absorbed and the berries are tender.\nWild rice\nCombine 1 cup wild rice with 3 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 45 to 55 minutes, until water is absorbed and rice is tender.\nThe Absolute Easiest Way to Cook Any Whole Grain\nHere's a little secret about how to cook whole grains: it doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, instead of measuring and memorizing ratios, there's a really simple way to cook literally any grain: just boil some water, add your grain, and then cook until it's done. That's it!\nLet's say you're cooking farro. Bring a big pot of water to a boil, like you would with pasta. Salt it if you want. Get some farro\xe2\x80\x94no need to measure it. Just use however much you think you want. Add it to the pot of boiling water.\nKeeping the pot at a pretty brisk boil, cook the farro until it's done, and then drain it through a fine-mesh sieve. How do you know it's done? You taste it. Does it taste good\xe2\x80\x94tender, yet still on the al dente side? Bam: done. Obviously this method requires a little more supervision than the cover-and-steam method, but in my opinion it more than makes up for that by giving you complete control over the process\xe2\x80\x94you'll never again take the lid off your pot of rice and find yourself surprised that it's under- or overcooked.\n"

S" Forest Ministers of various states, including Assam, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Odisha today said the Tiger Reserves and wildlife sanctuaries were in a bad shape and demanded the Centre to provide them with more funds.The Ministers narrated the challenges faced by them at the Global Tiger Day celebration at Vigyan Bhawan here, where Union Minister of Environment and Forest Harsh Vardhan was the chief guest.According to Assam Forest Minister Rani Brahma, there are four Tiger Reserves in Assam, comprising around 50 per cent of the total tiger population in the country. She said the State Government is taking steps to increase it to 76 per cent in the coming years, adding that the State Government was doing its best to provide a conducive environment to the animals.Uttarakhand Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat stressed on research on new farming techniques and ways, so as to benefit the ryots. He further urged the Government to provide more money for increasing the grass cover of the state. Mr Rawat also demanded setting up of a surveillance system in the forest areas of Uttarakhand, so as to arrest poachers and illegal activities.Forest Minister of Madhya Pradesh Gauri Shankar Shejwar said the State Government has taken various steps to increase the population of tigers, which has shown an upward trend in the last eight years. ''We have increased tiger population by almost 40 per cent in the last eight years and intend to increase it further to 60 per cent in the coming years,'' he added. According to Odisha Forest and Environment Minister Bijayshree Routray, the state is using camera tap technique, to get a hold of tiger population. He demanded giving a free hand to the Police and Forest Departments of the state, to save the forests and animals. Malenistic Tiger, commonly known as Black Tiger, which is a rare animal, is only found in Odisha, he added. UNI RJ SNU 1942\n"

S'Ciaran McMeeken had more than 50 songs to choose from when he started recording his self-titled debut album.\nCiaran McMeeken, a great southern man from Arrowtown, can thank the owner of a farm in Owaka Valley for encouraging him to pursue his musical dreams.\nWhile working for the farmer, named John, in 2013, his boss asked him what he wanted to do with his life. McMeeken didn\'t have an answer at the time, to which the response was "just get on with it mate". Two EPS later and now with the release of his self-titled debut album, McMeeken has done just that.\n What are you plugging right now? \nI am all set to release my debut full-length album, and for the first time I\'m actually really excited about it! I have been working on this album for more than two-and-a-half years and wrote more than 50 songs, so it feels really good to be finally sharing it with the world.\nIn the past I\'ve been rather nervous about releasing music and what people are going to think and all that usual stuff. With this album, however, I feel really at ease with it all. I feel really confident and I believe whole-heartedly that we have put together a really awesome collection of songs that touch on all different facets and emotions of life. I\'m really proud of it.\nI remember a few months back trying to come up with an album name. I had options such as Which Way Shall We Go? (which I liked), I had Rhino Peak (which I have now called my business) and I even went as far as seriously considering Eat The Strawberries as a possible name. I called up my dad one afternoon and he completely pulled me back down to earth and said: "Ciaran, I have listened to this album countless times now and these songs are so dynamic and diverse that you can\'t possibly call the album anything. No title can possibly encapsulate these songs that you have written. Keep it really simple mate, You have written these songs, put an image of your face as the artwork and call it Ciaran McMeeken. Done." \nThanks Dad, I\'ll do just that. There\'s nothing like a grounded conversation with the old man to set things straight.\nREAD MORE:\nHow did you initially get involved in music and how long have you been part of it? \nI initially got into music when I was 11. In 2003 I moved from Arrowtown to Dunedin with my family and attended Balmacewen Intermediate. At the time I was heavily into sports, particularly athletics and rugby.\nBalmacewen have a policy where every student must learn to play a musical instrument, so I decided on drums. I loved it and picked it up quickly. I was lucky to be in a class with two lads, Innes and Conall (Hearty Irish names) who happened to play bass and guitar. We started hanging out and playing music together, mainly Nirvana and Guns N\' Roses covers.\nA year later my parents bought me an acoustic guitar and a boy called Patrick (adding to the Irish flavour) joined the band as the drummer. So this was the band moving forward and we played together throughout high school, won school battle of the bands and entered Rockquests etc.\nI also spent a lot of time playing in a country duo, a reggae band and also busking with a friend over Christmas. This was the foundation of my music life. \nWhat\'s your idea of perfect happiness?\nFor me perfect happiness is when I know deep within myself that I am enough and I am worthy at every moment of every day in any situation. Not relying on external things or sources to fill a void within. At the moment I am practising meditating, focusing on the positive and breaking down barriers that have been in the way of living an extraordinary, epic life!\nWhich living person do you most admire?\nJack Johnson. I admire him for the success he has achieved in his music career but also for what he is doing in the community. He is heavily involved with charities, fundraising events, and projects to do with the environment. He also has awesome initiatives on his world tours opting for plastic free, supporting local food and using sustainable bio-diesel for the trucks they use etc! It\'s bloody awesome and something I am working towards for myself!\nWhat\'s your most embarrassing moment?\nMy most embarrassing moment is most likely not appropriate for publication but my close second would be getting stage fright at an open mic in Sydney a few years ago. I was so nervous, bright red, sweaty and shaky but somehow managed to stumble my way through Skinny Love. After I finished the song, someone yelled out "Boooooo!". I walked off stage feeling like a piece of crap. The worst part is that it was all being filmed by some students for a community project and they wanted to do an interview straight afterward. So with a camera pointed at my shiny, awkward face the first question they asked was, "So how was that? How are you feeling?". I remember being totally honest and saying something along the lines of "that was one of the worst moments of my life".\nEver stolen anything? \nYes, I stole a George Foreman grill and Ministry of Sound CD from a flat party once. I\'m deeply ashamed of that.\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\nIf I\'m totally honest, I have a hairy back of my neck. I\'m really self-conscious of it and I shave it every day! The thought of going tramping for a week without a razor actually gives me anxiety! Crazy! It\'s just blimmin\' hair for goodness sake!\nWhat life lesson would you pass on to your children?\nThe power of vulnerability. I will really instil into them that it is OK to be lost, depressed, jealous or insecure. It\'s OK to feel anything. You have to lean into the discomfort and communicate whatever it is you are feeling. I truly believe the reason we have such a high suicide rate in this country is because most of us don\'t have tools to communicate or listen properly. All we really need emotionally, as human beings, are to be seen, heard, accepted and not judged. To be able to put your hand up to a friend or family member and actually say. "Hey, I\'m feeling really insecure, anxious and depressed at the moment", takes incredible courage. What we then need is for the friend or partner to say, "Thank you so much for being authentic with me, I love you and I\'m totally and utterly here for you." This type of communication is very rare and is something that needs education and attention in our schools, community groups, and families. For me, I have been really fortunate to have had such supportive parents. When I went through a deep depression about four years ago, they were there for me. I learned a lot from songwriting and expressing my thoughts and feelings through writing and music. It was a huge help to me. I have now learned to do that in conversations with friends and family, which keeps me healthy and allows me to function in this world.\nHow do you balance music with other obligations \xe2\x80\x93 partner, children, job? \nWell at the moment I don\'t have any of those things. In my past relationships, I have definitely found myself out of balance from time to time and it\'s something I am aware of and working on. Pursuing a life in music really is a huge commitment. I absolutely love it. There are just a lot of sacrifices and compromises that need to be made to make it work. For example, I have missed out on countless trips away with family and friends because I need to save money for music stuff or I have a tour etc. Having a career in music is like having a child, you really have to look after it and give it a huge portion of your time and energy to enable it to survive and grow. \nWhat do you do to relax? \nI love to go running to clear the lungs and mind. It keeps me sane. I love to practice yoga too, it really centres me, leaving my mind and body feeling clear and free. I also love to read and cook healthy vegan food.\nWhat job would you do other than your own and why?\nI\'d be a healthy food critic. I\'d be paid to fly around the world visiting healthy and organic cafes/restaurants and try all of their awesome food. I don\'t know if this exists but I\'d make it work somehow.\n'

S'In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\nNew Delhi: Has a Swiss expeditioner stumbled upon the remains of a mysterious 1966 air crash that killed Homi J Bhabha, the father of India\'s nuclear programme?\n That question would interest many in India after reports said Swiss climber Daniel Roche, who has a hobby of combing the Alps for remains of old plane crashes, reported that he came across the remains of an Air India crash on Mont Blanc either from 1966 or from 1954.\n "I had never found any significant human remains before," Roche told AFP. This time, however, he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.\n In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blanc\'s summit, killing all 117 people on board. Another Air India flight crashed on the mountain in 1950, killing 48 people.\n Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the plane\'s four jet engines. \n If the remains are indeed from the Boeing 707 crash of the Bombay-Geneva Kangchenjunga aircraft, it means he has traced the crash that killed India\'s pioneering nuclear scientist.\n The official cause of the crash has always been cited as the misunderstanding between the pilot and the Geneva Airport about the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position. Conspiracy theories, however, including a CIA assassination plot, abound.\n A book titled Conversations with the Crow, which contains the transcripts of journalist Gregory Douglas\xe2\x80\x99s interview with former CIA operative Robert Crowley claimed the CIA got rid of Bhabha to \xe2\x80\x9cparalyse\xe2\x80\x9d India\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear programme. \n Crowley claims it was a bomb in the cargo section of the aircraft which brought it down in the Alps. \n The remains found by Daniel Roche will now be examined by experts. \n According to the local police, the hand and leg found by Roche may not be from the same person. "These remains are probably not from the same person," said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie. "They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, it\'s difficult to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S" First impression matters a lot in the business world. You should be aware of this important fact and dress properly. Corporate uniforms or business attire has been there in the business world for many years. But there have been a lot of changes in the last 20 years and it is good for the business. Styles and designs have changed keeping in mind the taste of today's world. But the big question is why formal attire or corporate wear is so important for the growth of business? The most important reason why corporate wear is so important for a company is because it gives a clear message that you are dedicated to your company and position in which you are working. You love your brand and want to project it in front of your clients and want to make it engraved in their minds. Even clients love the work culture and ambience when they see the employees or workers in formal attire. On the other hand, if you were to walk into an office and see one employee in torn jeans and a stained shirt and another person in a sleek \nbusiness suit, you would assume that the one in the jeans is not serious about his job. It is true that first impressions matters a lot and it can affect the fortunes of your company.\nThere is no doubt that corporate uniforms enhance professionalism in the workplace. The biggest advantage is that all the employees feel equal in formal attire and this sense of equality boosts confidence and spreads professionalism in the organization. The idea of professionalism varies from company to company. But the correlation between the two is generally strong. Some business organizations prefer to allow employees to dress freely or casually for more comfort, which works well in more creative work environments such as advertising agencies. However, companies in which employees routinely interact with prospects, clients and business partners on a daily basis typically need a dress code to maintain a professional image and showcase their brand. In real estate, employees dress in formal attire to represent their company and also sell their brand well in the targeted market. Corporate wear encourages positivity and also create good vibes not only in the company but also instills faith in the clients. If you are able to build faith in the clients, then it will result in more business for you.\nIf you are looking for corporate attire for your company, then you should shop online. You can easily find many uniform manufacturers and suppliers in Delhi, India. Log on to any popular website of a uniform supplier and visit their display section. You can check all the details of the displayed products and buy according to your taste and budget. You can also tell them about your specifications and then ask them to customize your work wear. A reliable uniform T-shirt manufacturer will cater to your needs keeping in mind your competitors and other aspects. If you are in need of hotel uniform, hospital uniform, industry uniform, security uniforms and other formal attire, you can find easily on online stores. You can place bulk orders with corporate shirts manufacturer and they will deliver your dress within the given time frame. When you shop with them, you will get great customer service, great offers, and discounts round the year. So, go for corporate uniforms to boost your image and also productivity. \n"

S"Location: Utah\n Established: November 19, 1919\n Size: 148,733 acres\nRising in Utah's high plateau country, the Virgin River carves its way to the desert below through a gorge so deep and narrow that sunlight rarely penetrates to the bottom. As the canyon widens, the river runs past great palisade walls rimmed with slickrock peaks and hanging valleys.\nA million years of flowing water has cut through the red and white beds of Navajo sandstone that form the sheer walls of Zion. The geologic heart of the canyon began as a vast desert millions of years ago; almost incessant winds blew one dune on top of another until the sands reached a depth of more than 2,000 feet. You can still see the track of these ancient winds in the graceful crossbedded strata of Zion's mighty cliffs.\nUnlike the Grand Canyon where you stand on the rim and look out, Zion Canyon is usually viewed from the bottom looking up. The vertical topography confines most of Zion's 2.5 million yearly visitors between canyon walls.\nStreamside on the canyon floor grow thick stands of Fremont cottonwood, box elder, willow, and, a short distance away, cactus and Utah juniper. Vegetation changes rapidly as the terrain rises almost a mile in elevation. The high plateaus support Douglas fir and ponderosa pine.\nWithin the park's 232 square miles lies a landscape of remote terraces and narrow gorges. A number of these canyons are so hidden that early surveyors overlooked some that are 20 miles long. More than 100 miles of wilderness trails crisscross the backcountry, while 15 miles of paved trails encourage casual visits.\nDid You Know?\nAs the intersection of three separate ecosystems, Zion has a variety of plants\xe2\x80\x94more than 900 species\xe2\x80\x94not found anywhere else in Utah. The 287.4-foot-long Kolob Arch, perched high on a canyon wall in the park's backcountry, is one of the world's largest freestanding natural arches. In 1920, Zion National Park had 3,692 visitors. In 1998, the park had 2.7 million visitors.\n Copy for this series includes excerpts from the National Geographic Guide to the National Parks of the United States, Seventh Edition, 2012, and the National Parks series featured in National Geographic Traveler. \n"

S"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]\nGet the Recipes\nIt's that time of year again, when we move into the land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. No, not the Twilight Zone\xe2\x80\x94early spring. The thought of fresh fruit is so ripe in my mind I can taste it, but the farmers market is still bare. It's the perfect excuse for a bit of spring cleaning, a baking spree to polish off the last of the frozen fruit I squirrel away every summer. \nNow, you can make a lot of desserts with frozen fruit, but my favorite option is pie. Despite what you might have read elsewhere, frozen fruit isn't any juicier than fresh, so it doesn't take any special precautions to prepare. There's no need to drain off the juices or add extra starch\xe2\x80\x94simply thaw to about 50\xc2\xb0F (10\xc2\xb0C), and prepare the pie filling as directed. \nThe frozen fruit will deflate and release its water content as it thaws, so it will seem juicier. But looks can be deceiving. It's the same amount of liquid you'd find in fresh fruit; it just shows up a lot earlier in the process. That does give the pie filling a denser, jammier vibe\xe2\x80\x94compared to a pie made with plump fresh fruits that wilt and release their juices only after spending some time in the oven\xe2\x80\x94but it doesn't mean pies made with frozen fruit will be a soupy mess.\nOn the left, a pie made with fresh cherries; on the right, a pie made with frozen cherries.\nThe only thing to keep in mind when baking a pie with frozen fruit is that it may warrant an extra 10 or 15 minutes in the oven, unless you thaw the fruit all the way to room temperature. For that reason, I don't like to egg-wash frozen-fruit pies, as that extra time in the oven can lead to excessive browning, even with a foil shield. \nOn the plus side, more time in the oven generally translates into an even crispier bottom crust\xe2\x80\x94at least with my pie dough recipe, which is high in both butter and water, factors that help the crust crisp, puff, and resist absorbing moisture from the filling. Low-fat and/or low-moisture pie doughs tend to be thirsty, meaning they're more inclined to soak up a juicy filling, particularly when the dough is raw. With some doughs, that means baking with frozen fruit can lead to a soggy crust, so you may want to consider switching to a richer, more hydrated dough for the occasion.\nSo join me in the middle ground between science and superstition, between the (cherry) pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge\xe2\x80\x94frozen fruit in a fresh-baked pie.\n"

p4564

S'Spread across 285 acres of green and incredibly biodiverse land, the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve is located in Sungam hills, between Nelliyampathy and Anamalai ranges. While the Nelliyampathy hills are not very high and are only visible from the northern part of the reserve, the peaks in Anamalai hills go as high as 1,438m. These include Karimala Gopuram, Vengoli Malai, Puliyarapadam and Pandaravarai.\nThe Parambikulam Tiger Reserve was established in the 1960s. The forests were heavily exploited for their vast reserves of timber in the early 1900s. However, in the 1950s, the government of the newly independent state of India, Kerala, abolished the tramways that had been set up by the British for easier transport of teak. The government also prohibited tree-cutting. Today, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve is a highly protected forest area.\nThe main attraction here, for which most tourists make the long trip to the sanctuary, are the big cats \xe2\x80\x93 leopards and tigers. Not everyone gets a glimpse of these glorious jungle cats, although, on rare occasions, they are known to pop by the small coffee shop near the Parambikulam bus stand to reveal themselves to the loud and colourful human beings. But for those who are spared of this hair-raising, highly adrenaline-pumping experience, other mammals such as bears, elephants, macaques and flying squirrels make the experience of tourists worthwhile.\nThe sanctuary also attracts over 120 kinds of butterflies, of which 34 are endemic to the region, and 134 species of birds, of which 18 are endangered. Neem, teak and sandalwood trees populate most of the forests. The oldest tree here is the majestic Kannimara Teak, believed to be 450 years old. This abundant and thriving population of flora and fauna in the sanctuary co-exists peacefully with the four indigenous tribes: Kadar, Malasar, Mala Malasar and Muduvar.\nA machan inside the reserve\nORIENTATION\nParambikulam Tiger Reserve lies south of the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, between the hills of Anamalai and Nelliyampathy. Its altitude ranges from 980\xe2\x80\x934,600ft. The sanctuary has no direct roads connecting it with towns in Kerala, and must be accessed from Pollachi in Tamil Nadu. There is a certain amount of grunt work involved in getting here, as tourists will have to negotiate with the forest departments of both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The latter manage the Indira Gandhi National Park at Anamalai (Entry Rs. 15), which has to be navigated to get to Parambikulam. The Annapadi checkpost, 10km from the Anamalai Sanctuary, marks the transition from Tamil Nadu to Kerala, and the beginning of the Parambikulam reserve area.\nTHINGS TO SEE AND DO\nParambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary\nTourism at the sanctuary is carefully monitored and visitors are only allowed inside with an experienced forest guide. Eco-tourism activities in Parambikulam include night-stays, trekking, camps and nature-education trails. All of these are organised by the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. Contact the Forest Information or Wildlife Interpretation Centre at Annapadi for guides.\nIt is a good idea to get there as early as possible, as animals are most active at this time of the day. One should also ideally come in a vehicle, as moving around on foot is difficult inside the park.\nIt is possible to stay within the sanctuary. The reserve offers a large number of accommodation options, which are basic. However, staying here for a night is quite a wonderful experience; wild animals come out to drink on the far side of the lake in the evenings. As night falls over the forests, a sort of stillness envelops the sanctuary, disturbed only by the cries of owls and the occasional roar of a tiger. On cold winter nights, the sanctuary\xe2\x80\x99s many hotels offer the pleasurable experience of sitting by a fire and feasting on simple, but delicious and hot food.\nThe well-maintained Parambikulam Dam on the Parambiar river\nFor day trips, however, please remember that the gates close at 6.00pm, after which no vehicles are permitted in or out of the sanctuary. Private tour companies also arrange for trips and tours to the sanctuary.\nEntry \xe2\x82\xb9170 Timings 7.00am\xe2\x80\x936.00pm Vehicle fee \xe2\x82\xb925\xe2\x80\x9380 Cell 09442201690 Email infoatecocare@gmail.com, parambikulamsanctuary@gmail.com W parambikulam.org/\nKannimara Teak \nOne of the oldest and largest teak trees in the world, this 450-year-old tree is 6.57m wide and 48.5m high. This tree is the remnant of the wild teak which grew in the area before the teak plantations came up. The central government had bestowed the Mahavriksha Puraskar upon the Kannimara Teak in 1994\xe2\x80\x9395, declaring it a healthy, historical and valuable tree. Situated 7km from Thunakkadavu, the route itself offers plenty of sights and sounds. There is a vayal (marshy grassland) on the way, where herbivores such as deer, sambar and gaur can be usually seen in large numbers.\nTrekking Trails\nThe Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, with its hilly terrain, peaks and valleys, offers a large number of trekking trails for adventure seekers. Peaks such as Karimala Gopuram (4,718ft) and Vengoli peak (3,675ft) are favourites of visitors and not very difficult to climb. Treks also afford sightings of highly endangered animals such as the Nilgiri tahr, although it is more likely to spot tahr droppings.\nSeven eco-development committees have been set up by the forest department in Parambikulam, to bring the benefits of tourism to the indigenous tribal communities. Visitors must get permission to trek from the Forest Information Centre at Annapadi, and hire a tribal guide; one guide can accompany groups of up to five people, while larger groups will need to hire more guides. Fees range from \xe2\x82\xb950\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x82\xb9100 per head based on the difficulty of the trek. Routes can also be selected inside the forest, with overnight stays in machans and watchtowers. Birders will love these treks, as they offer the opportunity to spot up to 268 avian species.\nDams and Reservoirs\nThe three dams \xe2\x80\x93 Parambikulam, Thunakkadavu and Peruvaripallam \xe2\x80\x93 are all located inside the sanctuary on the Parambiar river. Rowboats can be hired for boating at Thunakkadavu and Parambikulam. Mugger crocodiles are often spotted in the water or sunning themselves on the banks.\nBoating fee \xe2\x82\xb9100 per hour\nWHERE TO STAY\nThe day\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Parambikulam come to a standstill by six in the evening, when the chains are drawn across key points on the roads and all traffic is halted. The pathways belong to fireflies and other creatures of the night. This is the time to relax on the lakeshore with steaming cups of hot tea.\nThe Forest Department Inspection Bungalow (Information Centre at Annapadi Cell: 09442201690/ 91; Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb9900), located at Thunak-kadavu, overlooks the reservoir.\nThe bungalow has attached bathrooms and hot water is provided on request. A cook is also available.\nThere are two tree-top huts with attached bathrooms, one each at Thunakkadavu (Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb93,850\xe2\x80\x935,500 per couple) and Parambikulam (Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb92,750\xe2\x80\x933,300 per couple). The tree-top huts also overlook the beautiful reservoir.\nThere is also the Bison Valley Lodge (Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb9200 per person) at Parambikulam, with three double rooms, each with an attached bath.\nA special stay option in this area is the Vettikunnu Island Nest Cottages (Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb98,250\xe2\x80\x938,800) situated on the Parambikulam reservoir, accessible only by boat. The cottages accommodate five people. The tariff includes boat charges and guide fee. Food must be carried from Parambikulam, though you can also cook food at Vettikunnu.\nAll the above should be reserved in advance via the Information Centre.\nAnother option is the PWD Inspection Bungalow (Tel: 04253-277223; Tariff: \xe2\x82\xb9300) located at Thunnakadavu. It has five rooms, each of which are well furnished and have attached bathrooms. The cook-cum-caretaker will arrange meals for you, although you can get meals at the several restaurants and canteens located in the vicinity. There is also a watchtower situated near the bungalow for the beautiful views of the forest around.\nWHERE TO EAT\nMost hotels in Parambikulam have restaurants, canteens or kitchens. At some places, such as the cottages on Vettikunnu island, overlooking the Parambikulam reservoir, tourists have to prepare their own meals. Other than these, there are a few local eateries around the reserve, which offer basic South Indian food such as idli and dosa for breakfast, and spicy fish fry and chicken curry for lunch and dinner. The Honey Comb Restaurant at the Treetop Huts offers excellent fare as well.\nGETTING THERE\nState Kerala\nLocation In Palakkad District; within the Western Ghats; contiguous with the Anamalai Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu.

S' They could either be of people who died in the 1950 crash or in the 1966 one. \nDaniel Roche/AFP\nA man with a peculiar hobby has claimed he found body parts of passengers who died in one of two Air India plane crashes from more than 50 years ago in the French Alps, AFP reported on Friday. Daniel Roche, who has spent years looking for remains in the Bossons Glacier on the Mont Blanc peak, made the discovery on Thursday.\nRoche found a human hand and the upper part of a leg. \xe2\x80\x9cI had never found any significant human remains before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nIn 1950, an Air India flight carrying 48 people had crashed in the French Alps. In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 heading to New York from Mumbai had crashed near Mont Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s summit. All 117 people on board had died. \nRoche said the remains could be of a female passenger from the 1966 crash. He also discovered one of the plane\xe2\x80\x99s four jet engines (pictured above).\nThe aviation enthusiast contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix Valley on making the discoveries, which will now be examined by experts. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThese remains are probably not from the same person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephane Bozon, a local official. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are probably from passengers, but between the two aircraft, it is difficult to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

S'The Surprising Reason Millennials Check Their Phones 150 Times a Day'

S'A new study by Qualtrics and Accel found that Millennials prefer digital communication. (Many even check their phones once per night.) Scientists know why, but do we really understand the benefits?\nCREDIT: Getty Images\nHas technology improved your life?\nA new study this month found that over half (or 52%) of Millennials think technology has improved their relationships. And, 91% say they have a healthy relationship with tech. Interestingly enough, the same study found that most Boomers (57%) say tech has "ruined" relationships. The study by Qualtrics and Accel sheds new light on how tech plays a role in the daily lives of those 18 to 32 as opposed to older generations.\nA surprising stat from last year found that Millennials check their phone 150 times per day. What are they really trying to find out? What\'s the motivation? We\'ve known since at least 2012 that those text messages, social media posts, and emails all contribute to the release of dopamine in the human brain. (It\'s the same neurotransmitter that rewards you for accomplishing a goal.)\nScientists have wondered whether this is a terrible trend. Entire books have explained how an obsessive compulsion to read text messages and check your Twitter status have created zombies who can\'t really participate in discussions and can\'t look you in the eye for more than a second. Most of us have experienced that problem.\nThe truth is a little more complicated, however.\nWhat the Qualtric and Accel survey reveals is that tech has, at least in the minds of Millennials, fostered better relationships both in daily life and at work. 73% of Millennials say tech has given them a better work-life balance, contributing to a better understanding on projects, for example, or building better friendships outside of work. In the same test group, which was about 8,000 respondents globally, only 47% of older generations said tech has given them a better work-life balance and improved relationships.\nI\'ve seen how this plays out firsthand many times. Working with Millennials is an interesting experience these days because they do not communicate as often by making phone calls or meeting in person. Yet, they communicate more often. You know what they\'re thinking and feeling, even if you\'re reading it on a screen.\nTech has removed a barrier in relationships, lessened the delays in communication, and created a new forum for resolving conflict. We say Millennials do not have a "filter" but that has become a benefit in communication in many cases where they share true thoughts over text and on social media. It\'s not necessarily that Millennials are checked out or disinterested; in fact, they may be more clued in and more aware then ever.\nOf course, there\'s a downside.\nDopamine can create a false sense of accomplishment. The Qualtrics study found that Millennials rarely go more than five hours during waking hours without checking their phone, which is a sign of addictive behavior. 79% keep a phone nearby when they sleep, and half check their phone in the middle of the night. Scientists know what\'s happening--it\'s a sense of euphoria you feel when someone comments on your Instagram photo, but that\'s not quite the same thing as landing a new job or getting a raise.\nThere are warning signs when it comes to tech addiction, and it is a real problem. Yet, you could also say there is a shift in communication and it\'s creating better relationships that involve more communication and fewer barriers. I can text someone in seconds, but it take five minutes or more to make a phone call. As long as we understand the negatives (a false reward, not to mention a bright light shining up at your face all evening that turns you into an insomniac) it\'s possible that we\'re underestimating the benefits in this new form of communication. Tech does have benefits, as the study confirms.\nFor most of us outside of this age group, there are a few implications. One is that we\'ll need to invest ourselves in how we develop relationships with Millennials. It means more Slack, fewer meetings. It means we might get a text in the wee hours of the night. It\'s a shift in how business communication has always worked, and the great irony here is that the Millennials are way ahead of us. They are seeing the benefits. Most of us are only seeing the downside--the inability to pay attention during a meeting.\nWhat\'s your view? Are the warning signs about addiction more serious than anyone realizes? Is the dopamine hit really a false reward? Or is this all leading to a better workplace where communication is better...and digitized?\nShare your thoughts by email or on my Twitter feed.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\n'

S"Ending on a high note. \nPunjabi food, like its culture, is very hard to ignore especially in Amritsar, the golden heart of the land of butter and celebration. The flavours are just like its people, loud and in your face but in a very good way. We went on a food adventure spanning over three days in the land of the gurus and stuffed our faces with the most beautiful, delicious and rich dishes we could find on the streets of Amritsar. Read about day 1 here and day 2 here.\nDay 3\nBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. It is something we have all been taught. And so we took it literally with some authentic Amritsari kulchas. We started with Kulwant Kulcha. The place is ideal for those who like their kulcha really flaky, crisp and lightly spiced. Then there is All India Famous Kulcha Wala, which has been in business since 1989. The shop is owned by Sucha Singh ji and is managed by his son Ponty Singh. The kulcha dough is rolled into seven layers and then stuffed with aloo and paneer filling and half cooked. When someone places the order, the cook handling the tandoor applies water on one side and sticks it in the tandoor. Like Kulwant's this kulcha was flaky, crisp and subtly spiced. They also have another outlet called Kulchaland which has a more restaurant-like setup. But for me, Ashok Kulche Wala rules the Amritsari Kulcha chart with perfect spicing putting its offerings a cut above the rest (I've already described it in some detail here). One can walk in to his open kitchen and see the steps involved in making a perfect kulcha. This is what I liked best about Amritsar. The people here are open hearted and there are no secrets\xe2\x80\x94one can easily walk in to any restaurant's kitchen. Amritsaris love feeding people and the owners themselves are involved in cooking.\n The people here are open hearted and there are no secrets\xe2\x80\x94one can easily walk in to any restaurant's kitchen. \nNext up was Surjit Food Plaza at Nehru Shopping Complex, Lawrence Road. An interesting thing about Amritsar's food joints is that though some look quite modern and fancy, the food they serve is authentic and traditional. From the outside, Surjit looks like the kind of place I can't usually afford, but the food has not lost its Amritsari soul. I asked for tawa chicken pulao, which I could see being prepped from behind a big glass wall by none other than the owner, Amarjit Singh. He mixed ghee as well as butter into the chicken and then added boiled rice into the mixture. The tawa chicken pulao is garnished with ginger and coriander. The flavourful rice balances the soft pieces of chicken.They have served their food to who's who of India. They even have a picture album which one can ask for to see the pictures of celebrities dining at the restaurant. But what caught my attention was the modest beginnings of the restaurant. Starting from a small khopcha, it is full-fledged restaurant today with modern facilities.\nA foodie friend, Girish, sends me screenshots of food joints on WhatsApp all the time, often giving me valuable leads. While I was in Amritsar, he sent a screenshot of Giani Tea Stall, established in 1955. The place is famous for its breakfast dishes, especially kachoris, but since I couldn't make it in time for a morning meal I had to satisfy myself with an omelette and special spiced tea. The tea maker, Ajay, who hails from Pathankot has been working at Giani's for 15 years. I tried the spiced tea with saffron, cardamom and almonds (\xe2\x82\xb935 per cup). Next time, when I visit I will make it a point to start my day with his kachoris.\nOn the recommendation of another recommendation, we went to Pal Dhaba near Hathi Gate for lunch. We tried magaz, kharode and mutton tikka. The dishes were similar to what we had at Prakash (see here) but super delicious. The kharode, in particular, amazed me. Unlike the soupy Delhi variety, it was thick and unctuous. The pieces of goat feet are boiled in water and then added to a stock-based gravy later. It's delicious with tandoori rotis. On the table next to us, a group of people from Delhi were having mutton tikka with buttery white sesame naan. I couldn't resist ordering the same dish. The mutton tikka is again cooked in spices and served in thick gravy. The naan is so delicious that it can be savoured alone without any sauce or curry.\nThis was exactly what we were exactly waiting for\xe2\x80\x94a high note with which to end our amazing food journey. Needless to say we'll be going back for more.\n"

S"The Craziest Way to Cook Bacon So It's Simultaneously Crispy and Chewy"

p4664

S"Bacon is traditionally cooked in an oven, over the stovetop, or in a microwave, but what happens when you air-fry it? Air-what, you may be thinking? Air-frying is exactly as the name sounds. An appliance about the size of a slow cooker contains a drawer with a metal mesh bottom for the food. The appliance blows hot, dry air on food to fry it with little to no oil. This trend took 2016 by storm thanks to celebrity endorsements from Gordon Ramsay, Paula Deen, and Oprah Winfrey, so what's the dang fuss all about? I busted out a Philips Digital Airfryer ($250) and a package of bacon to find out. \nHaving no clue how to air-fry, I watched a YouTube video on how to air-fry bacon and followed these instructions. However, I ended up with steamed bacon once the cook time was complete. It resembled deli ham more than bacon, and the fat from the bacon turned translucent and gelatinous. Perhaps this is the preferred method to cook bacon in Europe, but for me, I like my bacon crispy. So I cranked up the heat and kept cooking, shaking the basket occasionally and tripling the cook time, until I ended up with perfectly caramelized strips. I'm talking evenly cooked with no burn spots. Bacon never looked better.\nBut looks can be deceiving; the taste test would reveal the bacon's true tastiness or not. Remarkably, the bacon had a thin, crisp exterior that yielded to a fatty, chewy interior. I've never had bacon quite like this. The bacon also retained its size prior to cooking and did not shrink at all. The cleanup was a breeze too. I poured the extra bacon grease into a dish for later (it too was pure fat with no black char bits that you find when cooking bacon in an oven or on a stovetop) and proceeded to scrub down the drawer, which proved to be an easy feat.\nFeeling confident about my air-frying skills, I proceeded to attempt apple chips and failed horribly. I mean, the apple chips burned and stuck into every crevice of the grid bottom. It was a nightmare to clean up with no reward of apple chips at the end. I know there's a learning curve to a new cooking device, so I'll try again. I'm dying to learn how to make french fries and fried chicken. Those will be my next attempts!\n"

S" Medical specialists, researchers and doctors are constantly in search of better and more improved treatments for the numerous disorders and diseases that affect people. Extensive research and studies are being carried out to find new and innovative techniques for the treatment of diseases ever since medical science became organized. \nStem cell therapy and research have provided a commendable breakthrough that has brought a bright ray of hope for people suffering from severe and hitherto untreatable diseases. \nWhat are stem cells? \nStem cells are the basic template cells that are found in the bone marrow. These cells later develop into different types of cells that are required in the body, such as brain cells, blood cells, bone cells and cells that compose of the heart tissue. In ideal conditions, stem cells divide to form various types of cells, often referred to as 'daughter cells'. \nWhere are stem cells found? \nStem cell research shows that there are different sources where stem cells initially develop, including: \nEmbryonic stem cells: \nAn embryo, which is 3 to 5 days old, begins to produce stem cells. The embryo, which is called a 'blastocyst' at this stage, contains an average of 150 cells. These pluripotent (divisible) stem cells have the ability to integrate into other type of cells. The versatile nature of embryonic stem cells allows them to be used for generating cells that help to repair or regenerate disease-affected tissues and organs. \nAdult stem cells: \nSmall number of these stem cells are found in most of the adult tissues, including the bone marrow and fat. Comparatively, adult stem cells have limited ability to regenerate different types of cells. Earlier, it was believed that adult stem cells, in the bone marrow, gave rise to only blood cells which have now been debunked by extensive research. \nStem cell therapy and research show that adult stem cells not only help to generate blood cells but are also useful for creating heart and bone cells. \nPerinatal stem cells: \nResearch into stem cells has shown that stem cells are also found in the amniotic fluid, which is a component of the umbilical cord. These cells have the ability to change into various other types of cells in the body. \nAdditional research is currently underway to determine the benefits of perinatal stem cells. \nBenefits of stem cells \nHuman development: \nStem cell therapy has a huge potential for treating numerous physiological and neurological disorders and diseases. Stem cells are being increasingly used for the treatment of congenital (birth) defects as these diseases are known to be caused due to an insufficient differentiation process of cells. \nAdditional research, on these stem cells, will help to find most effective uses (of stem cells) for the betterment of various diseases. \nTreatment therapies: \nAs stem cells have the ability to form other cells and tissues, it is likely to replace the 'organ donation' and organ transplant method. As an organ donation and implant process is long and complicated, stem cell therapy can efficiently help to replace the infected tissues and cells which can effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality rate associated with serious health conditions, including:\nType 1 diabetes\nParkinson's disease\nArthritis\nCardiovascular diseases\nSevere burn treatments\nReversing diseases: \nBy stimulating the differentiation process of stem cells, the possibility to generate cells, required to replace the diseased cells, is larger now. \nStem cell therapy and research are proving to be a new frontier in medicine and health all over the world. Reputed healthcare institutes like NeuroGen Brain and Spine Institute are providing the best stem cell therapy and treatment for various neurological diseases. \n"

S'Representative image\n JAIPUR: Important safety arrangements were not made by the IIS University administration during the mountaineering trials held for students to witness adventure sports on July 26. A 19-year-old girl had slipped to death from the university\'s roof which prompted cops to file an FIR against the university and the instructor. \n The lapses in safety were brought to light during police investigation, ACP Mansarovar, Deshraj Yadav said that cops will also issue a notice to the university and asked them to explain the safety arrangements being made. \n  "There should have been a safety net, ambulances and fire tenders present on the spot. Our investigation suggests no such arrangements were made on that day," Yadav said. \n The cops said they have found \'glaring negligence\' on account of the university and trainer Sunil Sanghi. On the morning of July 26, 19-year-old Aditi Sanghi lost her balance and fell from the sixth floor of the building. She was among several students gathered to witness trials for the mountaineering sport. The girl\'s father, Sunil Sanghi, himself was training the students when the mishap took place. \n The cops inspected the university and found that lives of many students were risked as they were allowed to stand on the roof of the university. "The height of the roof\'s wall was merely one feet. There were no railings either, imagine if there was a stampede, many more students would have died or sustained severe injuries," added police official. \n  The university also failed to inform government authorities about the training session being organized at the university campus. "As per the rules, ambulance and fire officials should have been deployed inside the university campus when the accident took place," Yadav added. The Jaipur police have already filed an FIR against administration and Sunil Sanghi under sections 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence). \nBookmark or read stories offline - Get latest news & live updates on the go on your smartphone with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device. \n'

S'The women in the movie may be strong and funny when they are in their secret lives but they make almost no push for empowerment in their oppressive lives.\nA still from Lipstick Under My Burkha. Credit: YouTube\nThat Lipstick Under My Burkha is a \xe2\x80\x9cbold\xe2\x80\x9d film in the Indian context is incontestable. It shows women looking for sex, enjoying it, looking for freedom from oppression, looking to be able to smoke and drink freely, looking for the chance to earn a living and be good at it. What\xe2\x80\x99s to carp about?\nBarring the film certification board\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre comments on the film, which have been repeated endlessly but need to be repeated again and again to see how monumentally foolish they are, the film has got accolades and awards. The film certification board, led by the fearlessly patriarchal Pahlaj Nihalani, denied the film release in January this year because: \xe2\x80\x9cThe story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contagious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe reviewers have called it a \xe2\x80\x9cmust watch\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cholding a mirror to society\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cfearlessly feminist\xe2\x80\x9d. Certainly, there is much to agree. The acting is good, sometimes excellent. The direction by Alankrita Shrivastava (who has also written the film) has both humour and pathos, without overwhelming the viewer.\nBut what does the story itself tell us that is fearlessly feminist or all about women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment?\nAs a feminist statement, it is something of a tragedy. All the four women pursue their dreams \xe2\x80\x93 whatever they may be \xe2\x80\x93 in secret. Whether it is Usha Buaji (Ratna Pathak-Shah, who is the shining light of the film with her deft touch), and her sexual awakening at 55 or young Rehana (Plabita Borthakur) trying to get out of the burkha insisted on by her parents and into the \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d scene at college or Shireen (Konkona Sen Sharma) who hides her job as a saleswoman from her overbearing, abusive, cheating husband, and finally Leela (Aahana Kumra), who has a boyfriend and dreams that do not include the planned arranged marriage, all these efforts to find themselves happen under the metaphorical burkha.\nA still from Lipstick Under My Burkha. Credit: YouTube\nThe women may be strong and funny when they are in their secret lives but they make almost no push for empowerment in their oppressive lives. Controlled and bound as they are by society and men, they appear to have no courage: they do not speak one word to challenge the shackles of patriarchy. In that, the film is in fact a beacon of hopelessness to women in India. If in the second decade of the 21st century, not one of these four women who live in the same building in Bhopal, cannot ever voice their anger or rage or frustration to their own families and friends openly, then one feels only despair for women in this country.\nWorse, the only way they can do what they want is by lying. Together with the tired old cliches of smoking, drinking and sex being markers of freedom, the film perpetuates the patriarchal stereotype that women are lying and conniving. One cannot and must not argue with the filmmaker\xe2\x80\x99s creative vision \xe2\x80\x93 that is her or his inalienable right. But it is possible to question the conclusions that this film is any sort of feminist masterpiece.\nThat patriarchy still exists in India is undeniable. That small town India can be a few decades behind big city India is also perhaps understandable. But the efforts made by the four women to escape their almost pre-ordained captivity and boredom, are only a series of familiar stereotypes. It is true that younger women are smoking more nowadays. But have we really come \xe2\x80\x9ca long way baby\xe2\x80\x9d as the ad for Virginia Slims once said? And where have we come? For intelligent women to go back to that is really sad and even worse, for them to be so unaware of the consequences. The burkha \xe2\x80\x93 and perhaps this is inadvertent \xe2\x80\x93 which is used as a symbol of oppression and secrecy also becomes a means to lie and steal. When Shireen, a successful saleswoman on the verge of a promotion, realises her abusive husband is cheating on her, she tracks down the \xe2\x80\x9cother woman\xe2\x80\x9d but says nothing to her husband. In her feminism, she gives in to patriarchy. The saving grace as far as feminism is Usha Buaji who owns the building and runs a successful business but even she is publicly humiliated by the young man she has a crush on.\nEven worse from a human point of view is that the other men and women around them are all bound by the shackles of prejudice. These four women cannot find even one ally. And yet, there are glimpses of freer people around them; just glimpses. Perhaps those are the feminist icons, although some also fall victim to the smoking-drinking-sex-pregnancy-abortion route to women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment.\nEven in oppressive societies, strong women and men do emerge. If they had not, women would not have reached where they have today. Lipstick under my Burkha, sadly for me as an ageing feminist, took me back a few decades because it did not even hint that such women exist. Instead, the women behaved the way men for millennia have been telling us women behave, without courage and honour. To me that is patronising patriarchy at its worst.\n'

S" Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar today said research submissions will no more be mandatory for promotion of college teachers teaching the under-graduate students. However, the Minister said ''for university teachers research work was mandatory earlier and will remain with no change.''Mr Javadekar furthter said that by amending the APIs (Academic Performance Indicators) for the college teachers, for the promotion purposes, student and community activities conducted by the teacher will be taken into consideration.The Minister pointed out the fact that for the sake of promotion it has become a common practice that fake researches were being presented and such things were unacceptable.While speaking at the beginning of a two-day national conference on higher education organised by Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College (University of Delhi) and Akhil Bharatiya Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh here, the Minister also said that the Government was trying to fulfill soon the 9,000 ad hoc posts in the Delhi University and the teachers should be regularised on the basis of merit.more UNI APS SNU 144\n"
