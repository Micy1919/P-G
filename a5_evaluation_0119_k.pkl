V Gil Yehuda .  I run the Open Source Program Office at Oath (Yahoo + Aol) . 356w ago. Given your expressed interest in Java based activities in the Big Data analysis space, the top of mind example is Apache Hadoop. Hadoop, and some of the related technologies in the Hadoop space, are largely developed by Yahoo! and contributed to Apache. These projects enjoy active participation from many companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Cloudera (which also provides commercial products in this area) and other too. Moreover, there is an ecosystem of related technologies that surround Hadoop that attract activity from many other technology companies too (such LinkedIn, Amazon, IBM, eBay, etc.). The projects list their credits (links below) which list the official committers. And of course there are many people behind the scenes in these companies and elsewhere too. In the case of Hadoop and the related HDFS, Hbase, Hive, Zookeeper, Oozie, Pig, HCatalog etc. (most of them managed within the Apache Software Foundation), Yahoo! is very involved in furthering the value of these technologies -- both for its use in our products (powering many Yahoo! products to meet the enormous scale) and also to contribute to the Open Source community for everyone else to find benefit from too. You might note that there are activities focused on the evolution of a technology platform itself, and there are activities that are focused on building things on top of these platforms. These differ in terms of the kinds of developers they attract as well as the degree of interest that some companies invest in. Some links for more info on the "who" and "where".

V George Drasky .  Sapper in British Army Reserves . 158w ago. In terms of when and where another large conflict involving western troops might break out is anybodies guess. Most nations are fairly war weary from 9 years of conflict in Iraq and 13 years Afghanistan and lets not forget there will still be troops in Afghanistan, there is little public support for another war. Saying that there was a lot of political support to go further in Syria, and a fair number of US troops are deploying to Iraq, including a BCT of the 82nd airborne if I'm not mistaken. There is also a large number of special forces fighting against ISIS which could pave the way for a larger troop deployment. Other places to look at could be Libya, following the ousting of Gaddafi Libya has degenerated into conflict between various militias and Islamic extremists, where the national government has been kicked out of Benghazi and now resides in the town of Tobruk not doing very much. To be honest most of sub-Saharan Africa is in turmoil with famines, drought, dictators and Islamic extremism. Nigeria could be the scene of a western intervention if the country degenerates into another civil war. If Al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsular make a comeback in Yemen western troops could be called in, there are already special forces there. . Looking away from fighting Al-Qaeda or ISIS, there has been increasing tensions in the Baltics and eastern Europe following Russian action in Ukraine. If North Korea kicked off that would be a nasty conflict in of itself, but would have the potential to get worse by dragging in China and the US. Of course there is always a possibility that something could kick off in the middle east e.g. between Israel and Iran, or in Asia between Pakistan and India whilst both conflicts would be horrendously damaging there would be a relatively small likelihood of western boots on the deck. . To be honest there are thousands of potential scenarios that could blow up damn near anywhere in the world, with the only real guarantee being that it will probably be unexpected. Thats why we are ever vigilant and the military train constantly for unanticipated scenarios.

V Peter Darbyshire .  Writer, author of The Warhol Gang and Please. You may show up in my next book! . 366w ago. Depends on what you mean by greatest. . In terms of people really breaking new ground:. Bertolt Brecht. Samuel Beckett. Harold Pinter. Steven Berkoff. Caryl Churchill. Tom Stoppard. Stephen Sondheim. But that's just a matter of taste.  Lauren Gunderson .  playwright, dramatist, feminist, science advocate, banjo player, lover of whiskey and coffee and fancy tea . 365w ago. The "best" in any artistic genre is impossible to gauge. There are so many aesthetics, styles, artistic goals, director-playwrights collaborations and other designations that come in to play in the making of great new theatre. . The "bests" would definitely include (mainly from a Western perspective): Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, August Wilson, Lorraine Hansberry, Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, Pinter, Michael Frayn, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Ionesco, Fugard, Woel Soyinka, Tony Kushner, Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, Paula Vogel, Anna Devere Smith, David Henry Hwang, Sarah Kane... So many greats. Who needs a greatest ;).  Howard Sherman .  Veteran Theatre Professional . 365w ago.  Limiting the scope of the answer solely to the U.S., the \u201cbig four\u201d are generally considered to be Eugene O\u2019Neill, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. But such questions are really only conversation starters, since any answer is subjective, and by adding qualifications, or narrowing the scope, you can draw out more great artists, and have yourself a great debate with other theatre buffs. .  Robert Larson Jr .  sales at Optymyze . 192w ago. Sam Shepard. He has won a Pulitzer prize, I think roughly 7 obie awards has a career of active writing that has spanned 5 decades and has well over 50 pieces of work. .  Jonathan Simpson-Bint .  Father. Husband. Physicist. CRO at twitch.tv. Reads a lot. Owns 20,000 albums. CTID. . 33w ago. Special mention for Joe Orton. His impact on the theatre scene in England in the mid-late sixties is hard to imagine now... The country was finally shrugging off the binds of WWII, Beatlemania was rampant and he came along with a voice and attitude that electrified audiences and critics alike. . Watch Stephen Frears's masterful "Prick Up Your Ears" for all the proof you need.  Martine Silber . 361w ago.  Some of the most famous in The XIX century are forgotten to-day...so it's nice to have a look at the "new" ones such as Lars Noren (could be the best of XXI th),Martin Crimp, Phlippe Mynhiana, and of course Sarah Kane, .

VChildren in Baltimore\u2019s public schools are freezing in their own classrooms \u2014 and both parents and teachers want answers. Thousands of children were forced to huddle in their coats to keep warm. \u201cThe water is cold!\u201d one mother told WJZ. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable. There\u2019s icicles in the classroom. The cold water jug is frozen solid. It\u2019s inhumane for these children.\u201d. Everyone was clueless as to why the schools lacked heat. \u201cIt\u2019s just too cold to even try to learn anything,\u201d said The Baltimore Teachers Union President, Marietta English. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to be in a coat and all these things to teach, and you can\u2019t expect these children to pay attention when the temperatures are this low.\u201d. Many of the schools need windows repaired and lack the infrastructure for heat. A number of schools have even had to close because they were just too cold. When photos of the children huddled together for warmth circulated online, parents and community members started a GoFundMe to try to fix the problem. Together, they have raised more than $75,000. But the issue remains that parents and community members are already paying for school maintenance by paying their taxes. After pressure from parents, teachers, and the community, Mayor Catherine Pugh finally addressed the situation, sending emergency maintenance to the schools. Moreover, Mayor Pugh added an additional $2 million in funding to the annual budget to repair the infrastructure. \u201cIt is also important to note that, for the current school year, we have allocated $17 million in funding for maintenance issues and have increased that amount to $19 million for next year,\u201d Pugh said in a statement.

VTony Okoroji. The Chairman, Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON), Chief Tony Okoroji, yesterday began an indefinite one-man demonstration in front of the Federal High Court, Lagos. Okoroji said his action has become necessary to draw the attention of the world to a new and dangerous attempt to destroy the Nigerian judicial system by the blackmail of a Nigerian judge to force him not to deliver a judgment written by him. The former president of PMAN, who is well respected for his depth of knowledge in intellectual property issues across the continent, arrived the court as early as 8: 00am for the protest, which he said would continue till necessary action is taken on the matter. Okoroji is asking all lawyers and judges in the Nigerian legal system to insist that the case file in Suit No FHC/L/CS/1259/2017, which he alleged was taken away in bizarre circumstances from Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Federal High Court, Lagos, just as he was about to deliver judgment in the suit, be returned to the judge so that he can deliver his judgment and any of the parties dissatisfied with the judgment can proceed to the Court of Appeal. According to Chief Okoroji, \u201cthe key question Justice Buba was scheduled to answer in his judgment is this: Under Nigerian law, is the syndicate known as Musical Copyright Society Nigeria (MCSN) truly an approved collecting society and authorised to collect money on behalf of innocent Nigerian musicians? Some people desperately do not want that question answered hence the muscling of Justice Ibrahim Buba and the failed machinations to remove Okoroji himself as Chairman of COSON.\u201d. SON General Assembly met in Lagos and condemned in very strong terms what it termed the brazen actions of the Attorney-General of the Federation & Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami in ordering the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), despite the Commission\u2019s strong protestations, to blatantly go against Nigerian law and approve the MCSN syndicate to collect copyright royalties on behalf of innocent Nigerian musicians.

VOne person died after dozens of people jumped more than 10 feet into frigid winter waters after the shuttle ferrying them to a casino ship off the Florida Gulf Coast caught fire, authorities said Monday. All 50 passengers aboard made it to shore Sunday, the Coast Guard told NBC News on Sunday night. One woman died after she arrived at a hospital emergency room, said Kurt Conover, a spokesman for Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point. The 42-year-old woman died at 10:42 p.m. ET, said Kevin Doll, a spokesman for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. The woman went to the ER hours after the fire occurred, Conover said. Her name wasn't been released, and a cause of death hadn't been determined. Eight other passengers were treated at and released from Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, Conover said. In total, about 15 people were treated at hospitals for minor injuries and as a precaution for hypothermia, police said. The shuttle caught fire at about 3:30 p.m. ET Sunday as it was making its way to the Tropical Breeze Casino Cruise, according to Beth Fifer, the casino's assistant chief executive. Port Richey Police Chief Gerard DeCanio said the captain saw smoke from the engine and turned the boat around. Then he started having engine trouble, said DeCanio, who said the captain had been reporting engine trouble before Sunday. DeCanio said there was no suspicion of foul play. A boat burns Sunday after it caught fire while ferrying patrons to a casino ship off the Florida Gulf Coast. Fifer said it was the first such incident since the shuttle began operating in 1995. Shuttles are needed to ferry customers to the casino, which operates in the Gulf of Mexico because it's not allowed on land in Florida. Qaadia Culbreath was on board preparing to celebrate his upcoming 30th birthday when the fire broke out. Culbreath, who said he doesn't know how to swim, told NBC News affiliate WFLA that he didn't see any life jackets when the fire began to spread and was told to jump. "The guy that was in the water said, 'Man, jump, jump, jump.' I was like, 'Man, I can't swim.' So I was trying to climb off, and I was dangling off the metal hanger in the front of the boat because I didn't want to let go," Culbreath said. As the boat headed to shore, Culbreath was able to navigate the shallow water to safety.

VKAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni accused the United Nations on Wednesday of \u201cpreserving terrorism\u201d in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo where U.N. peacekeepers have been unable to curb deadly attacks by Islamist rebels. . Museveni leveled the criticism in a statement after meeting U.N. officials investigating an ambush of peacekeepers in eastern Congo last month that left 15 dead and 53 wounded. . The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group that has been operating in the chaotic eastern Congo jungles for years, was widely blamed for the attack. . \u201cThe United Nations is responsible for preserving terrorism in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d Museveni told U.N. investigators, according to the statement from his office. . It did not elaborate and Museveni\u2019s spokeswoman did not respond to calls seeking an explanation. There was no immediate comment from the United Nations. . The attack was described by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres as the worst on the world body in recent history. . Set up in 2010, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo called MONUSCO is the global body\u2019s largest but has struggled to neutralize a patchwork of rebel and militia factions in eastern Congo and has previously drawn criticism from Museveni. . A few days after the ADF attack, Uganda carried out air and artillery strikes on the group\u2019s camps. Kampala said it had intelligence the rebels were planning hostile acts against it. . The East African country, which has a history of meddling in lawless eastern Congo, is eager to prevent the ADF from re-entering Uganda\u2019s oil-rich western region as the resulting insecurity could force out investors. . Uganda is aiming to start pumping crude in its west in 2020. . Reporting by Elias Biryabarema; editing by Mark Heinrich. Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

V User covers the larger scale version well in his answer. For residential projects, like you commonly see in bathrooms, a thin electrical mesh is embedded in the layer of mortar under a tile floor. This mesh is then heated, electrical, similar to an electric blanket, and the heat radiates upward. .  Kyle Stubbs .  Communications Professional at Warmquest . 142w ago. Hydronics have been covered pretty thoroughly. . Electric systems are gaining in popularity. They work well in remodels and existing structures, provide a more even heat than glycol, and have a variety of control set ups. . A Mesh or Cable is laid out on the subfloor. Cables can be either free-flowing or entwined in mats for roll out installation. . While cables must be encased in mortar or a similar heatsink, some mesh systems are laid out directly beneath the floor covering.  Michael Vaughan . 178w ago. There are two types of heated floor solutions: . Firstly there is one that runs underneath your flooring that is water based. Warm water runs through pipes under the designated areas and heats up the flooring above it. Secondly there is an electric underfloor heating option. Electric wires sit directly underneath the floor and heat up which then provides a nice warm floor. . In my experience both heated floor solutions work really well.  Ryan Perry . 72w ago. As mentioned earlier heated water circulates through the pipes and warms the flooring\u2026. Liquid screed is also known as flowing screed. In the past electric heating elements were buried within floor screed. These were heated overnight using \u2018cheap rate\u2019 electricity\u2019. An underfloor heating system in concrete relies on the thermal conductivity of the screed to transfer the heat to the rooms. It may be a slow response system, so the underfloor heating should be on 24/7 during the heating season with setback options available.  Michelle Adams .  works at Freelancing . 163w ago.  Heated floors can be electric and hydronic. A hydronic uses a variety of sources to heat the water. There are two types of installation -- wet or dry. Wet installs layer either a slab of concrete beneath the subfloor or a thin sheet of concrete between the subfloor and the surface. Dry installs place the tubes directly beneath the subfloor during construction, without the concrete on top. In concrete screeded floors, the screed acts to diffuse the heat across the surface, providing an even temperature at floor level. Electric heated floor uses heat-conducting plastic mats containing coils warmed by electricity. .

VWindhoek \u2014 Ethiopian Airlines, the largest aviation group in Africa and SKYTRAX certified Four Star Global Airline, has confirmed that it has finalised a shareholders agreement with the Government of Zambia for the re-launch of Zambia Airways. The Government of Zambia will be the majority shareholder with 55 percent, and Ethiopian Airlines will have 45 percent stake in the airline. Tewolde Gebremariam, Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines (Ethiopian) remarked: "In line with our Vision 2025 multiple hubs strategy in Africa, we are very happy that the discussions with the Zambian government have been crowned with success. "The launching of Zambia Airways will enable the travelling public in Zambia and the Southern African region to enjoy greater connectivity options, thereby facilitating the flow of investment, trade and tourism, and contributing to the socioeconomic growth of the country and the region. "As an indigenous and truly Pan-African airline, we firmly believe that it is only through partnerships among African carriers that the aviation industry of the continent will be able to get its fair share of the African market, currently heavily skewed in favour of non-African airlines, and play its rightful role in availing efficient air connectivity within Africa as well as with the rest of the world". The airline is meant to initially serve national and regional destinations before embarking on international flights. With the establishment of multiple hubs in Africa being an overarching strategy of Ethiopian under its Vision 2025, it currently operates hubs in Lomé (Togo) with ASKY Airlines, and in Lilongwe (Malawi). Ethiopian Airlines is still the fastest growing airline in Africa and in its 70 plus years of operation it has become one of the continent's leading carriers, unrivalled in efficiency and operational success. Ethiopian is currently implementing a 15-year strategic plan called Vision 2025 through which it aims to become the leading aviation group in Africa.

VA while back, we made a post about people who were perusing art galleries and museums and spontaneously stumbled upon their doppelganger, in fine art form. Perhaps inspired by this, Google have decided to add a feature to their Arts & Culture app that uses facial recognition technology to match your selfie with a famous portrait. The portraits are pulled from a database of celebrated works collected from over 1000 museums worldwide, so the chances of a half-decent match should be fairly high, shouldn\u2019t they?. Well now the results are in, and it\u2019s fair to say that they are mixed, at best. This seems to part of the appeal however, as people have begun posting their hilarious (mis)matches online and they are proving to be wildly popular. You can see why!. Sadly, the feature isn\u2019t yet available outside of the U.S. so if you\u2019re not stateside and would like to give it a try, you\u2019ll have to be a little patient.

VA former Interim National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Chief Bisi Akande, says the Presidential System of Government that Nigeria is practising can no longer sustain its growth and success. Akande made the remark while addressing a news conference in his country home, Ila, Osun state as part of activities to mark his 79th birthday. He said that multi-party parliamentary democracy was the best form of government for Nigeria if it wanted to catch up with the rest of the civilised world. Akande, a former governor, said that the American democratic system was too complicated and costly for a country of poor people with large illiteracy rate like Nigeria. According to him, the Nigerian nation is currently running a difficult government under an unworkable setup. \u201cPresident Buhari is my friend and I want him to succeed but he is running a difficult system of government. \u201cNigeria\u2019s democracy is a military democracy of sharing and if we continue like this, there is no how we can succeed. \u201cUp to this present age, evidence-based analyses has proven parliamentary democracy to be the most accountable transparent form of government in the whole world,\u2019\u2019 he said. He said that parliamentary democracy had helped countries like the United Kingdom become rich, stable and respectable globally and also made the very young Israel very strong economically and militarily. \u201cIt is also transforming India from acute poverty and hunger into self-sufficiency and reliability virtually in all fields. \u201cApart from being transparent and accountable, parliamentary democracy is absolutely inclusive. \u201cIt appears to be the best form of governmental structure for Nigeria now,\u2019\u2019 he said. Akande, a former governor of Osun state maintained that anything less accountable and transparent would not help the development of the country. (NAN).

V Cathy Goodwin .  Adopted and volunteered . 8w ago.  Md Rasel .  former Owner at Small Businesses . 27w ago. In USA, there is Best Pets Adoption website. which was already been successfully used by my sister to find humans to several cats. My sister takes a homeless cat in for 2\u20133 days, treats them for fleas and worms, then finds him/her humans via this site. The average time a person calls in for adoption after the post on the site is 2 days.I would encourage other people to post answers with links for their area, if they happen to have similar projects (or facebook groups, whatever) around.  Jones Schmit . 70w ago. Hi you have asked a very nice question. Now-a-days dogs are very much tortured by human but I was very much happy after getting information about The Vanderpump Dog Foundation which works for the protection of dog. The main aim of this organization is to provide a healthy and good world to dogs. I think this is the best option for your question.

V Maria Day .  PhD student in Computer Science . 91w ago. It depends how the linked list is stored in the memory and whether you care about I/O efficiency or not. The straightforward traversal of the linked list has complexity of O(N) I/O-s, the best you can do is [math]O(N/B log_{M/B}N/B)[/math] where M is the size of internal memory and B is the size of lines that you can transfer each time from external memory. For large values of B it is much better than O(N). Look for I/O efficient list ranking algorithm.  Petter Häggholm .  minor encyclopedia poorly disguised as a human computer programmer. . 91w ago. Can a linked list traversal run-time do better than O(n) - linear run-time?. Unless you are using some form of parallelism, you can't traverse any data structure in less than O(n) time. After all, you need to process each element; that's n right there. .  Vathany S . 93w ago. How to write a function for sorted intersection for Linklist in Cprogramming. void intersection(Linklist *a Linklist *b,Linklist *result).  Roman Tsegelskyi .  MS student, Purdue university . 131w ago.  No o(n) is the best complexity you can get, since during traversal you need to "touch" n elements. .  Borislav Milanovic .  PhD from Goethe University Frankfurt (2015) . 91w ago. I believe you could parallelise the traversal and obtain something like [math]\u005cTheta(log n)[/math]. Take a look at Pointer jumping. .

V Dan Lenski .  2:36 marathon PR; ran about 3700 miles in 2014 . 151w ago. I agree with Guy McArthur's answer. You need to replace electrolytes lost from sweating. I don't know of whether there are any large-scale studies on the efficacy of salt tablets compared to other ways of replenishing salt, like sports drinks and gel packets. As with all questions related to nutrition for endurance sports, there is probably a wide range of personal preferences. A general rule of thumb is not to try eating/drinking/chewing anything during a race which you haven't already tested out on a few long training runs :-).  Guy McArthur .  has a serious running habit . 153w ago.  For electrolyte replacement (to replace that lost in sweat and to speed recovery). However, you definitely do not want your salt-to-water ratio to become too high (hypernatremia) or too low (hyponatremia). Generally speaking, you'll be fine if you're taking in sports drink (or some food, e.g. gels and water) every few miles (i.e. at aid stations). .  Humberto Ramos Fernandez .  barefoot marathoner and ironman . 150w ago. I am not sure about scientific benefits, but for me they do work. I use them for every run above 25km and every bike ride above 100km. . Maybe its a mental thing, but as long as it works I am all up for it.

Pope Francis has apologised for cases of sexual abuse by clergy in the Catholic Church, saying he felt \u201cpain and shame at the irreparable damage caused to children by some ministers of the church\u2019\u2019. \u201cI am one with my brother bishops, for it is right to ask for forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims. \u201cAlthough, we have committed ourselves to ensuring that such things do not happen again,\u2019\u2019 the pope said. He was speaking before Chilean dignitaries in Santiago de Chile. Earlier this week, the Vatican took over a Peru-based Catholic sect whose founder has been accused of sexual and psychological abuse. Meanwhile, in Chile during the pope\u2019s visit on Monday, activists promised to protest every day of the visit over his 2015 appointment of a bishop accused of covering up for one of the country\u2019s most notorious paedophiles. On Jan. 10, the Vatican said it had appointed a commissioner to oversee the lay Catholic movement Sodalitium of Christian Life. However, Peruvian prosecutors had announced they were seeking the arrest on charges of sexual, physical and psychological abuse, of the group\u2019s founder, Luis Fernando Figari, and five other members. Meanwhile, the Pope had shown particular attention to the gravity of the information. The pontiff would return to the Vatican on Sunday. Get more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook.

V Ian Driver .  lived in New York City . 188w ago.  There are no commercial vehicles allowed on the Henry Hudson. In addition there are a couple of low bridges, so very bad things happen when tall vehicles drive there. I think the fdr is the same. .  Thomas Mei .  lives in New York City . 188w ago. To follow up on Ian's answer : The FDR is a quick flowing highway with some pretty tight turns. To have buses on that road would increase the likelihood of a traffic accident. There are also exits in which you would have to stop very suddenly, I'm thinking the 63rd street exit going southbound in particular. Buses and trucks would not handle the FDR well, if at all. .  I was told that my small Uhaul truck with a hitch would get me ticketed on the FDR by a well meaning Taxi Cab driver when I was refueling at a gas station once. (Was helping someone move).  Harry Drew .  Coach Bus driver . 140w ago.  What are you talking about? Coach buses are always on the Henry Hudson Parkway, I should know, I'm one of them. What low overpass? There aren't any. .

VThe United States will withhold over half of the $125m (\u20ac101m) it gives to a UN agency in aid for Palestinians, a US official said on Tuesday. It will hand over $60 million (\u20ac49m) to the UN Relief and Works Agency, but $65 million (\u20ac53m) will be kept back "for future consideration". . The official, who spoke under the condition of anonymity did not relate the decision to a January 2 threat made by President Donald Trump on Twitter in which he said that Washington gives the Palestinians "HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect". "It is time other countries, some of them quite wealthy, step in and do their part to advance regional security and stability," the official said. . The US funds almost 30 per cent of the UN Relief and Works Agency's overall work in 2016. . That's double the amount given by the second largest donor\u2014the EU. In a subsequent tweet, Trump said he didn't see why the US should "make any of these massive future payments" to the Palestinians, as they were "no longer willing to talk peace". On Sunday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not accept a US peace plan after Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital last year.

V Leopold Martin .  B.Sc. Computational Linguistics & Literature, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2019) . 1w ago. I don\u2019t know why \u201cpeople\u201d read, but I read \u2026. To learn things I do not know. To see things I have not seen, hear things I have not heard before. To experience things, I have not expereinced, things I will never expereince, things I don\u2019t really want to expereince myself. To escape reality. To see the world through the eyes of another person. To travel through time and taste the sweetness and bitterness of other times. There are so many reasons to read a book, but the desire to learn things about people, things, worlds, and ultimately myself is the best motivation I can find.  Radhika Padmasekar .  M.C.A Master of Computer Applications, University of Madras (2018) . 1w ago. People read books because of there interest in reading,book are being good companions.it\u2019s sort of entertainment ,only readers can get that feel.More than gaining knowledge,intellectual,etc,it\u2019s greater timepass. Fictitious & comic books never fails to entertain.  Devy Mahyuning . 1w ago. Because Books is the only best addiction. You\u2019ll continue to be curious every page, untill you have uncosciously became a part of the books.  Rebel Phoenix . 2w ago. The real question is why not? Technology is awesome and honestly I think I\u2019m a bit addicted to my phone. And books are my relief from that, they give less of a strain on your eyes and could potentially help with posture depending on how you hold the book. Another reason is because books are like movie scripts as you act it out in your imagination whether it\u2019s a factual or fiction book.  Jayrajsingh Saddiwal . 2w ago. To imagine what the can't do or travel etc . Reading would reduce your expense on traveling on purchasing a high rated item would improve your thinking.

VDeputy Chief of Staff Abu Jinapor says it is evidence of the government\u2019s high transparency ratings that a bipartisan probe has been instituted into allegations, the presidency was used for profiteering. He said on Joy FM\u2019s Super Morning Show Wednesday, the probe which is telecast live shows the government has nothing to hide from the Ghanaian public. The politician pointed out the probe would never have happened under the previous government of President John Mahama. \u201cIn the four years of President Mahama\u2019s administration, not a single bi-partisan probe took place,\u201d despite several scandals, he said. But in about a year into the Akufo-Addo government, two parliamentary probes have occurred. The first probe was into bribery allegations levelled by some Minority National Democratic Congress MPs who claimed a ministerial nominee, Boakye Agarko, had paid monies to have his nomination approved after a turbulent vetting process. In the latest probe, a private event organiser, Millennium Excellence Foundation asked potential sponsors to pay $100,000 to gain proximity to the special guest at an expatriate awards dinner, President Akufo-Addo. The Foundation partnered the Ministry of Trade and Industry which collected the monies from sponsors. The ministry and the Foundation have denied allegations seats were sold to business leaders to have access to the President. The President expressed satisfaction no wrong was done but days later an NDC Minority motion tabled in Parliament called for a bipartisan probe into the issues. But the Deputy Chief of Staff observed that \u201cwhen people are unsettled even when you believe those allegations are spurious you allow investigations\u201d, he said. He said in the Ford gift saga, one of the biggest scandals under Mahama, a similar request for a probe by the then NPP Minority was \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the NDC Majority then who now constitute the Minority and spearheaded the process for the current probe. In the Ford gift saga, a luxury Ford Expedition was given to the president by a Burkinabe contractor. The Minority then filed a motion calling for a bi-partisan probe but the motion was arrested even before it was debated. It was anticipated that NPP Minority would follow that example in the instant case but House Speaker Prof. Mike Aaron Oquaye, after a rather rancorous debate on the motion filed by Minority Chief Whip, Alhaji Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak, announced the establishment of a five-member committee to look into the allegations. Abu Jinapor pointed out that despite the transparency of the Akufo-Addo government, there is a desperate attempt to stigmatise the government of corruption even without a basis. He stressed the president\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption remains unflinching.

VA United flight bound for Paris made an unscheduled stop in Dulles, Va., due to a passenger requiring medical assistance. (iStock). A United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Paris diverted to Washington-Dulles International Airport on Sunday due to a passenger requiring medical assistance. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Rick Breitenfeldt confirmed early on Monday that United 990 was diverting to Dulles, Va., following a medical issue on-board. Jonathan Guerin, a spokesman for United Airlines, says the flight landed at 1 a.m. EST. . "On Sunday, United Airlines Flight 990 from San Francisco to Paris diverted to Washington-Dulles for a passenger requiring medical assistance. The flight landed safely and continued to Paris a couple of hours later," said United in an official statement. . DIVERSION. United #UA990. San Francisco to Paris. Diverting to Washington.

Details surrounding the exact nature of the medical issue weren't immediatable available. The FAA is said to be investigating. United also diverted a second plane over the weekend, due to a "mechanical issue with the lavatories," a spokesman for United confirmed to Fox News. Passengers on the flight, which left from Denver for Hawaii, but ended up turning back for San Francisco more than halfway into its journey, say the pilot informed passengers that the plane's bathrooms were not properly serviced before departing from Denver.

V Dale Martin .  lived in Vietnam War . 166w ago.  I was 19, an Officer and Aviator, I had been in Country 17 days, when the Battle of Soui Tre took place. Two of my newest buds, both USAF FAC's were shot down and killed early in the morning of 21 Mar 1967. I wound up flying LTC Julian, the CO of the 2/22 Inf. Mechanized, and a Major who was Elvis Presley's Platoon Leader in Germany, in a search for a quick route from Soui Da to Soui Tre, about 5-6 miles thru triple canopy and thick undergrowth jungle. We were shot at quite a bit, but the NVA missed us completely, when I found out what they were looking for, a place to cross the Prek Loc River, I remembered seeing a gravel ford the day before, so I flew there and dropped smoke. The Mech Unit and the Armored Unit (34 Armored Regt--Elvis' old unit when they were in Germany!) were able to cross the otherwise impassible river and relieve the unit under siege in LZ Gold, which was what we called Soui Tre. Only later did I realize just how dangerous this mission was, and I had to resort to a shot or two of Wild Turkey just to calm down that night. A US Unit was saved from almost certain destruction by this flight. I was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross at the age of 19, which at the time did not mean all that much to me, but it does now, there have only been a few teenaged receipients of this award, G. H. W. Bush among them....and this writer....Make of this what you will, as at the time, it was the expected duty of Aviators to make every effort to accomplish the mission, at whatever cost. .

V Gio Gargiulo .  worked at YouTube . 131w ago.  Facebook and YouTube are not even competing, imho. You don't turn to Facebook when you're looking for a movie trailer, or a tech review, or an official music video, just like you don't open YouTube to watch videos posted by your friends about their last vacation. They have very different "markets", in this sense. Of course, you could easily find the same video on both websites, but the conditions in which you'd watch it on one rather than the other are usually very different. .  Matthew Kay . 131w ago.  One of the things that makes YouTube a great platform for conent creators is that YouTube's shares ad revenue them. Now that Facebook is planning on doing something similar with video, YouTube could sweeten its pot by increasing the percentage of ad revenue that it shares with content creators. Perhaps there are more variables that one could consider however I think that stands out as the most impactful one. .  Robbie Wolle .  Probably 2k hours in YouTube . 131w ago.  I've already answered a question like this less than 24 hours ago. Facebook has very little traction in video, in face the majortiy come from other sources and I would believe 75% of those sources are from YouTube. .

VTunis - The first ever film festival celebrating the LGBT community is underway in Tunisia, a Muslim country where homosexuals can face up to three years in prison. Twelve short and medium-length films produced in Tunisia and across the Middle East and North Africa are being shown at the "Mawjoudin Queer Film Festival" that opened on Monday. The four-day event is organised by Mawjoudin, Arabic for "We Exist", a Tunisian non-governmental association which defends the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It is the first event of its kind in Tunisia and the organisers say the "festival conceives of itself as audacious". The films "speak of sexuality, identity and gender affiliation," said Senda Ben Jebara, a member of Mawjoudin, a group founded in 2014. "Through this festival we would like to give a space to queer people in general in order to escape a bit from social pressure, and also to identify with something, find a means to express ourselves," she said. "We are trying to fight not only in the courts but through art.". Ben Jebara said the messages which the festival would like to get across are that "we are different but we exist and differences are welcome". Mourad, a 21-year-old festival-goer, said the film fest "helps to strengthen the LGBT community and brings together people who are considered different". Gay rights activists have emerged from the shadows in Tunisia since the revolution in 2011, but their position remains precarious in the North African country's conservative Muslim society. Article 230 of the penal code includes a punishment of up to three years in prison for homosexuality and young men are regularly detained and prosecuted. An online radio station catering for the LGBT community, believed to be the first of its kind in the Arab world, started broadcasting in Tunisia on December 18. But Shams Rad, which was set up by LGBT rights group Shams and promotes "dignity, equality", is now facing legal procedures aimed at shutting it down.

VModest Mouse, Margo Price, Brent Cobb and the War on Drugs will also perform at the Louisville, Kentucky, festival. Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell are among the artists performing at Forecastle Festival in Louisville, Kentucky. The annual Forecastle Festival, launched in 2002, has announced its 2018 lineup, with Chris Stapleton, Arcade Fire and Modest Mouse headlining the three-day event in Louisville, Kentucky. Held on the banks of the Ohio River, Forecastle is set for July 13th through 15th. As in years past, the lineup is particularly diverse, with artists from T-Pain and Vic Mensa to Lucero and White Reaper on the bill. But this year's roster also boasts a heavy dose of country and Americana. Along with co-headliner Stapleton, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, Margo Price, Brent Cobb, Tyminski, Houndmouth, the Punch Brothers, Jenny Lewis and female folk trio I'm With Her are all scheduled to perform. . Billed as a weekend of music, art and activism, Forecastle adopts a nautical theme, taking advantage of its location on Louisville's 85-acre Waterfront Park. Past headliners have included LCD Soundsystem, Alabama Shakes and Modest Mouse, who last performed in 2015, a year that also saw Stapleton make his first Forecastle appearance. . Other artists set for 2018 include the War on Drugs, Kurt Vile and the Violators, Father John Misty, Jimmy Eat World, Hiss Golden Messenger and Ron Gallo. Tickets for Forecastle go on sale January 19th at 10:00 a.m./Eastern. See the full lineup below.

VNike's '1 Reimagined' collection turns the Air Force 1 into a minimalist platform slide, and the Air Jordan 1 into a surrealist work of wearable art. Get a first look at the trippy women's kicks, modeled by Kelsey Lu and Abra! . The women behind Nike\u2019s latest collection were given five weeks and the briefest of briefs: \u201cMake some cool shit.\u201d Today the brand unveiled the final result of the \u201c1 Reimagined\u201d project: 10 fresh AF takes on Nike\u2019s iconic Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1. The collection is the latest evidence of Nike\u2019s commitment to female sneakerheads both on the street and behind-the-scenes. In October, the brand made 25-year-old Aleali May the second woman to collaborate with Jordan Brand, and the first ever to design a pair for dudes (after getting approval from His Airness himself). This is hardly a newfound wokeness either: Nike\u2019s famous Swoosh symbol was designed by a woman four decades ago. . This time, Nike tapped 14 longtime design staffers: 10 designers, two material designers, and two color designers. Their reimagined kicks pay tribute to Nike\u2019s female fans and DIY-friendly heritage. Marie Crow, Materials Design Director at Nike, told i-D that \u201cthe Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1 are the most fantastic shoes to work on because they are blank canvases.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one to think so: NIKEiD has been offering customization services since 2012, while the world/internet is full of Nike diehards putting their own spin on iconic styles. Artist Alexandra Hackett, a.k.a. Mini Swoosh, is a longtime fan of the Air Force 1. . So how did the all-star female team interpret \u201ccool shit\u201d? The directive might be simple, but the new designs are ingenious and borderline surreal. An Air Force 1 has had the Swoosh symbol unpicked and reattached, creating a \u201cfloating\u201d effect with the original outline still visible. Other styles feature bold platform soles or asymmetrical tongues. One has been cheekily converted into a minimalist slip-on with subtle perforation. Each sneaker was given a personality: the slide is a v. chill "sage," while the \u201cexplorer\u201d combines reflective utility layering and on-trend elastic laces. The collection drops on February 7 at select New York City retail locations, making fashion week a success before it's even started.

Hey Brian . Stop picking at it, you will give it an infection. Bark is the tree\u2019s skin, if you keep cutting into it or keep picking off the buds then all sorts of nasties can get in and your tree will die. Chemicals to kill buds dont exist because they will also get under the bark and kill the whole tree. When the tree is dormant in the winter cut any branches from last year you don\u2019t want back as close as you can, in time your tree will take shape. Trees up to 3 or 4 years old are  meant to look a bit ugly dont fret about it ma duck. .

V Pavan Priyatham .  I love studying people. . 27w ago. When you start working towards your goals no matter how bad the odds are stacked up against you. When you acknowledge that people can have their own opinion. May be it be political, religious, or moral. When you stop following your Facebook friends and start following good writers on Quora. When you can no longer tolerate the stupidity of the so called social media apps like Instagram and snapchat. When you don't use a dog filter for your display picture. When you no longer have the habit of staring at foreign tourists in the country and learn to respect their privacy. When you stop spitting and littering on roads and historical monuments. When you no longer stop your vehicle on the zebra crossing at the signals, rather you halt a good 5 feet away from it. When you stop crossing the road showing your palm at the speeding cars and motorists as if you're a traffic police. When you stop asking or following dumbass questions about too old to learn something or about how to get girls\u2019 attention on Quora. When you finally understand that IITs and IIMs aren't the only places you need to go for a successful career and that not everyone is constrained to do the same engineering. And finally when you understand that Quora too can be a productivity killer after a certain limit.  Yashvardhan Singh .  I love the way we think! :D . 91w ago. Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. But maturity is when we start understanding small things. :).  Sajjad Hussain .  10+ years of experience as Mentor, Trainer, & Counselor . 90w ago. You become mature, when you start;. Speaking less and listening more; . Stop being biased;. Respect humanity/culture/religions;. Accept diversity; and. Last but not the least, 'Practice Ethics' (as much as possible) .  Rohit Srivastav . 223w ago.  When He/She can answer this question themself. .  Vikas Kumar Pandey .  Professional Sigmund Freud . 223w ago.  Maturity is when you start feeling more "Peer-pressure" than the "Parent's -pressure". .

VAirbnb has today announced a new feature that will help users manage their payments on the platform. The feature, aptly albeit unimaginatively named Pay Less Up Front, lets users pay for a part of their trip upon booking and the rest near the time of check-in. Before now, Airbnb users had to pay 100 percent of their booking up front. For weekend trips, that wasn\u2019t such a big deal. But long stays can end up being relatively expensive and thus inconvenient to pay for up-front. This comes on the heels of another payments feature that lets group travelers split payments at the time of booking. Airbnb said that, during testing of the Pay Less Up Front feature, 40 percent of guests chose to go with that option and chose higher-value bookings. The company also said that users who chose to use the feature booked with 2x the lead time compared to ordinary bookings. Airbnb determines the amount that can be paid up front and the amount that is due a few days before check-in, which the company says is usually 50 percent. One stipulation of the feature is that bookings must be made 14 days ahead of check-in and must be at least $250 total. The new feature is available now across all platforms.

V Matthew Bates .  Teacher (2009-present) . 25w ago. What does Matthew Bates think about the Goldman Norman show?. I believe you\u2019re talking about the Norman Goldman progressive talk radio show. I enjoy it. It happens to be on while I\u2019m making dinner for the family every night. I listen to the first 30\u201340 minutes of it. Sometimes I catch the end of it a couple of hours later when I clean the kitchen, after the kids are tucked in for the night. I believe that Goldman\u2019s progressive philosophy comes from a good place in his heart. I just think he, like most progressives, is completely out of touch with the political realities of the US. For example, he\u2019s an advocate for a national single-payer healthcare system. I get it, he wants everyone to have all of the healthcare they need, paid for by the government. Wanting that, and making that happen, are two completely different things. It\u2019s not going to happen. Not in my lifetime. Not in his lifetime. If it does happen, there will be so many problems with it that anyone who voted for it will be voted out, and anyone who promises to repeal it will be voted in. (See: Obamacare.). It will cost too much, not do what it\u2019s supposed to do, and make the people who were happy with the old system unhappy with the new one. It will be actively and passively sabotaged by at least 30% of the population. And, when all is said and done, there will still be huge inequalities in the healthcare Americans get. The rich will still get better treatment, and the Democrats will still use that to stir their base to vote for them one more time. Not because Democrats will do anything for them, but because Democrats will give lip service to \u201cknocking down the rich a notch\u201d. To a progressive like Goldman, equal outcomes is paramount, even if everyone is equal at zero. Actually, he said something I agreed with just today: Let the Russians have Syria. He was talking about how Trump ordered an end to American support for Syrian rebels, effectively giving Putin and the Russians what they want in Syria. Goldman said: Great! Let the Russians have it. We shouldn\u2019t be there anyway. I totally agree. Goldman has his product to sell, just like everyone else. His product is progressive talking points. He picked a tough product to sell. Progressive talk radio has always struggled to find an audience. I guess he\u2019s making enough selling this product to support himself. Good for him. I like to congratulate successful people, not tear them down.

V Max Holloway .  lives in London . 277w ago. Yep. And if you go to some of the more trendy bars around town you can expect to pay £4-5 for a CAN of lager!. It is expensive because people will pay those prices. If people stopped paying that much for booze the price would go down, simples. Some smaller pubs, tucked out of the way will do you a pint for £3.50 though. Best bet is a Sam Smiths pub, only place I know you can get a 3quid pint that isn't a spoonies.  Raymond Burch .  english born and bred . 277w ago. The cost of anything is a function of a number of different factors. The cost of production - in the case of beer this includes the cost of staff and premises cost as well as the physical product. Desired profit margin. Production run - mass produced or craft? . What the competitors is charging. What the market will bear. In the case of pubs in London I would think that establishment costs (either directly in the form of rents or indirectly in the form of opportunity cost - what else can we do with this building and what income would it generate?) are very high and that this is a big factor in beer prices. Wetherspoons go for volume and thus can afford to charge less. For another slant on this you could look out the Undercover Economist by Tim Harford - there is a cracking chapter on why a cup of coffee is so expensive considering that its ingredients are cheap. UPDATE - got the reference wrong - it should have been Tim Harford, not the Freakonomics chaps.  Alexandre Coninx .  lived in London . 186w ago.  Everything is relative. Compared to France (or at least Paris) 4£ a pint of decent beer in a decent place is really cheap! And from what I was told it is even more expensive in some Northern Europe countries. .  Tomas Ruta .  Building models to solve the world's biggest problems fast and at scale. . 244w ago.  Alcohol is taxed heavily in the UK. .

V Karen Guenther . 76w ago. Yes, we do! We live in the high desert of Oregon where the climate is very dry, usually sunny, and often with a breeze from the south. Perfect conditions to dry clothes on the line. My mother actually really enjoys hanging the laundry out and wouldn't have it any other way, although we do have a dryer for times when it's just too cold or wet outside. But even then, we've been known to shovel a path through the snow to get out to the clothesline (now that's commitment). I will say that in many parts of the US, using a clothesline would be seen as "backward", looked at askance, or could even be against the neighborhood covenants, codes, and restrictions (CCRs) for interrupting sightlines (oh, the horror, someone can see your laundry!). Here in my town, a couple was sued by their homeowners association for hanging laundry in the open (The Right to Dry:. A Green Movement. Is Roiling America). This incident was so silly it made the national news, but that doesn't mean that she was allowed to continue hanging her laundry out. Eventually they sold their home and moved from the highly-restrictive neighborhood. There is a green movement to allow people to hang laundry in the open, regardless of whatever CCRs rule their neighborhood (19 'right to dry' states outlaw clothesline bans; is yours among them?). That doesn't mean people will suddenly run out and build clotheslines. I think that most people who work long hours will continue to use their dryers because it's simply easier. Clothesline work for sunny climates, homeowners with the space for them, and people who have time during the daylight hours to wash and hang laundry. Oh yeah, maybe also people who aren't worried about their neighbors seeing their "unmentionables" blowing in the breeze.  Jim Delaney .  I've seen a lot of behaviour. . 74w ago. Some people do, and some don't. It's cheaper to dry laundry on a line than in a dryer, but some communities ban the hanging out of washing or anything else deemed unsightly. A hotelier that I know always puts the hotel towels through the dryer because line drying leaves them hard, while the dryer makes them soft, which guests prefer.  Lorri Robinson .  I'm a human and I have behaviors . 76w ago. Of course. That\u2019s what clotheslines are for. I\u2019ve hung many a load of laundry outside, and hated every second of it. I love my dryer.

VChiclets, the candy-coated gum brought to us by the Cadbury company, brings back such great memories and flavors of my youth so when I stumbled upon this latest work for Chiclet by Cairo based Amro Thabit I just had to share. Introduced in 1900, this iconic gum is still distributed in limited supply across the globe. We're hoping Amro's work puts the brand back on the map in a bigger way for today's youth to appreciate. Scoop more on the project and corresponding work below. . ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN. CHICLETS, NEVER GETS OLD! chiclets has always had a place on every shelf; here, there & everywhere. the true definition of an all-time classic.. chiclets decided to embrace a young spirit sticking to its old soul. now targeting the younger generation, a more vibrant package design was born. by turning chiclets iconic half-circle into five different mouth-shaped designs. Inspired by the originality of the older packs, i took the existing undefined shape and transformed it into a mouth.To bring this further, i injected modern & personalized elements, giving the new packs a retro look; a look appreciated by teens. i gave each of the five flavors a personality, a distinct character, using differentiating colors & elements such as piercing, mustache, braces... The five packs are not only visually distinct; each one a character that is reflected by their look & speech. The one trait they all have in common is a sense of humor.

VPARIS (AP) \u2014 French police are deploying extra forces to western France before a government announcement Wednesday on whether to build an airport that has mobilized nearly a decade of sometimes violent protests. Hundreds of anarchists, farmers and environmental activists have occupied a vast area around Notre-Dame-des-Landes, outside the city of Nantes, to resist the proposed airport. Protesters from other regions have reportedly arrived in recent days. A security official said that extra gendarmes and riot police are being sent this week to the area, because police plan to try to clear out the protesters once the government makes a decision. An initial attempt, in the fall of 2012, to dislodge the squatters from the resistance community they created ended in a clash between hundreds of riot police and activists hurling sticks, stones and gasoline bombs. A 2014 protest in the town of Nantes which drew some 20,000 plus the anarchists also led to a violent standoff with police. President Emmanuel Macron's Cabinet is scheduled to discuss the airport at a meeting Wednesday. His office said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited Nantes over the weekend, will then announce the decision. Proponents argue the region needs a larger airport to boost its economic prospects. Opponents say the airport is unnecessary and a symbol of exploitative globalization. Farmers trying to protect their land, in some cases in the family for generations, have joined forces with the anarchists, who call themselves ZADists, based on the French acronym for "development zone.".

VWhatsApp appears to be testing a new feature aimed at trying to limit the spread of chain letter style spam messages and tackle viral fakes spreading on its platform. Two WhatsApp blog sites, Whatsappen.nl and WABetaInfo, report spotting notification messages in the app which appear intended to warns users that they are at risk of forwarding some spam \u2014 by displaying a notice that the message \u201chas been forwarded many times\u201d. A similar warning is also shown displayed on a frequently forwarded message when it\u2019s received, although the feature is described as still in development and it\u2019s not clear whether WhatsApp intends to officially roll it out or not. At the time of writing the company had not responded to our requests for confirmation that it\u2019s testing the anti-spam feature. Chain letter messages that contain \u2014 at best \u2014 nonsense claims, and which urge other WhatApp users to forward the message to all their contacts to keep amplifying the spread are a staple sight on the platform (and indeed also on Facebook where users can get asked to copy-paste and repost a spam status message to spread it). Such as the below example \u2014 which was circulating on the WhatsApp of a UK TechCrunch editor\u2019s child \u2014 which creatively reimagines the CEO of the company as an individual called \u2018Jim Balsamic\u2019\u2026. While these sorts of chain letters might seem like a pretty trivial form of fake news to worry about, the problem of false rumors spreading like lightning across WhatsApp\u2019s platform has been linked to far more serious consequences. In India, for example, fake rumors have reportedly triggered mob attacks that resulted in deaths and injuries. Religious and caste tensions in India and Burma have also been stoked by fake posts spread via social media, as the Washington Post reported recently. Other fake rumors spread via WhatsApp apparently thwarted a local government immunization drive. Last year Facebook took out full page adverts in Indian newspapers telling people how to spot fake news (something it also did in Europe ahead of elections). But stepping up technical anti-spam measures on its platforms to try to slow the spread of viral fakes seems like the responsible thing for the company to do given the very real risks attached to how its technology is accelerating misinformation.

V (The Ellen Show). Rob Lowe is doing his part to help the devastation in Montecito, California. The 53-year-old actor appeared on Thursday\u2019s "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" where he talked to his neighbor, DeGeneres, about the destruction in their California town. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really difficult week. The sadness, I can\u2019t get beyond it,\u201d Lowe admitted. \u201cI think people who live there, we kind of are holding onto each other,\u201d DeGeneres, who has also spoken to neighbor Oprah Winfrey about the disaster on the show, said. There are 20 dead and three still missing in Montecito with 179 homes destroyed and more than 200 homes damaged. Lowe explained that his son, Matthew, stayed behind the night of the mudslide as they were only under voluntary evacuation. A post shared by Rob Lowe (@robloweofficial) on Jan 15, 2018 at 5:29pm PST. \u201cI had a meeting out of town. At 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, I got a FaceTime from Matthew panicking\u2026 fires everywhere because gas lines were rupturing. It was like Armageddon,\u201d Lowe said. The actor believes that the reason the community suffered so many fatalities was due to confusion. . \u201cPeople who saw the fires, they woke up, went out to see what was going on and then were washed away. It was truly a perfect storm of bad events,\u201d he explained. DeGeneres noted that she\u2019s been told they have a mandatory evacuation in the area for possibly as long as March as they try to clean up the destruction. They also gave viewers two ways to donate to help with the cleanup \u2013 RedCrossMontecito.com and DeGeneres\u2019 Montecito Disaster Relief GoFundMe page.  With some very cute heroes: the emotional support dogs on the scene of the Montecito floods. A post shared by  Rob Lowe (@robloweofficial) on Jan 15, 2018 at 12:53pm PST. Lowe has been actively involved with the community cleanup, inviting local firefighters to his house for dinner and posing with a group of rescue dogs.

VTokyo-based architect and designer Emmanuelle Moureaux is known for creating multi-sensory installation art using bright colors as three-dimensional elements. For her latest project, as part of an ongoing 100 Colors series, Moureaux created her largest rainbow-hued art installation to date. Most recently on show at the Toyama Prefectural Museum of Art and Design in Toyama, Japan, the Color of Time installation comprises 120,000 number-shaped paper cut-outs that fill the entire room, and \u201cfloat\u201d in a three-dimensional, grid-like structure composed of 100 layers. Visitors are able to walk through the rows of floor-to-ceiling colored paper numbers that range from 0 to 9. Each row of numbers denotes a time of day, from sunrise at 6:30 a.m. to sunset at 7:49 p.m. As the viewer advances, the cut-outs gradually change in color from vibrant rainbow hues to darker shades, and eventually black, visualizing the passing of time from day into night. \u201cThrough the tunnel, the sky is tinted with a beautiful gradation changing from pale to deep colors, flowing from time to time,\u201d the museum explains. The sensory exhibition \u201cmakes one feel the subtle changes in [the] atmosphere through the whole body by traveling the colorful flow of time.\u201d. The installation closed on January 8, 2018 in Toyama; however, Moureaux is planning to exhibit 100 Colors in different cities around the world. Keep an eye on her Facebook and Instagram pages for announcements, as well as a behind-the-scenes look into the artist\u2019s colorful world. The Color of Time installation by Tokyo-based artist Emmanuelle Moureaux comprises 120,000 rainbow-colored paper number cut-outs. The floor-to-ceiling, three-dimensional grid-like structure visualizes the passing of time. Each row of numbers denotes a time of day and gradually changes color from vibrant rainbow hues, to darker shades, representing the transition from day to night.

V Greg Blandino .  works at Beijing, China . 10w ago. I bike past the Beijing Public safety Bureau\u2019s visa office to work everyday. I occasionally see people wearing burqas walking from the Yonghegong subways stop towards the visa office.  Steven Lee .  lived in China . 10w ago. It depends, but in China it is generally not a great idea to wear Burqa in public. Burqa was banned in Xinjiang Uyghur Prefecture according multiple news channel. Given that burqa was not traditional costume of Chinese Muslims , the Xinjiang regional government banned Burqa under the reason of antiextremism,which carried an implication that Beijing was out of patience and was seeking to halt expanding Arabic influence in the northwest. So if you wear Burqa at public places in Xinjiang, be prepared to be detained. In anywhere else, Burqa was technically not banned, I guess it should be fine since this law was not extended to nationwide and I have witnessed someone wore this in Honghe Yunnan Province per se,. Footnote: Hijab was not banned.

VThe Yakuza franchise is a long-standing series that is known for its powerful crime-laden characters but also for its hilarious randomness seen in-games. This is most prevalent in the mini-games often featured in the Yakuza series and SEGA has released a brand new trailer showing off what the 6th game has in store - and it doesn't disappoint. Pet-able kittens, random babies, those sick, sick dad bods ... the latest trailer has it all and you can check it out for yourself in the video up top. . The latest trailer is perfect for those that want to work on their fitness but don't actually want to go anything, as the gym mini-game so eloquently shows. Even if you're not huge into the Yakuza franchise, the video is worth it just to watch Kiryu strum it up on the ukulele. Regardless of which mini-game tickled your fancy the most, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life is available now in Japan, with a March 20th NA and EU release this year on PlayStation. "In Yakuza 6, Kazuma Kiryu will find out exactly how much people are willing to sacrifice for family - be those ties through blood or bond - when he investigates a series of shadowy events that involve the ones he holds closest to his heart. Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring. From the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.".

V Daniel Kinzler .  hacking since 4th grade . 220w ago.  You shouldn't implement a search algorithm yourself, especially not in PHP, for a large data set. Best either use the database's build in full text indexing features (see e.g. MySQL's Full-Text Search Functions) or use a dedicated search engine such as Sphinx or Solr. .  Debojit Kakoti .  DevOps Engineer . 132w ago.  Which database are you using. If you are using mysql than you can do mysql indexing on the search column @8.3 Optimization and Indexes . You can also use memcahed to store all those data which are frequently searched. @a distributed memory object caching system. You no need to implement algorithm for that. You have to fine tune your database and relations between tables or use memcahed like memory caching system. .  Jees K Denny .  Passionate Computer Science Student . 75w ago. In Mysql, There are two options i listed here. Refer these links, You get more information.  Viraj Kadam .  5 Years Experience of Web Applications Development . 55w ago. Efficient u said\u2026. I have created a logically faster way to get data by dividing the tables and column to possiblly find the correct and accuratly only search in required resulting in avoiding unnecessary traversing time.. saving us tons of processing power and time of execution. Don\u2019t forget to fork.  Art Kagel .  studied Computer Science & Mathematics at NYU Tandon School of Engineering (1977) . 40w ago. Let tbe database do the searching.  Sooraj Randhir Singh .  Btech Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, Amity University (2018) . 24w ago. use something like this for the simplest use. $query = "select * from explore where site_name like '%".$searchterm."%' or other_column like '%".$searchterm."%'"; .

VThroughout the past few months, Southern California has had to deal with a lot of natural disasters. For weeks, wildfires blazed through entire towns, and people were forced to evacuate their homes. Now, heavy rains have caused mudslides of epic proportions. More than a dozen people have already died, and more are missing. Of course, it\u2019s important to look for the heroes in devastating times like this, the people who are helping others despite the risk of danger. Recently, the Coast Guard was able to rescue a family of five that was stranded on a roof. The family had climbed to the top of their house after mud, water, and debris filled their home. The Coast Guard, who arrived by helicopter, lowered two members down to the house on a rope, where they started helping the family. The first rescue was the mom and an infant. Next, they recovered two young kids, then the dad. But before the Coast Guard was able to leave the side of the mudslides, the family begged them to rescue their two other family members: their beloved dogs. Watch the video below to see the Coast Guard members recount the harrowing rescue. If you\u2019re looking to help the victims of the California mudslides, please consider donating blood to those in need. Footage provided by KGTV San Diego. Thumbnail Photo: KGTV San Diego.

V Chester Hall .  Have studied Self-Help/Personal Development leaders since 2008 . 113w ago. Why don't people share their goals with others?. It's real simple...I don't wholly believe in my goals, so I refuse to share them with others. And/or, I think that you will laugh at my goals. I take my goals personally and, if you are laughing at my goals, then you are laughing at me. . That's it!.  Raj Kamal Roye Baro .  Can't deliver the best but try my best . 113w ago. Original question - Why don't people share their goals with others?. If I tell someone that I'm going to find a treasure full of gold which is situated inside the bunker of an old farm house and tell him that I'll be rich will you think he will be happy to hear such a news and leave me alone to my quest for treasure hunt? Obviously he will be also be the part of this chase and even if you manage to get the treasure there's no gaurantee if you reach a bank or a museum safely.

VHi, everyone. My name is Constanza Andrea Fuentes Ojeda; I\u2019m into surrealist-oneiric art (which contains a glum touch) since I was 16. It was a bit hard at first because I fell for art only by expressing myself and everything was fully connected to my feelings and to the internal pain I felt by that time, in fact, I didn\u2019t reveal my real name and I used to call myself LOS, because I didn\u2019t want anybody to realize that it was me. Today, I\u2019m 21 and I\u2019m able to say openly who I am: Coni Fuentes, the person who knew art as a way of channeling her internal conflicts. This project became a wonderful and indescribable passion because of everything that I\u2019ve experienced in my life and it opened the gates of my mind to depict in paper sheets those little pieces of emotions that affect me, which shape into unimaginable forms. Now, I want you to know my own world, because even though it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s full of infinite possibilities. You only need to hear it and observe it carefully because I honestly want you to know there\u2019s something else beyond what you\u2019re able to see: dreams, strange creatures, games or nightmares; deep concepts, magical places plus thousands of extravagant and disproportionate things you\u2019ll find in my art. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank anyone who takes time to read and know more about my universe, which for many people is imaginary but to me, it\u2019s real.

V (NAN).  A mostly Muslim county in western China has banned children from attending religious events over a winter break, an education bureau said in a notice posted online, as authorities step up control of religious education.  According to a notification by the district education bureau, school students in Linxia county in Gansu province, home to many members of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority, are prohibited from entering religious buildings over their break.  The bureau said students must also not read scriptures in classes or in religious buildings, the bureau said, adding that all students and teachers should heed the notice and work to strengthen political ideology and propaganda.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the notice.  A man who answered the telephone at the Linxia education bureau hung up when Reuters asked about the notice.  A woman at the district education bureau declined to comment on the document\u2019s authenticity.  Xi Wuyi, a Marxist scholar at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Scientists and an outspoken critic of rising Islamic influence in China, shared the picture and welcomed the apparent move by the authorities.  With the notice, the county was taking concrete action to keep religion and education separate and sticking strictly to education law, she said on the Weibo social media platform.  New regulations on religious affairs released in October last year, and due to take effect in February, aim to.  increase oversight of religious education, and provide for greater regulation of religious activities.  Last summer, a Sunday School ban was introduced in the southeastern city of Wenzhou, sometimes known as \u201cChina\u2019s Jerusalem\u201d due to its large Christian population, but Christian parents found ways to teach their children about their religion regardless.  Chinese law officially grants religious freedom for all but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education or to \u201ccoerce\u201d children to believe.  Authorities in troubled parts of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslim minority, ban children from attending religious events.  Religious communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.  The Chinese-speaking Hui, who are culturally more similar to the Han Chinese majority than to Uighurs, have also come under scrutiny from some intellectuals who fear creeping Islamic influence on society.

V Michael J. McFadden .  A Quoran by any other name writes as sweet(ly)... . 41w ago. Dunno about in general, but my stats show 3,000 Answers and 300 Questions. Generally the questions are ones that I have not been able to track down good answers to with Google searching research efforts. Occasionally they\u2019ve been ones where there IS good info out on Google, but I felt I\u2019d get more authoritative and detailed information on the particular point I needed from some of the experts here on Quora. And sometimes they\u2019re just very strange questions that have bugged the back of my brain for years\u2026 e.g.:. MJM, who also sometimes has Questions pop into his mind while answering other related Questions here\u2026.  Subhasish Ghosh .  Oxoniensis (2006). Technocrat. Lectiophile. Traveler. . 3w ago. Thanks for A2A. Most Quora Top Writers purely write answers on Quora. In other words; they are passionate about producing quality answers to the existing repository of questions already instead of adding more questions. There are definitely exceptions; but most of them whom I have come across purely writer answers only.  Jennifer Ellis .  I have been answering questions on Quora for several years now. . 41w ago. I do not. Generally, if I have questions I answer them in one of several ways:. I look for the answer myself through research. I ask people I know and respect. A combination of the two.

VJeff Bracken, Lexus Group Vice President and General Manager, accepted the award at NAIAS.  Every year, Autoblog editors test dozens and dozens of the newest vehicles available, sometimes even before they're available. From those vehicles, we select the ones we think provide the most innovative technology in the industry. Then we pare the list down to the very best, test them again, and vote on our winner for Technology of the Year. This year, Lexus's multi-stage hybrid system \u2014 as tested in the LC 500h \u2014 came out ahead of the rest of the finalists.  We chose the 2018 Detroit Auto Show to hand over the award to Lexus Group Vice President and General Manager Jeff Bracken. He was kind enough to sit down with Autoblog Senior Editor Alex Kierstein and Green Editor John Snyder at the Lexus stand to talk about the hybrid system, what it does, and what it means for the future of Lexus and Toyota.  Check out the video above, and follow along for all our coverage from the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where we are taking a look at all of the new cars and technology that we'll see in the near future. Perhaps the next winner of Autoblog's Technology of the Year award is sitting somewhere on the Detroit show floor.

VI'm A Survivor, Not Gonna Give Up. In Metal Gear Survive, the lost members of Mother Base will do whatever it takes to endure in a hostile alternate-dimension populated with dangerous zombie-like creatures and other enemy combatants. Focusing more on survival and resource-gathering as opposed to the series' familiar stealth-action gameplay, players will have to scrounge for supplies, craft new gear and equipment, and rescue other survivors across the lands. While Survive retains much of the core mechanics found from Metal Gear Solid V, it goes about its core gameplay a bit differently, tasking players to strengthen their character and their base with the materials procured out in the field. In the early hours, you'll find yourself in the role of the Survivor, one of four unique classes in Metal Gear Survive. But as you advance in rank and acquire more resources, you'll unlock additional classes that open up new skills and upgrade the core attributes--strength, vitality, dexterity, and endurance--for your character. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the starting Survivor class--including the perks and bonuses that can be unlocked. Be sure to visit us for more Metal Gear Survive content as we near its February 20 release. Moreover, check out our video of GameSpot editors Miguel Concepcion and Matt Espineli offering up their impressions based on the early hours of Metal Gear Survive. Strength.

VMaj.-Gen. Lucky Irabor, the Task Force Commander, Multi National Joint Task Force, has reiterated the commitments of the military to the restoration of peace in the Lake Chad region.  Irabor told newsmen shortly after a meeting with Maj.-Gen. Rogers Nicholas, the Theatre Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole, in Maiduguri, that the ongoing military operations achieved stability in the war ravaged region.  He said: We are fighting terrorism and insurgency.  \u201cTerrorism does not have respect for any border and that is the reason why for those of us in the Multi National Joint Task Force, we feel that we need to interact with national operation commanders.  \u201cTo share information and thought regarding what we are doing and to encourage each other regarding the operation in general.  \u201cWe are moving from one level to the high level, you will agree with me that stability is beginning to return to the Lake Chad basin by virtue of the operations we are conducting.  \u201cThere is going to be cross border commerce. Trade is going to increase; movement of persons, socio-economic activities is also going to escalate.  \u201cAnd of course these are the indicators of what impact the operations we are conducting will have. These are things that I believe all those residing in the Lake Chad Commission countries should expect.\u201d.  Irabor added the command would continue its support to military authorities in the Lake Chad Basin Commission states in the ongoing clearance operations to route out remnant of the Boko Haram insurgents.  Also speaking, Rogers explained that the Nigerian military in collaboration with MNJTF were conducting various operations against the insurgents.  Rogers added that the troops had intensified offensive against the insurgents, noting that the ongoing operation DEEP PUNCH II would soon be concluded.  The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the MNJTF with its headquarters in Ndjemena, Chad was constituted by LCBC states, to fight Boko haram insurgency.  The participating states are Nigeria, Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin Republics.  Nigerian troops under Operation DEEP PUNCH rescued about 1, 000 persons from Boko Haram captivity in Lake Chad region in the past two weeks.

At the 2018 Detroit Auto Show, BMW displayed two new models. Along with the refreshed i8 Coupe, the Bavarian automaker added a new crossover to its lineup, the X2. Photos have been circulating for a while, and we even got some early specs for the compact crossover. Now, we've seen the dapper little ute in person, and have the full rundown available.  Based on the X1 compact crossover, the sleeker X2 will launch in the U.S. as the turbo-four, all-wheel-drive xDrive28i, hitting dealerships on March 3, 2018. It offers 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, and does 0-60 miles per hour in 6.3 seconds. It will be followed soon after by the X2 sDrive28i. It will launch in Europe with the sDrive20i, xDrive20d and xDrive25d. More engine and transmission combinations will follow.  Of course, the X2 includes the newest technologies to make the car smarter and easier to use. It features an optional 8.8-inch iDrive touchscreen display. BMW Connected and ConnectedDrive are available (including Apple CarPlay), as is a heads-up display. The camera-based Driver Assistant Plus system includes a Traffic Jam Assistant, which helps manage driving duties in stop-and-go traffic. It also features an optional Parking Assistant that recognizes parking spaces and steers the car into the spot.  The X2 will offer optional M Sport and M Sport X versions, with unique styling and sportier suspension setups. They'll feature the M Sport suspension, which lowers the ride height and firms up the spring and damper settings. Also on offer is the optional Dynamic Damper Control, which provides more control over suspension settings and drops the ride height by 0.4 inches. These versions will also feature interior trim combining BMW's Micro Hexagon fabric and Alcantara Anthracite.  Pricing and fuel economy figures for the BMW X2 will be announced later.

The next morning, they fill up with passengers on the first flights out. Charter aircraft will be hooked up to a tug and parked to one of 75 remote parking stands at LHR. During the day, airlines aren\u2019t crazy. They fly into an airport with passengers, and fly right back out with passengers that now need to depart back home or on the next leg of the journey of the airplane\u2019s scheduled routing. Airplanes sitting empty during peak hours is bleeding the airline of revenue. Load them up with a new flight crew and they are put into service asap. Especially LHR. Airlines don\u2019t get landing and departure slots if they aren\u2019t going to use them efficiently for this airport. LHR\u2019s operating efficiency and capacity rating is 98% for 330 days of the year. The other days are below average because of weather or air traffic delays elsewhere in the network. The same is true for the top dozen airports around the world.  Dan Pepper .  Logged a few million miles with a carry-on bag. . 85w ago. At Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the largest equipment, the Airbus A380, will be moved off the gate to the western perimeter of the airport for servicing:.  Alec Cawley .  Liberal software engineer with a physics degree . 85w ago. There are indeed remote stands at LHR. The airline will try to schedule complementary flights, so an aircraft that has just done a \u201clong\u201d cycle will then do a \u201cshort\u201d cycle, to make a balanced cycle. But they will certainly not leave an aircraft on the gate for eight hours. They get a certain amount of gate time \u201cfree\u201d with the landing fees, but after that time they will be charged for occupying the gate, and will therefore tow the aircraft off to remote parking. But generally, they work hard to keep the aircraft in the air, earning money, not at the gate, costing money.

V Henrik Becker .  lives in The Netherlands (1984-present) . 32w ago. There\u2019s a few ways to camp in the Netherlands. First and foremost, be aware that just putting your tent in a random spot (\u201cwild camping\u201d as we call it) is illegal. However! If you take a look at this map it shows you \u201csemi-wild\u201d camping places. The national service that takes care of our forests and nature sites (\u201cStaatsbosbeheer\u201d) has put markers in place. These are legal campsites without any facilities. Of course, since there aren\u2019t that many, chances are it will feel more like a campsite. Then there\u2019s legal campsites in designated areas. The comment above me mentioned $30 a night, but in my experience there\u2019s plenty that will go for $15\u201320 bucks (well, euros). They\u2019re usually well maintained and pleasant to stay at. Finally, another idea is to ask a farmer if you can stay on his land. Many of them will quite willingly let you stay in one of their meadows or the forested areas of their land. And in general, you\u2019ll find the Netherlands a lovely place to be in summer. I\u2019d recommend vacationing here and discovering the flat countryside, the many forested areas and characteristic, culturally attractive towns.  Omar Sirre .  Youth Professional . 32w ago. It definitely is! The country is the Netherlands or Nederland though. Camping is very popular and you'll find camp sites all over the country. Although you might expect it to be, it really is not cheap at all. A night at a camp site with your tent, a car and two persons might easily set you back around 30 dollars. I would however recommend it because is the easiest way to meet a lot of people. Especially for children it's a great way to spend the holidays in nature, around a swimming pool and with lots of other children.

V Hurricanes, deadly floods, drought and wildfires across the world as global temperatures hit new highs . 2017 is set to be confirmed as the warmest year on record not influenced by warming El Niño conditions. Preliminary data suggests the global CO2 emissions grew in 2017 by around 2% after three-year \u2018plateau\u2019. . 2017 was the third-hottest year on record in the U.S. and the most expensive in terms of #climate disasters, according to NOAA</a>: <a href="https://t.co/eyUMUL0whM">https://t.co/eyUMUL0whM</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/mongabay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">mongabay pic.twitter.com/YgTZFqiKas. \u2014 Yale Program on Climate Change Communication (@YaleClimateComm) 14 janvier 2018 . Observations show the average of the past five years was an estimated 1.1°C warmer than the pre-industrial value. In 2017, hurricanes wreaked havoc from the Caribbean to Ireland. More than 1,200 people have died in flooding across India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Drought affected East Africa and the western United States. Prolonged dry conditions in southern Europe led to water shortages and wildfires. . Europe in 2017 was generally warmer than the long-term average, particularly in the far north. Sea-ice cover was notably below average. December was particularly warm in eastern Europe, with lower than average temperatures in the southwest.

V Ritchie Strachan .  General Practioner with special interest in ICU & ER . 108w ago. You no longer have the signs and symptoms of the disease. So no more abdominal pain, no more blood or mucus in your stools. Maybe you start gaining weight, or growing (if you are a child).  Liang-Hai Sie .  Retired general internist, former intensive care physician. . 80w ago. The patient having no more symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever and normal blood tests for ESR, CRP, albumin.  Mirna Almaz .  Kicking Crohns in the Butt for 11 Years :) . 61w ago. I knew I was in remission when I drank coffee and didn\u2019t run to the WC 2min later. I gained a lot of weight too. I was happy. Here is what I think are the signs:. If you are fine after eating everything you couldn\u2019t eat before. if you have energy and aren\u2019t worn out all the time anymore. if you can run a mile without collapsing. if you do not poop 100 times a day. if your stool is now a solid. if you are in a good jolly mood. then congratulations! You are in remission :).  Ian Rothman .  Diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2007. . 93w ago.  Remission is a significant decrease in symptoms over a long period of time. .

VTRIPOLI (Reuters) - The only functioning airport in Libya\u2019s capital Tripoli remained shut for a third day on Wednesday after fierce clashes between armed groups damaged planes belonging to all four of the airlines that operate there. . The fighting erupted on Monday after one of the city\u2019s many armed groups launched an attack at Mitiga Airport in an apparent effort to secure the release of prisoners held in an adjacent prison. At least 20 people were killed and 60 wounded. . \u201cMitiga\u2019s air space remains closed and it is up to the authorities to decide when it will be reopened,\u201d the airport administration said in a short statement on Wednesday. . Petro Air, which operates flights to Libyan oil fields, also said all its flights at Mitiga were still suspended. . A number of planes parked there were damaged during the clashes, including an A319 Airbus belonging to Afriqiyah Airlines, an Airbus A330 operated by Libyan Airlines, two Boeings operated to Buraq Air, and two jets operated by Libya Wings. . Some aircraft were moved for safety reasons across the capital to Tripoli\u2019s international airport, which has been closed since 2014 due to damage from earlier fighting. .

V Josh Osborne .  Former Apple employee (for ~decade), I don't speak for them . 19w ago. Depending on what you mean by \u201cSafari\u201d it could be because \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d because Safari is basically a bunch of UI code that leaves all the heavy lifting to WebKit, or because WebKit is pretty problematic to rewrite. WebKit is cross platform, and has a lot of use outside Apple\u2019s ecosystem (and WebKit is largely C++). Apple use to get a huge amount of milage out of this because Apple was a bit player and any extra WebKit adoption helped. This might not be a big motivator for Apple any more as everyone wants stuff to work on iOS. Apple also has a very strong desire for WebKit to keep (or improve!) the current level of performance, and power efficiency. The power efficiency is a big deal because their laptop and phone \u201chours of battery life under light/heavy activity\u201d include a substantial amount of time in Safari (and rightly so, people spend a lot of time in Safari). WebKit is also huge. It also includes things you wouldn\u2019t expect, like a compiler (JavaScript has an interpreter, and if the JS runs for \u201ca little while\u201d it is handed off to a sort of a byte code compiler\u2026and if it keeps going, it gets handed off to LLVM to generate machine code\u2026there might be yet another level of compiler in there too). So you have large effort, and high stakes on the one hand, and on the other hand you have\u2026um\u2026not much. Bragging rights? A little more operational experience? They could get that with less risky projects. Or even just doing new things in Swift and leaving the old ones in whatever.  Nikola Stojakovi\u0107 .  Journalist at Pan\u010devo City (2017-present) . 19w ago. Because rewriting software costs money and time. You need to work on implementing same features in different manner. You have huge codebase which is written by lots of developers. Some parts are probably not well documented, but if you left them out you\u2019ll eventually break something. Rewriting application in another language is in fact the last thing you want to consider doing, and only in special cases (for example, support is not available from tech vendor or you need to add feature which wouldn\u2019t be possible on your current architecture or take you much more time and money than just changing technology).  Ben Reimers .  Retail Manager . 19w ago. A few reasons I imagine:. It's a huge code base. That took many years to develop. That would takes years to fully refactor. For no discernible benefit.

V Kevin ONeil .  Ph.D. Public Admin & Psychology, University of Southern California . 55w ago. Normally, snipers are positioned in locations of concealment. Sometimes, with added camouflage and with a distance advantage. Often with a \u201cspotter.\u201d. The longer they maintain a firing position the greater the chance at discovery. Some locations are ideal for sniper positioning, however, their target knows that as well and the target(s) are constantly scanning for sniper location. It\u2019s an odds game with high risks and great rewards for the skilled sniper. Snipers can obviously get killed or wounded by IED\u2019s, collateral damage due to bombings, aerial firings and OTHER side snipers that are hunting them.  James Howlett .  Curious about anything and everything. . 54w ago. Snipers are marksmen who keep a visual track on their target from a distance. The target is oblivious of the sniper\u2019s position, in the same way a sniper could be a target too of another sniper or the covert position of the sniper has been located or could get killed in a bombing event or missile attack.

V NP Prasad .  Spent a lot of my life waiting at airports for the next flight.... . 67w ago. As it is same airline, you need to stay inside the transit area and depending on the distance between the two gates ( arrival and departure boarding gate) it could be anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. As it is the same airline the staff will have prior information of your connection and will guide you to move quickly to avoid delays.  Rasika Sethi .  lived in New Delhi . 1w ago. GMR, DIAL is having inter connected shuttle bus service from Terminal 3 to Terminal C and D almost after every 30 mins or 1 hr. You just have to show your boarding card and board the shuttle bus. If you have shortage of time and you cant wait for shuttle bus the best way to take OLA, Uber, pre-paid taxi or any other taxi like Meru outside the airport. You will reach there in 15 minutes.

VOyo town. PHOTO: Flickr. As part of measures to honour the foremost translator of the Bible to Yoruba language and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, Christian leaders across the country have being charged to organize an annual assembly of Christians at his Osoogun hometown in Iseyin local government area of Oyo State. . The founder of Jesus is Saviour Amen Ministry, Bishop Daniel Mudashiru Balogun, called on Christian leaders, particularly those who make use of the Yoruba Bible to gather at least once a year at Crowther\u2019s hometown to unite and pray for the progress of the country and Christendom at large. Balogun said promoting the legacy of the illustrious clergyman in the community is a fitting tribute to the memory of Crowther. Osoogun, which is significant for housing a lot of missionaries, chapels and churches, has being in a deplorable state for decades, \u201cmore reason why we should promote this community and attract government\u2019s attention to the area,\u201d Balogun added. Meanwhile, a community leader in Osoogun, Chief Moses Oyebanji Alabi II, has pledged to provide at least five acres of land for the annual gathering. Alabi believes a gathering like this is long overdue and sees it as a way of developing the community. According to him, Osoogun is ready to host all Christians and serve as home for all. Also, chairman of Osoogun Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Evang. Segun Ayoola, has welcomed the development and pledged their support towards making it a reality. Ayoola also proposed that a council of Christian leaders across the country, particularly the Yoruba speaking churches should be inaugurated to work assiduously towards actualizing the project.

VIf you simply want to take in the sights, this mode is for you. The variety of historical settings of Assassin's Creed games has always been one of the highlights of the series, as it's fascinating to explore a dynamic, living recreation of Victorian England or Ancient Egypt. Previously, however, if you simply wanted to explore the cities and environments of the games, you still had to put up with some combat and storyline. Today, Ubisoft announced the release date and price for a new mode, called Discovery Tour, for Assassin's Creed Origins that allows players to learn more about Ancient Egypt without the pressure of questlines or combat. It's designed specifically as an educational experience, and it'll let you see the entire world at your own pace. There are two main components to Discovery Tour. First, the mode opens up the entire world to free-roaming, and quests and combat are turned off. This way, players can simply wander through the cities, villages, and deserts to see what Ancient Egypt might have been like. Secondly, Ubisoft will also add daily guided tours to the game to provide players with a way to gain specific knowledge of Egyptian society and history. These tours will be curated by historians and Egypt experts. Discovery Tour will be available as a free update to anyone who owns Assassin's Creed Origins on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on February 20. In addition, it'll be available as a standalone download for $20 only on PC. In other news, Ubisoft announced that the first piece of DLC is coming to Assassin's Creed Origins on January 23. Called The Hidden Ones, it adds a new region, storyline, weapons, and more. In addition, a new patch was released today that improves the behavior of tamed animals and allows you to sell back outfits, among other things.

V Umar Jara .  Current High School Junior . 80w ago. Based on Apple's website ( https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/st... ), they do not offer programs for high school students and the earliest you can get one is while doing your undergraduate. The only time I could find them hiring a high school intern was in this article: http://iphone.appleinsider.com/a... . This was a very specific incident and I don't think you would want to replicate it just for an internship... Here's a bit of the article:.  Paul Houle, who plays football with a school in Massachussetts, said that he checked his heart rate on the Watch after suffering chest and back pain following a practice, according to CBS SF. The Watch claimed his rate was 145 for two hours after practice, which prompted him to go the hospital... .  News of the incident reached Cook, who called Houle directly to make the job and phone offers. . ("The Watch" being an Apple watch and Tim Cook personally offered him a summer internship over the phone and an iPhone).  Those are just within the first few search results off of Google and you can surely find many more with keywords like "high school technology internships". Hope this helped! .

VPope Francis has publically expressed 'pain and shame' over the rape and molestation of children by priests in Chile. His remarks came during his visit to the Latin American country which has been gripped by a scandal scarring the credibility of the Church. The pontif also had a private meeting with some of the victims and addressed the issue of abuse during a Mass in Santiago:. "These moments of turbulence. I know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil. (...) That is why ask you all to ask God to give us the lucidity in his name, for the courage to ask for forgiveness and to listen to what God is telling us.". The scandal centres on the pope's appointment in 2015 of Bishop Juan barros to head the small diocese of Osorno in southern Chile. Parishioners in the southern Chilean city say Bishop Barros used his position in the Church to try to block an investigation into the actions of his mentor, Catholic priest Fernando Karadima. Karadima was found guilty of abusing teenage boys over mny years. He has denied the allegations and Barros says he was unaware of any wrongdoing. Despite the scandal and some incidences of churches being attacked by vandals, the welcome most Chileans have given Francis has been warm with tens of thousands lining the streets. .

VNaomi Watts and Liev Schreiber maintain a friendly relationship. The exes were spotted bundled up and walking one of their rescue dogs in New York City together on Tuesday. The 49-year-old actress stepped out in jeans and a mustard-colored sweater with a light gray coat, striped scarf and purple beanie. The Ray Donovan star was casual in jeans, a forest green puffer jacket and gray beanie while walking one of the former couple's dogs. Alo Ceballos/GC Images. Watts and Schreiber confirmed their split in September 2016 after 11 years together. The two share 10-year-old son Sasha and 9-year-old son Kai. In September, Schreiber adopted two dogs while he was waiting backstage before his appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan. The pups were brought to the show by Home For Good Dog Rescue, an organization that raised awareness about the animals displaced by Hurricane Harvey. The actor FaceTimed his ex and their two sons before settling on two little dogs. ET chatted with Schreiber in December where he talked about his "viral" puppy adopting moment. "I think everybody, justifiably, felt like whatever we could do during that period of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, people related to that," he explained. "For me, I was just looking to get a puppy and I was really grateful to the show for providing the opportunity. Maybe that resonated with people. I\u2019m sure now, more than ever, people in Southern California are thinking similar thoughts and hopefully everything can help out a little bit because it\u2019s devastating what\u2019s happened.".

VA zoo in Sweden has put down nine healthy lion cubs since 2012 because they could not afford to keep them. Borås Djurpark resorts to the controversial practice if the animals cannot be moved to other zoos or if they are rejected by their group. The zoo\u2019s CEO Bo Kjellson told Swedish broadcaster SVT: \u201cI think they were killed after two years.". \u201cAt that time we had tried to sell or relocate them to other zoos for a long time but unfortunately there were no zoos that could receive them, and when the aggressions became too big in the group we had to remove some animals. And then it had to be them.\u201d. Of the thirteen cubs born in three litters at the zoo since 2012, only two have survived. Two of them died of natural causes, but the rest were put down. Borås Zoo was founded in 1962. It looks after 600 animals of 65 different species, most of which are born in captivity, and numerous breeding programs are run to maintain its genetically-varied wildlife population. But when the animals are no longer needed, Kjellson said it would be normal for them to be euthanized if they could not be rehomed. Bo Kjellson, the CEO of Borås Djurpark. He said: \u201cIt's no secret in any way and we do not try to hide that we're working this way. So it's unfortunately a natural path for groups of lions.\u201d. Helena Pedersen, a researcher in critical animal studies, told SVT that the practice of putting down healthy animals in zoos may surprise the public. "It is clear that there is a contrast to the public's perception of what a zoo is. To kill animals as part of the organization, I think that upsets quite a few. "I think we need to contemplate on why it's important for us to have zoos and if it's worth the price the animals pay for it.". When asked what might happen to the remaining lion cubs at Borås Zoo, Kjellson was unsure. He told SVT: "That we will see in the future. Currently, the group works well, but some of them may become surplus animals, and then we will try to place them elsewhere. "It could be so that we have to put them to death".

V Adrienne Friedberg .  Years of research and experimentation have paid off; my 3 daughters, all their friends, my friends- the one... . 97w ago. Yes. Tanning beds mimic the sun's ultra-violet rays to stimulate the production of melanin in your skin. Think of freckles as concentrated bundles of melanin hiding in the deep layers of the dermis waiting to protect your skin by darkening it. You weren't born with freckles, they only show up once they've been invited, and they never leave.  Lisa Malone .  Beauty product researcher, tried and tested most of them. . 98w ago.  Yes, tanning can give you freckles which is one of the reasons that it is so important to wear the appropriate protection for your method of tanning. Tanning can even make existing freckles appear worse, and make hidden or light freckles much more obvious. While the UV rays are interacting with your skin pigment, the rays do not ignore the already-darker spots. There are wonderful tanning products on the market, and are much safer for you. My favorite tanning moose to date is CB coco brown, goes on dark so you won't mess it up, developes after 1hour and can be washed off, oh leave it on over night and it will continue to darken. Hope this answer helps you. .  Jason Westenhofer .  15 years as a physician assistant, working in an internal medicine subspecialty. . 66w ago. Yes, those who freckle easily will get more if they lay in the tanning bed. Know what else they'll get? Skin cancer. Basal or squamous if you're lucky. Melanoma if you're unlucky. Stay out of tanning beds. Even if you're lucky enough not to get skin cancer, the photo damage from all that UV radiation will make you look much older than you really are.

V Kevin Coe .  Web application solution designer for 15+ years. . 245w ago. There are really two points to skeuomorphism. 1. Borrow meaning and knowledge of use. 2. Generate comfort / emotion. When you design something in the digital world to look like something in the real world, you are bridging a familiarity gap with your user. You are borrowing their knowledge of some physical mechanism to help them understand and control a digital one. This is also sometimes called design by metaphor or analogy and is at least as old as "files" and "folders" in computer design. There are no folders on computers, there are groupings of things that were convenient to call folders because it borrowed meaning from paper filing systems. It taught people in one word a number of things about interacting with the objects. Skeuomorphism has extended those kinds of basic analogies into a more complete illusion of the physical mechanisms. The more complete the illusion, the more knowledge you borrow. Perhaps more importantly, as that illusion becomes more immersive, you also borrow emotion. People may associate feelings of comfort from familiarity with a physical object. An interface that feels just like that familiar object can borrow not just knowledge but also emotion. There are really two reasons to avoid skeuomorphism. 1. Clutter. 2. Mechanical limitations. Making digital things look like physical things can involve eating up screen real estate and processing time for that purpose. As users become familiar with operating a type of software the physical elements of the design become less necessary. The ratio of the price of those elements versus the value to the user gets worse. The physical analogy also imposes certain assumed limits of the interface as well. When files go into "folders" then they can only ever be in one folder at a time, because a piece of paper can only be in one folder. In the digital world that's an unnecessary restriction. "Labels" replace that idea with a new analogy that allows files to "be" in many places, and search replaces any sort of grouping control with dynamic grouping based on anything in the document. So really, the question comes down to whether it's more important to teach people how to use your software in a comfortable way or more important to streamline the interface and remove limitations.

V Liang-Hai Sie .  retired general internist, former intensive care physician. . 58w ago. In the hot sunny climes of the Middle East many young healthy people have been shown to be low on vitamin D see Prevalence and risk factors for low vitamin D status among breastfeeding mother-infant dyads in an environment with abundant sunshine. and Prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency in qatar: a systematic review. It hasn\u2019t been proven that this deficiency is due to the wearing of a hijab or burkha, just a very strong correlation (see further). At the turn of the 20 to 21th century we began to read report on Pakistani women living in the UK developing severe vitamin D deficiency leading to osteomalacia and bone pain e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc... Since almost all the daily intake of Vitamin D is from sunlight, exposure there is significant concern for women who wear the burqa or "full hijab". This style of dress, leaving only a very small portion of skin around the eyes exposed, greatly reduces the surface area of the body which sunlight is exposed to and hence reduces the amount of Vitamin D synthesized. Such low rates of Vitamin D production will quickly exhaust the bodies excess emergency stores of Vitamin D contained in the fat and the person will likely go into a deficient state. Due to this reason, serious vitamin D deficiency is wide-spread in many Muslim majority countries. A study performed by doctors at King Fahd University Hospital in Saudi Arabia, showed that out of all 52 women tested, all had seriously deficient levels of Vitamin D and were at risk of many serious health problems, despite living in one of the sunniest places on the planet. Furthermore, in a study undertaken in Jordan, 83.3% of women wearing the most covering style of Islamic dresses were found to be deficient in summer time. This is rather striking when compared to the fact only 18.2% of Jordanian men studied were found to be deficient. Jordan, like Saudi Arabia, holds the distinction of being one of the sunniest places on the planet, so the effect of wearing the burqa on Vitamin D levels and health is profound. This is how exposure to sunlight produces vitamin D3 in our skin. We need 800 IU/day.  Jack Hathcoat . 58w ago. Any clothing blocks Vitamin-D absorption by preventing exposure to the sun. I realize this contradicts religious beliefs, however, it would be prudent for the sake of good health to seek sun exposure in some private manner that does not conflict with these beliefs.

VMoment when a woman was run over by a car, not once but twice, and miraculously survived to tell the tale. The incident apparently happened in China, and the video has gone viral on social media. The video was shared by CGTN, a cable channel, on Twitter shows how a woman, identified as Ms Nan was hit by a car as she was crossing the street during the morning rush hour. Although the driver immediately rushed out and helped her, she was hit again the moment they took her out from under the car since the driver had not pulled the handbrakes and his grandchild accidentally started the car again. In spite of all this, she survived without being fatally injured. The incident, that took place in China\u2019s Lianyungang city, can be viewed as an extreme case of bad luck. But the fact that she survived, in spite of what happened, is nothing short of a miracle. Driver rescues woman he runs over, only for her to be run over again since he forgot to pull the handbrake. Fortunately, she doesn\u2019t sustain any major injuries pic.twitter.com/mZmwX4rRC0. \u2014 CGTN (@CGTNOfficial) January 13, 2018.

VRepurposing shipping containers for human habitation is a bit of a hit-or-miss affair: sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped designers from trying. Natural mattress company Coco-mat of Greece (previously) teamed up with Greek shipping container architecture startup Cocoon Modules to create this fresh-looking prototype for an earthquake-resistant modular home that features smart, energy-efficient technology. As the Cocoon Modules design team explains:. Our modules are more than 15% cheaper than the prefabricated construction in Greece and 30% cheaper than the traditional [construction]. They can be built within weeks in designated industrial spaces and can then be transported and placed on site. By using the modularity of the container we create ergonomic spaces of great design that can be expanded as LEGOs do. The main living area features a long built-in couch, a table and a small kitchen and bathroom. The interior of the container home feels larger than most, thanks to the large glass patio doors, which can open up the space to the outside, therefore expanding it and eliminating that tunnel-like feel that other designs might fall prey to. The prototype has been furnished with Coco-mat's line of wooden furniture and linens. The bedroom is at one end, furnished with one of Coco-mat's comfortable mattresses, which use natural materials from renewable sources, such as coconut fibre, natural rubber, wool, cotton, sea grass, horsehair, silk, linen, wood and goose down. The roof has been waterproofed and a green roof put in. Having a green roof helps to better insulate and regulate interior temperatures, but it's not clear if having all that extra weight on the roof is a good idea, especially in this case with a shipping container -- though it's apparent from the construction time-lapse video that extra structural reinforcement was put in. Even if reusing shipping containers themselves can be problematic, the underlying idea of creating housing that's modular and easy to transport is nevertheless a relevant one that could potentially remake how we build and view our homes. No word on how much this particular prototype might cost, but you can find out more over at Cocoon Modules.

VA property allegedly belonging to the former first lady, Dame Patience Jonathan was on Tuesday demolished by the FCT Development Control Department. The building, which is inside A. Aruera \u2013 Reachout Foundation/Women For Change and Development Initiative, is situated on Shehu Yar\u2019Adua Way along Mabushi\u2013Kado\u2013Life Camp Expressway, Abuja. Mr Emmanuel Anene, a Lawyer with E.A. Ezugwu and Associates told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the issue of the building is still pending before the Federal High Courts in Lagos and Abuja. \u201cSometime before, people from Development Control came to the site, alleging that there was no approval for the building. \u201cWe met them at their office and showed them the approval, which they accepted. We thought that the matter was over. \u201cThey had earlier gone to court with application for forfeiture of the property to the government which they failed to achieve at the Lagos High Court. \u201cSo we were surprised that a team came in this afternoon without notifying us to remove the structure. \u201cAlso, we were not served with any notice for demolition, they just came in now and started the demolition of the structure,\u2019\u2019 he said. Responding, Mr Muktar Usman, Director of Development Control, Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), told NAN that the building has no approval and that notice was served for the demolition of the property. He said the building was not the only one affected by the demolition in the area as there were others that were also demolished. Muktar alleged that members of staff of the Development Control Department were also assaulted at the premises.

VExpansion push may come in 4 to 5 years, CEO says. Hiroto Saikawa, president and chief executive officer of Nissan Motor Co., speaks Tuesday in Detroit. DETROIT \u2014 Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s chief executive said the company believes it will need to build a new plant in the U.S. in four or five years, when the car maker would be ready for another push to expand. Normally, that plant would be built in any of the Nafta countries, \u201cbut in the current situation we are more inclined to invest in the U.S.,\u201d said Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, at the Detroit auto show. President Donald Trump has pressured Japanese auto makers to build factories in the U.S. Last year, Trump tweeted \u201cno way\u201d to Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s plants to import Corollas to the U.S. from an under-construction plant in Guanajuato, Mexico. Last week, Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. said they would build a $1.6 billion plant in Huntsville, Ala. Toyota\u2019s plant in Guanajuato will produce Tacoma pickup trucks, while the Alabama plant will focus on passenger cars. Nissan\u2019s plan comes as it eases off the U.S. market after years of rapid expansion. Sales have grown to around 1.5 million units, from one million units in 2011. That growth helped Nissan hit, and exceed, its target for U.S. market share, but it came at the expense of its profit goals.

VA Boeing 737-800 of Turkey\u2019s Pegasus Airlines is seen in Trabzon, Turkey, Monday, Jan. 15, 2018. A commercial airplane that skidded off a runway after landing in northern Turkey dangled precariously Sunday off a muddy cliff with its nose only a few feet from the Black Sea.Some of the 168 people on board the Boeing 737-800 described it as a \u201cmiracle\u201d that everyone was evacuated safely from the plane, which went off a runway at Trabzon Airport. (DHA-Depo Photos via AP). (Reuters) . A Pegasus Airlines flight skidded off the runway of a Turkish coastal airport and plunged down a steep slope on the edge of the Black Sea, ending up only metres from the water\u2019s edge\u2026. None of the 168 people on board was hurt in the incident, but passengers spoke of panic as the aircraft tipped nose first towards the sea. Just after the flight from Ankara landed at the Black Sea city of Trabzon there was a loud noise, Fatma Gordu was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency. \u201cWe tilted on the side and the front of the plane went down and the back of went up,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a huge panic, people were shouting.\u201d. When the plane came to a halt in thick mud, passengers smelt fuel. \u201cWe thought there would be fire,\u201d Gordu said. \u201cPeople panicked \u2013 there were pregnant women and children.\u201d. Video on social media showed fire crews pumping water over the plane on Saturday night. \u201cIt was a miracle,\u201d said another passenger, Yuksel Gordu. \u201cWe could have burned, we could have exploded or we could have gone into the sea.\u201d. Trabzon governor Yucel Yavuz said all passengers were safely taken off the plane and some had gone to hospital as a precaution. \u201cThey were all OK,\u201d he told Anadolu. Pegasus Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-800 aircraft \u201chad a runway excursion incident\u201d as it landed but the 162 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew were unhurt.

VThe newly-appointed Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Kehinde Bamigbetan was today greeted with a rousing welcome in the State Ministry following his appointment last week by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Speaking during the event, the outgoing Commissioner, Mr Steve Ayorinde said the government is a continuous process that abhors a vacuum, expressing happiness that he was handing over the baton of leadership of the Ministry to another professional with vast journalistic experience. Ayorinde noted that the Ministry is the face and voice of the Government and has remained in the forefront of positively projecting the image of the State Government, advising the new Commissioner to sustain the symbolic relations between the Ministry and other Ministries. The outgoing Commissioner expressed gratitude to all members of Staff and those of parastatal agencies for supporting the vision of the Governor as exemplified through their hard work and ingenuity. Responding, the new Commissioner, Mr Kehinde Bamigbtan commended Mr Ayorinde for raising the bar of excellence in information management, adding that Lagos became a unique brand locally and abroad, thereby justifying its position as a Centre of excellence. Bamigbetan described the change in leadership of the Ministry as one that is meant to provide the best for the people as the current administration is committed to excel in all sectors, explaining that the One Lagos initiative is to appeal to the need of the masses and take them to a higher level in 2019. He appealed to members of Staff not to renege in their effort at projecting image of the government, but rather be innovative and strategize on how best to further retain the confidence of the populace in Governor Ambode\u2019s administration as one that will take the State to a greater height. The new Commissioner stated that his focus would be on how to integrate community communication into the Ministry activities to encourage proper harmonisation between government policies and people at the grassroots. Earlier in her welcome address, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs Kofoworola Awobamise, pledged her support and that of the entire staff to the new Commissioner.

V Adrián Lamo .  former Office of Adrian Lamo (Sabbatical) at Adrián Lamo (2015-2016) . 141w ago. I always approached the companies I'd hacked, informed them of my findings, and offered to help fix them free of charge. Several (Excite@Home, Google (company), MCI WorldCom) thanked me, while others were more taciturn. It was ultimately The New York Times (with Microsoft (company) getting a piece of the action) that pressed charges. . My only precondition on disclosure was that the public would know what had transpired, through the media. This was an outgrowth of my time operating Inside-AOL, an AOL watchdog site that documented the foibles and security holes of that company at the height of its power. My finding were routinely ignored or suppressed (see: Can AOL silence its critics?); it was only when I incidentally discussed a critical security issue with a reporter and they contacted the company that any action was taken. This proved to be the rule and not the exception - companies still ignore user reports of insecurity, but not when they come through a reporter. . At the time, there was no law requiring companies to inform their customers if their info had been hacked, so this was one of the few windows into the prevalence of corporate hacking available at the time. . I've never argued that the altruistic nature of my hacks made them right or justified - I knew that what I was doing was illegal, and simply figured that as long as I was breaking the law, I might as well do it in the most polite way possible. I always said I would accept responsibility for my actions if it came to that, and when the time came, I pleaded guilty because I knew myself to be guilty. This, incidentally, is why I have little time for 'hacktivists' who bemoan the injustice of their fates when their fates come knocking on the door at 6am. We all own our actions, not just the aspects which we enjoy.

V Andrew de Andrade .  Silly Goose . 396w ago. The best way is by choosing good quality cotton, since wrinkling is a characteristic most common in cotton fabrics. If you choose cotton varieties with longer fibers, they tend to wrinkle less. The reason is that longer fibers tend to be thinner and therefore hold wrinkles less. Companies that produce cotton will typically remove a greater quantity of short fibers during the ginning process. Cotton varieties to look for are:. Pima cotton. Egyptian cotton. Sea Island cotton (I've heard this is the best, but I've never seen a garment made with sea island cotton before). Ref: http://www.extension.org/mediawi... .  Gloria Lin .  Product @Stripe. Formerly @Flipboard, Apple, Stanford EE . 396w ago. As always, the best measures are preventative. - Buy clothes that don't wrinkle. Go for button-downs from Brooks Brothers and workout / backpacking clothes from Under Armour. - Wear jeans. Jeans don't wrinkle, khakis do. - Wear skirts & dresses made of jersey and other slinky materials. - Fold your clothes immediately after they come out of the dryer. For traveling:. - Don't fold. Roll everything up. Not only does this guarantee fewer wrinkles, but you will also save mind-blowing amounts of space. To get out wrinkles at the last minute:. - Obviously, you can iron clothes made of cotton, wool-blend, etc. - For delicate fabrics like silk or organza, put the garment on a hanger and leave it in a steamy bathroom with the door closed right after you shower. It will steam out the wrinkles. .  Robert Withers . 286w ago. try a wrinkle releaser - spray it on - smooth the garment - wait five minutes - wear. Disclosure: I make this product. It's plant based too.

V Howard Liptzin .  Member of The Well in 1988, owning my own words online since then... . 370w ago. Facebook and Twitter are not sites per se, and the point is not just a technicality. They are services providing different tool sets and therefore tend to favor different behavior and use cases, so the assumption in "et al" is too broad, imo. You can ask the same question about fashion, art, literature and other human endeavors. Do people want to express themselves, make themselves known to others, be recognized and appreciated because they are narcissistic? It depends on the person, of course, but most of the time the answer is no, we're creative and social animals and our built-in circuitry wants to engage with others, the more the merrier. Twitter and Facebook in particular undoubtedly improve connectedness for many people and do so in meaningful ways that were simply not available before the advent of the internets and mass adoption. Are there people who use them only to gratify their egos or to feel more important? Yup, of course. Do some people use them as a substitute or proxy for real world socialization? Yes to that as well. It is not the fault of the tool, but of the person using it. Having said that, making it so easy for a vulnerable person to augment their narcissism is an unfortunate side effect of the freedom to choose, but there's not much to do about it other than unfollow, unfriend, etc. ;-).  Em Hall . 370w ago. I agree with most of Howard's assessment, but would argue that is *is* okay to lump social media sites together for certain purposes. Of course they do different things, but look how many people connect their FB account to their Twitter profile and vice versa. Or aggregate all of their activity into a single site like Posterous. I would argue that users like that are more toward the self-promotion/narcissism end of the spectrum, simply because they're often broadcasting and not using the sites to interact. And I'm with you on the unfollow/unfriend thing, Howard! Sometimes it take a little tough love to get users to realize they're using their powers for evil, and not good. :). Also, I have to share this great link on "How to make your Twitter profile look like a spam account," because it's just so apropos: http://www.uoh4u.com/vb/showthre...

VArusha in Tanzania may soon have banana shortages. BANANAS, the favourite food staple among many residents in the Northern Zone regions, may soon become scarce in Arusha, where large estates of such crops have been destroyed by cyclones, accompanying ongoing rains. The 'Mto-wa-Mbu' Division of Monduli District, where most of the banana consignments of Arusha come from, seems to have mostly suffered the agricultural loss, since all the local banana plantations, according to the farmers there, have fallen under the power of downpour mixed with windstorms. One of the farmers, Mr Mrisho Ramson, revealed here that the Majengo area of Mto-wa-Mbu suffered more losses. "And this is where all dessert and cooking bananas sent to Arusha, Singida, Manyara and Dodoma originate from," he said. He added that these precincts will face banana shortage in the first half of 2018. Majengo and Mgombani areas alone produce up to 1,000 bunches of bananas per day and the entire Mto-wa-Mbu area yields nearly 2,000 bunches per day but after the farm destructions, the areas produce just 70 bunches in a day. As the result, prices for bananas have hit record high, a single banana finger fetches 120/- instead of the usual 70/- at Mto wa Mbu. The price climbs once the bananas are taken elsewhere. Mwalimu Khamis Nyungu, is another resident of Mto-wa- Mbu. He explained that, in the past the area had trees' cover which used to block the winds. But now residents of the area have cut down the forests to expand their farms. "There is nothing to block the wind or reduce the force of water, therefore, whenever it rains, the area suffers floods and landslides, but when cyclones hit the precinct farms faced destruction," said Mr Nyungu. The Chairman of Majengo Village, Mr Raymond Muro said the incidences of banana plantations falling under pressure of storms are common things in the area and there is nothing they can do about it. He, however, admitted that the current catastrophe was the worst. He said banana plants take up to eight months before becoming productive and that the shortage of such staple will affect the Northern Zone regions until next August.

VIssa Rae Has Malibu Pool Party For Birthday. Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Marie Claire. Happy Birthday Issa! This Saturday Issa Rae hosted an epic Hollyweird gathering that pushed us to the limits of FOMO (only rivaled by her previous epic Lemon Pepper Function in Atlanta this Fall). The event lived mostly on Snapchat and Instagram stories so if you aren\u2019t following Issa, Amanda Seales, Lil Rel Howery and the like, you will probably never understand the greatness we\u2019re trying to communicate here. .  Thanks to all who came through! @devindanielle12 #MalibuShit. A post shared by  Issa Rae (@issarae) on Jan 14, 2018 at 10:21am PST. Issa offered just this tiny glimpse on her actual gram. But fortunately Issa has a Tiffany and Tiffany would never NOT let you know she was in attendance at such a function\u2026 Thanks Tiffany. Oops, we mean Amanda.  IssaBirfday! Had a full blast celebrating @issarae bday with fam coming together to get our entire black ass lives in Malibu (at the same house we shot Insecure Season 1:EP 8) electric sliding, eating potato salad, and of course singing Stevie Wonder \u201cHappy Birthday to Yaaaaa\u201d \U0001f388\U0001f381\U0001f389.

VA post shared by sofia's mummy UK (@sofiasmummyukrevoholic) on Jan 6, 2018 at 4:15pm PST.  Urban Decay's Naked Heat Palette ($54) was only just released last year, but can you remember a time without it? The bundle of 12 earthy neutrals quickly earned its place on vanities worldwide due to its range of hues that flattered all skin tones. . After the palette launched, there was something of a "Naked Heat" effect. Just in time for Fall, many other brands launched palettes full of similar colors like amber, orange, and sienna. And since those hues look so dang good on the eyes, who could be mad with more shades? One makeup enthusiast recently discovered a drugstore dupe that you might want to check out if you can't swing Naked Heat's $54 price tag. . In the photo posted above, you can see the Makeup Revolution Re-Loaded Palette in Iconic Fever ($7) juxtaposed against the Urban Decay option. This palette has 15 pans instead of UD's 12, and it contains a similar mix of matte and shimmer shades. While Naked Heat is full of mostly subdued colors, Re-Loaded is a bit more vibrant (get a load of that rose gold!). . Ulta sells other versions of Makeup Revolution's Iconic Palette, which all have an average review of four stars. One user wrote that the palette's colors are "beautiful" and "compare to expensive name brand eye color [palettes].". Another wrote, "I just adore how buttery this shadow is and the color payoff was incredible even compared to other high end products." You read that right: like buttah! And for less than $10 a pop, you might as well pick up two.

V Siddhartha Sarkar .  A frequent Air India flier and an aviation geek. . 111w ago.  Obviously Air India is better . So I'll point out the reasons for you :. 1. AI has a younger fleet and more advanced aircrafts like the 787 DL. 2. The aircraft maintainance services are better in India as the engineers are more skilled . 3. AI flies to more continents than PK. 4. The meal served in AI is far more better and considered one of the best airline meals. . 5. AI is a member of Star Alliance , the largest alliance in the world, so it provides connectivity to more than 270 destinations across the world . 6. The inflight entertainment system of AI is better as it provides a large no. Of choices to its passengers. .  Abdullah Khan .  Always wanted to be a commercial pilot. . 64w ago. I have traveled by Air India in 2006 when I was only 7 years old.I went to India.Air India was an okay airline because it had fine since it was having a great cabin whereas PIA that time was lost.So in my opinion Air India is better.  Aamir nur Ahmed .  Living in Birmingham . 92w ago.  Air India suspended flights to Pakistan many years ago due to lack of passengers. A pakistani going to India would fly by PIA and the people of India holidaying Pakistan would fly by PIA ...This gives a hint which airline is better. During 60's when numerous south Asians settled in Britain, this meant more flights to Pakistan and India however because airport's cancel contract with airline's that are not safe,old,dangerous,frequent complaints etc air india flights are hardly seen (depart,land) in Manchester airport ,landed Bradford airport and various airports in Europe. PIA aircrafts may not be good quality , entertainment may be poor but the air hostesses personally help you ,food is tasty.Air India air hostesses have an attitude, air India aircrafts may now be more modernised than PIA ones now but when you go inside it sticks of poo. Indian food is delecious anywhere but not when travelling air India. .  Manas Vibhute .  student . 69w ago. Of course Air India beacuse air india has good on time performance than PIA . Most of PIA flights are in delays. Air India has good services for good destinations .PIA should make good management and train their staff as best as possible .

V Hassaan Javaid .  MBBS from Medical School . 64w ago. Yes. HPV vaccine is available in India. And it is best to use this to vaccinate adolescent girls to prevent the development of the Human Papilloma Virus infection and ultimately Cervical Ca. Hope this answers your question.  Yasarapu Rajashekar .  B.TECH Elecrtonics and Communiction, Kakatiya University (2015) . 15w ago. The vaccines currently available are at a price bracket of Rs. 2,800 and Rs. 3,300per dose. Each woman would need three doses which would cost her Rs. 8,400 toRs. 9,900 depending on which brand of vaccine she chooses. The Rural Paradox. Poor hygiene and multiple partners are two of the many causes of cervical cancer. HPV vaccine is recommended for girls ages 9-13 years and three doses protect them against HPV infections that cause genital warts and cervical cancer. Recurrent HPV infection, which is transmitted sexually, is a cause for cervical cancer.  Esha Chainani . 64w ago. Yes it is. Please visit your primary care physician (GP) or Gynaecologist as soon as possible.

VFranck Ribery has opened up about the facial scars that gave him 'character' and 'strength' throughout his career in football. . The 34-year-old has spoken publicly about the trauma in years gone by and in an emotional interview with Canal+ Sport, the player has revealed how he dealt with the pain from childhood. . If you haven't heard the story before, Ribery suffered a serious head wound in a car accident at the age of two. He was rushed to hospital and required 100 stitches after crash in his hometown of Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. According to Yahoo, Ribery wasn't wearing a seat belt, which sent him crashing through the vehicle's windshield. . Ribery. Throughout his childhood people would stare and point at Ribery in the street, saying how 'ugly' the scars were, but as mentioned earlier the Frenchman turned it into a positive. . "People would say: 'Look what he has on his face, look at his head. What is this scar? It's so ugly.' Wherever I went, people would look at me." he told Canal+ Sport. "And not because I was a good person or because my name is Franck or was a good footballer, but because of the scar. Fastest players on FIFA revealed:. They gave me character and this strength. Because, when you are a child and you have a scar like this, it's not easy. The way people see you, the comments - my family suffered for this. The people who talk about you are the parents (of other children), and this is very cruel. I never went to a corner and cried, despite suffering.". Franck Ribéry: "Being a kid and having a scar like I do is not easy. People look at you, criticize... my family suffered that. But my scar was what gave me strength and character." pic.twitter.com/OZwnRVz8Q6. - Juan G. Arango (@JuanG_Arango) January 16, 2018 . Ribery also claimed in Simon Kuper's book The Football Men: Up Close with the Giants of the Modern Game, that the incident motivated him at a young age:. "The problem was that I was sitting in the back and I went flying forward on impact. In a certain way this accident helped me. As a child, it motivated me." Ribery said. . "God gave me this difference. The scars are part of me, and people will just have to take me the way I am.". You've got to applaud Ribery's attitude towards his scars. Brave. .

VHi, everyone. My name is Constanza Andrea Fuentes Ojeda; I\u2019m into surrealist-oneiric art (which contains a glum touch) since I was 16. It was a bit hard at first because I fell for art only by expressing myself and everything was fully connected to my feelings and to the internal pain I felt by that time, in fact, I didn\u2019t reveal my real name and I used to call myself LOS, because I didn\u2019t want anybody to realize that it was me. Today, I\u2019m 21 and I\u2019m able to say openly who I am: Coni Fuentes, the person who knew art as a way of channeling her internal conflicts. This project became a wonderful and indescribable passion because of everything that I\u2019ve experienced in my life and it opened the gates of my mind to depict in paper sheets those little pieces of emotions that affect me, which shape into unimaginable forms. Now, I want you to know my own world, because even though it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s full of infinite possibilities. You only need to hear it and observe it carefully because I honestly want you to know there\u2019s something else beyond what you\u2019re able to see: dreams, strange creatures, games or nightmares; deep concepts, magical places plus thousands of extravagant and disproportionate things you\u2019ll find in my art. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank anyone who takes time to read and know more about my universe, which for many people is imaginary but to me, it\u2019s real.

VA tiny Disney fountain sits in the backyard of the Turpin family home in Perris, CA (Picture: MailOnline). These grim photos show conditions inside the house where David and Louise Turpin tortured and starved their 13 children. The snaps, obtained by MailOnline, show a cheerful Mickey and Minnie Mouse fountain on a patio, with children\u2019s toys including a jumping frame visible through a grimy window. One snap shows two dog bowls sitting on a back porch \u2013 although the Turpins were not known to have pets. Careworn garden furniture including tables, chairs, diaper boxes and metal poles litter the Turpin\u2019s weed-strewn backyard. And neighbors claiming they had never seen any of the huge family venture outside. Soiled garden furniture and trash litters the back yard, with toy boxes visible inside the now-notorious property (Picture: MailOnline). (Picture: MailOnline). Shocked neighbors were unaware that David and Elizabeth Turpin had 13 children (Picture: MailOnline). Another photo shows rusting garden furniture (Picture: MailOnline). Leticia Gomez, 45, who lives directly behind the Turpin home was shocked to hear the family had children. She told MailOnline: \u2018I never even knew they had kids. \u2018I never heard or saw them at all. \u2018They don\u2019t take care of their garden at all \u2013 it\u2019s scruffy.\u2019. One neighbor claimed to have seen the youngsters scavenging in bins for food \u2013 but thought nothing of it. Another local also said she had seen the family\u2019s offspring, and \u2018joked\u2019 they were like characters from vampire book and film series Twilight, because they were \u2018really, really pale\u2019 and \u2018only came out at night\u2019. David and Louise Turpin were accused of torturing and starving their 13 children, with police even finding some of their offspring chained to furniture.

V Seba Blanco .  Young professional with extensive experience in all aspects of online marketing for hotels and hotel manage... . 178w ago.  Less discount the better. You can gain fidelity by being into small details (Check Adam Hamadache - How to WOW your guests - for more details ) If you offer discounts make sure you have a referral marketing strategy in place & a good Revenue Manager. Real interested clients are looking for your experience, not your discounts. In case you want to do discount I´ll recommend to sit down with your revenue manager and setup discounts into different OTA´s with the objective to get more "real" reviews into them . .  Mike Holovacs .  29 countries visited, 200+ flights, 200K miles flown, self-professed airline nerd. 2014 Master's, Hospitali... . 178w ago. They should get the discount they earn. . Here's the thing: there are so many promos and negotiated rates out there. You really have to fail to put forth some meager effort to never qualify for some kind of discount. Even the AAA card in your wallet is good for something...that something at my flag is 5% off the rack rate. It beats nothing, and when I tell people that the AAA rate is available, they shriek like children over $9.00. . What kills me as a Front Office person is when people get upset when I find out that they are misusing a discount. You're playing a game you shouldn't be playing and you got caught. That's my problem how, exactly? . Long story short, there is no such thing as an automatic discount. You get what you earn, and the hotel should not be bending over backwards to put heads in beds. That ends up being counterproductive in the long tem.  Aditya Sanghi .  Co-Founder and CEO, Hotelogix . 179w ago.  Any kind of discount is a good discount for the guest. If returning guests get separate discounts, it'll greatly help with the brand image building of the hotel (However, guests should be made aware that repeat guests enjoy special benefits) . Fans/followers of the hotel in social media can also get distinct discounts. This will help the hotel gain more fans/followers on social media and help spread its content far wider. .  Tom Hayward .  hotelier . 170w ago.  depends on if there is a promotion running , how busy the hotel or town/city it is located in is, or if the customer will become a regular guest, a one off client should really not expect discount unless there has been service issues. .

VWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Initial tests in Nevada on a compact nuclear power system designed to sustain a long-duration NASA human mission on the inhospitable surface of Mars have been successful and a full-power run is scheduled for March, officials said on Thursday. . National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Department of Energy officials, at a Las Vegas news conference, detailed the development of the nuclear fission system under NASA\u2019s Kilopower project. . Months-long testing began in November at the energy department\u2019s Nevada National Security Site, with an eye toward providing energy for future astronaut and robotic missions in space and on the surface of Mars, the moon or other solar system destinations. . A key hurdle for any long-term colony on the surface of a planet or moon, as opposed to NASA\u2019s six short lunar surface visits from 1969 to 1972, is possessing a power source strong enough to sustain a base but small and light enough to allow for transport through space. . \u201cMars is a very difficult environment for power systems, with less sunlight than Earth or the moon, very cold nighttime temperatures, very interesting dust storms that can last weeks and months that engulf the entire planet,\u201d said Steve Jurczyk, associate administrator of NASA\u2018s Space Technology Mission Directorate. . \u201cSo Kilopower\u2019s compact size and robustness allows us to deliver multiple units on a single lander to the surface that provides tens of kilowatts of power,\u201d Jurczyk added. . Testing on components of the system, dubbed KRUSTY, has been \u201cgreatly successful -- the models have predicted very well what has happened, and operations have gone smoothly,\u201d said Dave Poston, chief reactor designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. . Officials said a full-power test will be conducted near the middle or end of March, a bit later than originally planned. . NASA\u2019s prototype power system uses a uranium-235 reactor core roughly the size of a paper towel roll. . President Donald Trump in December signed a directive intended to pave the way for a return to the moon, with an eye toward an eventual Mars mission. . Lee Mason, NASA\u2019s principal technologist for power and energy storage, said Mars has been the project\u2019s main focus, noting that a human mission likely would require 40 to 50 kilowatts of power. . The technology could power habitats and life-support systems, enable astronauts to mine resources, recharge rovers and run processing equipment to transform resources such as ice on the planet into oxygen, water and fuel. It could also potentially augment electrically powered spacecraft propulsion systems on missions to the outer planets. . Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown.

VSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Passengers on a Malaysia Airlines plane flying from Sydney, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur which was forced to land in the central Australian city of Alice Springs said they were bracing themselves for a possible hard landing after the plane shook violently on Thursday. "We suddenly experienced a very violent shaking the aircraft and that probably lasted about five minutes and it was coming from one of the engines," passenger Hugh Wolton told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. "We got a call from the captain on the deck describing how to make plans for an emergency landing, you know, the wording used things like 'impact' so we were suddenly bracing ourselves for a rough landing.". Passenger Peter Brooks said the captain announced there would be "a couple of impacts" and some passengers thought the plane would come down in the desert. But about 45 minutes the captain said they would land in Alice Springs, he said. The airline said the Airbus A330-300 plane experienced a "technical fault" in one of its engines and the pilot decided to divert the flight. It said Flight MH122, which been flying close to the Western Australia state coast, landed safely in Alice Springs and "safety was not at any time compromised.". The airline said passengers would spend the night in Alice Springs and then be flown to Kuala Lumpur on Friday. Malaysia Airlines suffered two disasters in 2014. Flight MH370 vanished in March 2014 with 239 people on board and another flight carrying 298 people was shot down over Ukraine a few months later.

V Michael Chieco .  studied at Greenwich High School . 168w ago. A stat I've seen frequently is that ~70% of general aviation (small, privately owned and operated aircraft) crashes are attributable to pilot error. (http://www.pilotsofamerica.com/f...). General aviation tends to have a higher incidence of crashes than the professional airlines or military. General aviation flying is often done by less well trained pilots and in less regimented manner so I would expect the general aviation pilot error rate to be much higher than the airlines or the military. . All the above being said, Many aircraft crashes are a result of a chain of errors, not any specific technical or pilot specific error. The FAA / NTSB does a detailed report on all aircraft crashes in the United States. Often these reports list a series of decisions and incidents that led to the crash. These errors are attributable to both pilot error and technical problems. A good example of this was the crash of AA587 in 2001, which was a combination of an over control situation from the pilot (fully deflecting the rudder several times repeatedly) and an unknown technical defect in the airplane (the sensitivity of the rudder system). The NTSB report formally attributes this crash to pilot error but technical defects also contributed to the crash. . In short, The situation is often not cut and dry and many crashes involve both technical and pilot errors.  Bill Formby . 168w ago.  My answer, which is sheer speculation,, would be helicopters simply because there are more of them being flown and maintained by amateurs that than the other two categories. I am not meaning to demean any one but you will have more people who will have access to helicopters who may not always be as cautious as the professionals. I am sure that FAA records will have better stats than me. .

V Vishal Soni .  Consultant Laparoscopic & GI Surgeon at Zydus Hospital, Ahmedabad (2016-present) . 16w ago. I presume you mean a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Gallstone disease. In which case it should be a day or two. There is no need for bed rest per se. My patients start walking around in as less as 6 hours after the surgery and essentially are home the next day!. In case the surgery involves an open technique the pain of incision might make moving around abit difficult and couple of days rest should suffice.  Geren Nichols .  former Retired . 46w ago. It depends of course on the severity of the initial illness and any unusual events but for the routine laparoscopic gallbladder surgery zero bed rest would be recommended . Well, you\u2019re expected to have your usual sleep and you will be sore enough to to spend extra time sitting or lying down but spending a whole day abed will increase the risk of DVT. Standard recommendations are get up and walk about regularly. Many people are back to nonphysical work in 1 to 2 weeks.

VTHE first school term calendar which in the past has been 13 weeks, has this year been shortened to 11 weeks. Schools opened on January 9 and will close on March 28 yet in the past schools used to close during the first week of April. The shortening of the school term was necessitated by the Easter holidays that start on March 30 ending on April 2. The second school term will start on May 9 and ends on August 9 while the third term will begin on September 11 and ends on December 6, both terms having 13 weeks. Some parents fear that public examinations sitting classes would be affected by both the short first term and harmonised elections later in the year. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, permanent secretary, Dr Sylvia Utete Masango said learning would not be affected. \u201cWe have not yet really looked into that and we will advise but at the moment I had not checked when Easter is starting. The other issue is that elections dates are yet to be announced,\u201d said Dr Masango. Parents normally resort to extra lessons for examination sitting pupils but Government has maintained that it is illegal to offer extra lessons to pupils for a fee. Recently, Primary and Secondary Education Minister Professor Paul Mavima said paid extra lessons were creating problems in the civil service. He said Government will not allow teachers to be paid for extra lessons. \u201cExtra lessons are a problem because we cannot have a rational civil service with extra lessons. What if teachers then do not teach during the normal time waiting for parents to pay something in order to receive a service that you were supposed to receive from Government anyway?. \u2018\u2019So the issue of extra lessons had serious problems,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are not going back to a situation where teachers are paid for extra lessons but we are not saying no to extra lessons per se. What we are saying no to is the payment.\u201d. \u2013 Chronicle.

VDesigned by Seattle-based Tom Kundig of Olson Kundig Architects (whom we\u2019ve featured before for the practice\u2019s modern cabin), the Rolling Huts are a group of six architecturally designed platform homes nestled in the meadows of Washington state\u2019s Methow Valley. These huts are a modern alternative to traditional camping and offer guests the comforts of a hotel with the scenic views and quiet privacy of camping. The huts are essentially steel clad boxes that sit atop a wood and steel platform and hover above the landscape to give guests unobstructed views of the meadows and mountains. Guests can enjoy modern conveniences inside the 200 sq. ft. hut as well as the 240 sq. ft. deck space. Guests enter through double-paned sliding glass doors to interiors that have been lined with raw cork and plywood. The walls are topped with a perimeter of windows that allow natural light in while maintaining privacy from the other huts. An inverted, lopsided V-shaped panel roof protects each hut from the outdoor weather. Each hut comes equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave, fireplace, wifi, portable toilet, a sleeping platform for two and modular furniture that can be rearranged to accommodate more guests. For full bathrooms and showers, guests can visit the central barn located nearby. What: The Rolling Huts.  Where: 18381 HWY 20, Winthrop, Washington 98862, USA.  How much? Each hut is approximately $145 per night for two people.  Highlights: The Rolling Huts are a modern alternative to camping where guests have the modern conveniences of a B&B or hotel but full exposure to the vast openness of camping.  Design draw: Designed by Olson Kundig Architects, these huts have a design-forward aesthetic from the architecture to the minimalist interiors. Not camping and not quite glamping either, it\u2019s a pleasant middle ground alternative for modern travelers.  Book it: Visit The Rolling Huts website.

V Garrick Saito .  likes food . 140w ago. 2 ripe Hass avocados (In the restaurant, we use 48 per batch, multiple times per day). 2 tsp lime juice. 2 tbsp cilantro (chopped). ¼ cup red onion (finely chopped). ½ jalapeño, including seeds (finely chopped). ¼ tsp kosher salt. Pretty standard recipe for guacamole. Nothing special here.  Matthew Cuba .  I've been known to eat. . 155w ago. I had wondered about this for some time. I'm unsure of the origin of this recipe but I found this one some time ago on a website (maybe chipotlefan.com) and it is pretty close to the recipe at Chipotle. Chipotle Guacamole Recipe. Individual sized recipe:. 2 Hass Avocados. 1/2 of a Jalapeno pepper, seeded, and minced. 1/4 of a red onion, finely chopped. 2 heaping Tablespoons of Cilantro, finely chopped. 1/4 of a lime, juiced. 1/4 teaspoon salt. Combine all of the ingredients into a bowl, and mash together until smooth. Add additional lime juice or salt to taste. For extra spicy guacamole, you can leave in the jalepeno seeds!. Notes: This recipe is an approximation based on the original Chipotle recipe below. Please use it as a base for your guacamole creation, and feel free to make improvements based on your own personal preferences. Chipotle's Batch Recipe:. Remove stems and stickers from 48 avocados, wash for two minutes. Cut avocados in half, remove pit, scrape out the good stuff. Mash avocados in large mixing bowl. You don't have to get it to the final consistency yet, but it's easier if they're at least partially mashed at this point. Now for the other ingredients. Add 2-1/2 cups cilantro, 2-1/2 cups chopped red onions, 1/2 cup chopped jalapeno, 1/2 cup lemon-lime juice, and 3 tablespoons of salt. Continue mashing until smooth. When you go to store the guac, put a layer of plastic wrap directly on the guac and squeeze the air out, then put another layer of plastic over whatever container you're using. This keeps the guac from oxidizing and turning all brown. Depending on how long you keep it in the fridge, the top might turn brown anyway, so just skim off the top layer before serving. Personally I've never made the "batch" recipe, only the "individual" one but I really liked it. I added a bit more cilantro because I happen to really like it and I think I used bottled lime juice once when I didn't have any limes. It was OK with that too.

VNew Mormon president Russell Nelson insists the conservative church loves gay people (Picture: AP). The Mormon Church has appointed its new leader \u2013 a 93 year-old former surgeon who insists the faith loves gays. Russell M. Nelson tackled LGBT rights hours after being named 17th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, saying there were \u2018challenges with the commandments of God, challenges to be worthy.\u2019. He continued: \u2018God loves his children and we love them and there\u2019s a place for everyone. Regardless of his challenges.\u2019. One of his chosen counsellors, Dallin H. Oaks said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the love of the Lord and the law of the Lord.\u2019. Their response is unlikely to inspire hope of a more progressive stance on gay rights among the Mormon church. Nelson with his new senior counselors Dallin H. Oaks and Henry B. Eyring at his first press conference in Salt Lake City yesterday (Picture: AP). It has told its members to be \u2018welcoming\u2019 to LGBT people while also opposing same-sex marriage and gay relationships. The Church has also been blasted for not allowing women priests \u2013 and yesterday Nelson would only say that he and his faith \u2018need their voices\u2026and love their participation.\u2019. Its previous leader Thomas S Monson died on January 3 aged 90.

V Ritesh Kumar Singh .  Mid Level Corporate . 15w ago. your question is vague in itself, so let me try to answer it in more than one ways that I see possible\u2026\u2026. as they say beauty lies in the eyes of be holder\u2026\u2026. black is beautiful when you dressed in it on your wedding day. black is beautiful when you color your hair black from aged grey or white. black is beautiful when a beauty (black or wearing black) passes from proximity. etc etc etc. black is also the color of satan and hell. black is darkness and absence of light. black is also the color of sorry and grief. black signifies fear and remorse. so it depends how do you see it\u2026\u2026\u2026.i rest my case.  SyedaAlmas Fatima . 14w ago. Black colour is a classy colour which gets mixed up with any other colors and gives out a gud combination\u2026.. Some people believe black colour is unlucky something like that superstitious\u2026.but everything has their own beauty.. So in short black colour is really sexy and classy\u2026..

V Jones Schmit . 70w ago. Hi no doubt pets are very much loyal for their masters specially dogs. They love their masters a lot. Recently I came to know about The Vanderpump Dog Foundation which works for the right of pets. Their main aim is to stop tortures on pets and give them a healthy and happy world. I was really happy after knowing this. They have done really a great work and I am sure their pets also love them a lot.  Sagar Devani . 92w ago.  I dont think so tht people adopt pets in search of true love.I think people adopts pets for various reasons. list of reasons r:. 1.he or she is a animal lover. 2.he or she feels lonely so can express his feeling or thoughts to pets. 3.pets r faithful so people adopt pets. 4.he or she loves pets may be bcz they dont have a child.I may be wrong in this point.I think people likes pets for this various reasons.animals dont speak they listen to he or she so people like animals.people can treat animal according to their comfort. .

VOnePlus may have survived 2017 largely unscathed, but it has started the new year with a thunderous flop. Users everywhere have reported getting fraudulent credit card transactions after they used that same card to purchase something from OnePlus\u2019 online store. While OnePlus is still investigating the incident, it has temporarily stopped accepting credit card payments to put a halt to the reports. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to save those already affected. Using credit cards to pay online for goods and services is not only convenient, sometimes it\u2019s also the only way to pay for such things. Either way, it always carries a risk, though that risk is sometimes mitigated by the expectation that a more or less popular and large company would be more careful in handling such transactions. Sadly, OnePlus is popular but not large. Both for practicality and perhaps to be less liable for problems like this, it opted to go with a payment processing partner for credit card payments. OnePlus\u2019 brief explanation subtly points the finger in that direction, while, at the same time, explaining that it doesn\u2019t store any critical information, even in the \u201csave this card for future transactions\u201d feature. Unfortunately, the damage has been done and, to be fair, OnePlus doesn\u2019t have the capability to directly reverse the suspicious transactions. All it can do is to tell customers to report it to their banks and stop accepting credit card payments. That leaves only one payment option left: PayPal. Though the payment method does offer one added layer of protection/indirection, some buyers are unwilling to setup a PayPal account for whatever reason. In other words, it will ultimately lead to decreased sales. OnePlus says it is exploring other alternative payment options, though it remains to be seen if that will actually improve or worsen the situation. SOURCE: OnePlus.

V The pharmacy will start placing a "CVS Beauty Mark" this year on any beauty imagery that has not been retouched. . CVS Pharmacy will start telling shoppers this year when a beauty photo it has produced for stores, websites, social media, or any marketing materials has not been altered, the company said in a statement on Monday. Images that have not been altered, meaning a person's shape, size, proportion, skin or eye color, wrinkles, or any other individual characteristics have not been changed, will carry a "CVS Beauty Mark.". The watermark will be placed on all CVS Pharmacy-produced materials this year with the goal of all unaltered images in its beauty sections across its 9,600 stores carrying the mark by the end of 2020. "As a woman, mother, and president of a retail business whose customers predominantly are women, I realize we have a responsibility to think about the messages we send to the customers we reach each day," Helena Foulkes, CVS Pharmacy president, said in a statement. "As a purpose-led company, we strive to do our best to assure all of the messages we are sending to our customers reflect our purpose of helping people on their path to better health.". The CVS Beauty Mark, a circle with a heart shape at the center, comes as retouched photos come under stronger scrutiny. Getty Images, a stock photo agency based in Seattle, announced in September it would no longer accept photos of models that have been retouched "to make them look thinner or larger.". CVS Pharmacy's initiative launched as an effort "to lead positive change around transparency in beauty as well as to allow customers to differentiate between authentic and materially altered imagery," the company said. It has previously made headlines for ending the sale of tobacco products in its stores and committing to remove certain chemicals from its store-brand beauty and personal care items by 2019.

VWindjammers and a few other titles are sale this week. Sony has rolled out a new selection of game deals in the PlayStation Store. As was the case last week, this week's batch of deals is very slim, with only a handful of discounts available on PS4, PS3, and Vita, but players may still find something worth picking up on their console of choice. Once again, the bulk of this week's discounts are for PS4, many of which offer an additional percentage off for PS Plus subscribers. The Neo Geo classic Windjammers is $7.49. Additionally, Claire: Extended Cut is $4.49 ($6 without PS Plus), The Tenth Line is $8.70 ($9.74), Space Hulk is $21, Corridor Z is $2 ($4), Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon is $6, and Shred It is $5 ($7.49). PS4 owners can also still pick up the Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition Duke Nukem Bundle at a discounted $40.49 for a couple more weeks. Space Hulk is also discounted on PS3, running for $14 on the older console. Vita owners, meanwhile, can also pick up Windjammers, Claire: Extended Cut, and Corridor Z--all of which support Cross-Buy with PS4--for their aforementioned prices. You can find the full list of this week's discounts on the PlayStation Store. Most of the above deals will be available until January 23. In addition to that, January's free PS Plus games are also now available to download. This time, PS Plus subscribers can pick up Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Batman: The Telltale Series, Uncanny Valley, and Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness for no cost until the end of the month.

VOntario police arrested Gerardo Custodio Jr., a youth pastor, on suspicion of sexually abusing minors. Police are searching for more victims who they say may have been sexually abused by Gerardo Custodio Jr, a 30-year-old youth pastor in Ontario who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors.

VFile photo. President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Eleazar Chukwuemeka Anyaoku, on his 85th birthday. The President\u2019s greeting was conveyed in a statement issued on Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. President Buhari congratulated all the professional colleagues, family members and friends of the highly resourceful diplomat. He described him as an elder statesman whose resume on international diplomacy and community development continues to inspire and instruct on the power of discipline, focus and knowledge. \u201cAs the first and so far the only African Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the President affirms that Chief Anyaoku contributed seminally to Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999, combining his thorough understanding of the peculiarities of the political structures, with his office and international network of friends to garner support for the country\u2019s transition,\u201d the statement read. The President further commended Anyaoku\u2019s unwavering patriotism and commitment to the unity and progress of his country. According to him, the elder statesman has continued to contribute to national affairs, through formal and informal advice to presidents. President Buhari said one of such contributions was chairing the meeting that led to the adoption of the Abuja Accord, by which all the presidential candidates in 2015 committed themselves and their political parties to non-violent campaigns and acceptance of the results in good faith. He prayed that the Almighty God will grant Anyaoku, who is the Ichie Adazie of Obosi, longer life and more fruitful years to serve his country. The post appeared first on Channels Television.

V Devon Yang .  Ran track for many years . 384w ago.  It depends on what you consider running skill. Long distance running and running quickly are two different animals, especially if you are an amateur runner. A lot of this answer will depend on what distances you are currently running and what your overall goal of training is. When first starting out its typically better to train for longer distances. It will be much easier to go from running 1 mile to running 3 miles, in general, than from running a mile in 10 minutes to running a mile in 7. At some point, when you find yourself able to run 5 miles comfortably, it's probably a good time to try running a shorter distance at a faster pace and alternate distance/speed. .  Josh Smith .  Founder of Code Corps . 378w ago. Neither. And both. This sounds like a chicken shit answer, but it all depends. It depends on your targets, your abilities, your performance, your pain. There is no magic bullet. Your workouts need to be tailored to you. That said, once you determine what works best for you, increasing mileage past a certain point leads to overtraining. Instead, you will eventually find yourself running the same workouts repeatedly with an aim to decrease your times. This kind of self-competition is crucial. I highly recommend reading Run Faster by Brad Hudson, as well as Run by Matt Fitzgerald. The former teaches you how to self-coach and adapt your workouts to your needs, while the latter gives a grand overview of the latest and greatest in exercise science.  Clara John . 247w ago.  The best thing is to analyse your skills whether your are good in running fast or good in reaching more distance. Both the task need different skills. After properly analyse your worth, work on that skill which you lack. It will automatically becomes useful for the other skill. .  Justin Hamade .  python, linux, java, js and bio hacker . 364w ago. I have been doing some research on running and what I am doing to improve my running is focus first on form and then on cadence. I run about the same distance each time and try to do it faster, but I am training for sprinting as well as for distance.

V Paul Dezso deHolczer .  lived in London . 159w ago.  Before you go, you should get in contact with the. Sherlock Holmes Society of London.  (Page on sherlock-holmes.org.uk). You may want to join and then schedule ("shed-yool") your visit around some of their annual events. You should ask to meet up for a pint with fellow admirers. You will likely enjoy warm cameraderie and get some great insights which are not available to the solitary or casual visitor. You can book a Sherlock Holmes Tour (Sherlock Holmes Tours in London) and a London Walk focusing on Sherlock Holmes (IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). You can do some touring on your own (Sherlock Holmes London Itinerary). You will probably want to buy a guide book and take it with you (Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and Devon: A Complete Tour Guide & Companion: Brian W. Pugh, Paul R. Spiring, Sadru Bhanji: 9781904312864: Amazon.com: Books). You will certainly want to visit The Sherlock Holmes Museum . 221b Baker Street London NW1 6XE England (Page on sherlock-holmes.co.uk) and . The Sherlock Holmes [Pub] 10-11 Northumberland Street, Westminster, WC2N 5DB (Page on sherlockholmespub.com). . You may wish to tour the Inns of Court (#4 on this list London: 10 Things to Do). . You might want to read up on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and visit places of import to him and his works and mentioned in his works. You can visit his home at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, now marked by a memorial plaque. You can also visit his former residence on Tennison Road in South Norwood. Arthur Conan Doyle lived on Tennison Road in South Norwood, from 1891 to 1894, but, contrary to popular belief, did not use the area as the setting for the Sherlock Holmes story The Adventure of the Norwood Builder. This story, for the most part, takes place in Lower Norwood (today known as West Norwood). The only connection between this story and South Norwood is that South Norwood's railway station, Norwood Junction, is used by the villain.[6] The NatWest Bank on South Norwood High Street was, in Victorian times and until the mid-1980s, the local police station and is the most likely candidate for the police station mentioned in the second Sherlock Holmes story The Sign of the Four.[6]. (South Norwood). Enjoy your trip!.

V Dimitris Smith .  Flown on 15 airlines many, many times, esp. Star Alliance . 64w ago. Part of this answer is taken from one of my other answers about Lufthansa. I fly with the Lufthansa Group pretty often (mostly SWISS, but Lufthansa and Austrian as well). Their customer service team can be arrogant, and yeah, some Asian carriers might outclass them in certain categories. But their core product, considering they\u2019re the biggest airline group in Europe, is damn impressive. They\u2019re efficient, don\u2019t treat economy class passengers like cattle, and their airport infrastructure includes some of the best airports in Europe and sometimes in the world (Munich, Zurich, Frankfurt, Vienna). They have codeshares with many different airlines, and their transatlantic product is also one of the best in the industry. Their Business Class and First Class products are also innovative and class-leading, at least on long-haul flights. So as long as I continue flying to Europe, I\u2019ll continue using the Lufthansa Group over any U.S. carrier. I flew from Munich to JFK in August, and my experience was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had in a plane. I was in an Airbus A340\u2013600, which is an older plane, but Lufthansa had recently refitted the cabin to extend its life. Munich Airport was a pleasure to travel through. On board, the seat screens were very big and the entertainment system worked flawlessly, the flight attendants were extremely professional and friendly, the bathrooms were some of the largest I\u2019ve ever seen in an aircraft, the pilot consistently updated the passengers as to every single little detail about the flight. Even when they messed up by not bringing us the vegetarian meals we had ordered, they compensated us by making us a meal from the Business Class choices. They go above and beyond to make the customer happy, and in the end, that\u2019s all that matters. They even managed to locate a camera I accidentally forgot on board and ship it back to me. At JFK, which is almost unheard of.

VA post shared by Amena (@amenaofficial) on Jan 14, 2018 at 3:04am PST.  In a new ad for L'Oréal Paris Elvive Nutri-Gloss, British beauty blogger Amena Khan says, "Whether or not your hair is on display doesn't affect how much you care about it." As a hijab-wearing makeup artist, Amena has made a living doling out beauty advice to women who cover their heads for religious reasons. And now, she's making history with L'Oréal Paris UK as the first hijab-wearing woman to front a hair campaign. . L'Oréal Paris tapped Amena and other UK personalities to rep Elvive, a line that helps refresh damaged hair. (You may recall that Winona Ryder is the US spokeswoman for Elvive and just dropped a gorgeous ad for the products herself.) As Amena told Vogue UK, it's a big effing deal for a brand to cast her in this latest series. . As she told the site, "For me, my hair is an extension of my femininity. I love styling my hair, I love putting products in it, and I love it to smell nice. It's an expression of who I am.". A post shared by Amena (@amenaofficial) on Dec 24, 2017 at 1:36pm PST.  Amena has worn a hijab in public since her early 20s but pointed out that she uncovers her hair when she's at home or with her family. "You have to wonder \u2014 why is it presumed that women [who] don't show their hair don't look after it?" she asked Vogue UK. "The opposite of that would be that everyone that does show their hair only looks after it for the sake of showing it to others. And that mindset strips us of our autonomy and our sense of independence. Hair is a big part of self-care.". What's more, Amena hopes that L'Oréal Paris's inclusion of a hijab-wearing model in its campaign will inspire young women who also prefer to cover their heads. Growing up, Amena said, she could never relate to the Eurocentric casting in mainstream media. "I think seeing a campaign like this would have given me more of a sense of belonging," she said. . Congratulations, Amena! (And if you're reading this, please let us know what that gorgeous fuchsia lipstick you're wearing in the ad is.).

VMADRID (Reuters) - The Catalan parliament will meet on Wednesday in a first step towards forming a local government after December\u2019s elections but questions remain over whether the wealthy northeastern region will continue to push for a split from Spain. . The election, called by Madrid to derail the independence movement, failed to resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades after secessionist parties won a majority of seats, although the failed to get more than half the popular vote. . Uncertainty surrounding the future of the region has led to thousands of companies, including two of the country\u2019s top banks, moving their headquarters from Catalonia to elsewhere in Spain and has ramped up tension between Madrid and Barcelona. . Key to developments over the next few weeks will be whether sacked former leader Carles Puigdemont, in self-imposed exile in Brussels where he is avoiding charges of rebellion and sedition back in Spain, is allowed to present himself for re-election. . Puigdemont and his cabinet were fired by Madrid after his administration declared independence from Spain in October on the basis of the results of a banned referendum on secession. . On Wednesday, lawmakers will elect the parliamentary committee which will have the ultimate decision on whether Puigdemont will be allowed to participate in parliamentary activity from Brussels. . Late on Tuesday, the two main pro-independence parties said they would back Puigdemont as presidential candidate. . However, the Catalan parliament\u2019s legal experts have ruled that Puigdemont, if elected, cannot be sworn in as regional head without being physically present in the chamber. . Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has rejected as absurd any suggestion of Puigdemont leading the region from Brussels and said, if he were chosen, Madrid would maintain direct rule it imposed following Puigdemont\u2019s declaration of independence. . The secession movement has been weakened by the fact that five members of parliament, including Puigdemont, are in self-imposed exile in Brussels while three are serving custodial sentences in Madrid for charges linked to the banned referendum. . However, even if these eight lawmakers are not able to vote, the pro-independence parties will still have more weight in parliament than those favouring unity with Spain. .

V Lisa Malone .  Make all my own face masks, tried and tested a lot of products . 94w ago. Hi . Thank you for your A2A. . Using face talc is not unmanly at all but would be an inconvenience. Women can carry around translucent pressed powder to blot away oils. I doubt very much it is acceptable in today's society for men to do this but this is just my opinion. Maybe you should invest in a pack of blotting paper from your drugs store,which is just as affective at absorbing oils and doesn't cost much either. I carry around blotting paper for convenience because I seem to always break my powder compacts.  Mary Alexander-Brum .  I Love Homemade Skincare . 93w ago. Not recommended! Talcum Powder made from talc is a natural mineral made up of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen but contains in its natural form asbestos which is now illegal to use in construction in the USA since the 1970s. See this article: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/can... I recommend using corn starch which is the main ingredient in baby powder and used in many cosmetics products as it has a very similar smooth texture like talc. Corn starch is something I use to bake and cook with so if you have some at home, separate some into a small container with a lid and use that by dipping a small make up brush and applying lightly. You could use blotting sheets for shine control as well. Here is an actual product that is found in stores and online: Neutrogena Shine Control Powder. It contains a Rice Protein Complex.  Raet Maggi . 94w ago. My personal opinion is that using talcum powder is probably most useful for those who have oily skin or live in hot, humid environments. Using talcum powder after shaving is a long established tradition. It is applied to the face and neck to calm the skin, absorb residual moisture and oil, and in some cases to reduce the look of dark stubble over light skin.  Yuen Ho Chow .  Medical Director at The Clifford Clinic . 27w ago.

V Jonathan Greenstein .  Watching the NFL in London . 39w ago. I absolutely love having the games come over. The UK has 3 leagues here and I play for a second divisimoney American football team in London. Having the NFL come over every year helps elevate the sport and build more interest in it. I even wrote an article about my experience playing American Football. Let me know what you think. https://www.sp-bx.com/4-things-y...  Darren Johnson .  Played 9 years of football. . 57w ago. No answers yet, but I can say when I watch the London games on TV, the audience seems a bit off. For example, they seem to overly cheer the kicking of an extra point. Even when the kick used to be from the three yard line. Americans know that's no big deal. I wonder if they find the live game otherwise boring, as the NFL live can have long pauses as players are standing around the field during commercial breaks. Also, when they show the stands, it's mostly middle aged men at the game whereas the American games have a lot of women and kids in the stands. It seems like the NFL there is a niche for a very specific audience, and doesn't have much universal appeal.

VSixteen persons have been feared dead in a ghastly motor accident along dilapidated Minna-Bida road, bringing to three of such motor accidents that have occurred on the road in the past three months. LEADERSHIP gathered yesterday that the accident occurred at Kakapangi after Katearegi town in the Katcha local government area of the state about 30 kilometres to Bida. It was learnt that the accident involved a Toyota Hiace bus conveying traders from Oyo State to Minna and a Tanker loaded with fuel enroute Bida town and it occurred when the bus tried to doge a pothole on the road. An eye witness account revealed that when the two vehicles collided they both went in flame because of the inflammable nature of the content of the tanker. The eye witness account further revealed that the driver of the commercial bus and his 15 passengers were trapped leading to their bodies roasted to death. Whereas it was not clear whether the occupants of the fuel tanker escaped, it was learnt that the tanker was burnt down as sympathisers at the scene battled spiritedly to recover the remains of those that were burnt in the commercial vehicle. The public relations officer of the Federal Road Safety Corp, Niger State command, Malam Raji Ejigogo, confirmed the story but added that the organisation was yet to get details of the incident. He said, "We cannot say the number of casualty, our emergency accident team has gone to the area for on the spot investigation.". Some of the sympathisers blamed the frequent accident and the resultant heavy casualty to the bad nature of the road that raise dusts which make it difficult for motorists along the road to see their vision easily . I tried this ancient herb to improve my sex-life and it actually worked, it is an upgrade for me and madam's happiness.

VA glitch is making Facebook a lot more minimalist. Facebook's News Feed is broken. No, that is't a comment on the current state of social media or Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to fix what's broken about Facebook. . I mean, it's literally broken. Many users are reporting that they're opening the Facebook app and website only to see a big, blank space that says "there are no more posts to show right now.". Though not affecting all users, the glitch appears to be fairly widespread, with a number of users reporting some variation of the "no posts" issue. Facebook is broken right now. pic.twitter.com/VHMpX3IJmL. \u2014 Meredith Guthrie (@meredithea) January 16, 2018. Hey @facebook what's going on with the news feed? It does not show anything saying "There are no more posts to show right now.". \u2014 \u042e\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (@JulieBondarenko) January 16, 2018. It's not clear what the cause is, or if it's related to Facebook's recent changes to its News Feed algorithm. We've reached out to Facebook for more information and will update if we hear back. While the apparent glitch may be an annoyance for some Facebook addicts, others are pointing out that it's actually kind of nice to have some News Feed silence for a change. . I'm honestly loving the new Facebook algorithm pic.twitter.com/UNcjOemJWt. \u2014 eve peyser (@evepeyser) January 16, 2018. I think Facebook is either borked or has suddenly realized how antisocial i am pic.twitter.com/Fj6X7Qv0ra. \u2014 Arlen Parsa (@arlenparsa) January 16, 2018. Facebook is showing me one "memory," two ads, and "there are no more posts to show right now." Yeah, it's time to leave. \u2014 Marianne Stebbins (@mstebbins) January 16, 2018. Ironically for Facebook, the blank News Feed comes just days after the company unveiled plans for a massive overhaul of the feature. The company's plan is to refocus users' feeds around posts from friends and family members, not posts from brands, businesses, and publishers, even if it comes at the expense of people spending less time on Facebook. So while News Feed's current issue likely isn't exactly what Facebook had in mind, it's certainly one way to accomplish that goal. . Now stop obsessively refreshing your News Feed and reclaim all that wasted time.

V Jon Mixon .  Contact me through Facebook. Thanks. . 231w ago. Some thoughts:. The time it takes to make a burrito or a bowl may preclude it from being rest stop/truck stop restaurant. Cost - Chipotle costs more than many similar restaurants and that increased price may be a "turn off" for some. Drive through - Same reason as # 1: Time. If people had to wait the length of time it takes to make a Chipotle burrito bowl, many would not go more than once. The drive thru wouldn't pay for itself and the restaurant would have to close it. Also, there's a certain "cachet" that Chipotle maintains and a having a "driv thru" might ruin that.  Matt Wasserman .  Top Writer 2014, 2015, 2017 . 231w ago. Rest stop contracts are won through a bidding process. The bids are based on the expectation of incredibly high volume and higher prices than you get at other locations. It costs a lot to win. Maybe Chipotle feels it isn't possible to support the volume needed to make such a contract profitable. . They don't have a drive through because it doesn't fit their production model or their business model. Part of the "Chipotle experience" is having someone look you in the eye, smile, and help you make your lunch. Regular customers develop relationships with the servers. You don't get that at a drive through. . Plus they would need a second line to support a second point of purchase - there's no way to insert a second stream of orders into what they have now. That second line would have to pay for the additional square footage, equipment, and staff it requires. . Drive throughs are better suited to restaurants where final assembly is divided by product instead of by customer.

V Andrew Grimm . 97w ago. Here's the really obvious answer. Other humans. Up until the relatively peaceful last half of the 20th century in which the alternative was total annihilation, mankind has been observed placing one tribe, religion or race as a governor and authority to the detriment of any or all of the other groups. . And this has never been as simple as it sounds. Often it took short term alliances with known tribes, hated tribes or capable tribes to reinforce this sentiment. What did it mean for the Alpha tribe?. It meant a better choice of wealth which made available better options in living conditions mating partners and food supply. So the most intelligently positioned tribe managed to scoop these longer-term genetic gains. And when they got lax in their administration another tribe would rise from obscurity. . Who was either more strong, more intelligent or formed better alliance relationships to dominate. So the best placed animal to change the human intelligence grid has been the one animal he detested and feared the most of all. Other similar humans.

V Andrew Bransford Brown .  Monetary theorist, trader, ex-software developer . 147w ago. To gather beautiful females into distinct geographical areas with predictable social interactions. This allows a predatory underclass of males to access the upper class of females. By offering a single prize that does not cost all that much, as compared to paying them directly, hundreds of women will reorganize their entire lives towards the goal of winning. They will groom and practice and improve themselves for a cost of nearly nothing. Aside from the predictable dance and singing and exercise areas (used to cull dates or provide familiarity), the geographic concentration of beautiful women for the event is extraordinarily high. Not only are the contestants in the area, but their friends, sisters, and mothers are there as well. Since a pageant can only have 1 winner, the rest of the contestants are heartbroken over the time spent and their hope is decimated. This makes it easier to console the losers with the intention of sex. This might require drugs or alcohol, but killing hope is usually sufficient to get a beautiful, intelligent, educated female to lower her standards by a large margin.  There was this one article I came across a blog called SEA OF BEAUTIES\u2026!!! . It talked about all the social works that is being carried out by all pageants. Pageants are also a mean of gathering funds for charity which might not have been done if beauty was not involved. Read the article: Beauty Pageants: Beyond the BEAUTY..!!!! .

V John Brew .  Neuroscience student . 137w ago.  An issue that both current and future implants face is biocompatibility. There is a good discussion of issues related to invasive brain-machine interfaces in Building Brain-Machine Interfaces to Restore Neurological Functions (a chapter by Mikhail A. Lebedev, Roy E. Crist, and Miguel A. L. Nicolelis in the book Methods for Neural Ensemble Recording). One issue that is discussed is the encapsulation of electrodes by fibrous tissue, which is in response to inflammation. There are a number of references cited in this chapter that may be worth pursuing. .  David Higgins .  Molecular Biochemist, Science Teacher . 137w ago.  Conceivably, there are a few people with massive disability that have implants to control stuff. There was a lady on a documentary I watched recently who was the first person to have a robotic arm and hand lift a cup of coffee to her mouth with her mind. The technology is pretty young but huge numbers of receivers "neural dust" as you put it might one day be a thing. Its an interesting idea for sure, and the advances in micro/nano fabrication techniques of electronics that are underway at present are likely to make it possible. Once its possible it tends to be done... even if its a bad idea. It may even be a key way in which we will get our understanding of the brain beyond its current rudimentary phase. .

VThe Model 3 To-Do list just got even longer. One thing that's clear as touchscreen and digital interfaces take over automobile dashboards: All these screens add complexity and dangerous distraction to the driving experience. Now Elon Musk has announced that Tesla owners "will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command" in the Model 3 thanks to a future software update. Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.  \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2018 . Musk made the promise on Twitter, where he's been particularly active lately in responding to Tesla owners who ask about future software updates or reports of glitches. He was responding to a user who said "nearly everything you control on the Model 3 requires input on the screen. Thus, taking your eyes off of the road more than most other cars.". Artificial intelligence is quickly seeping into the automobile. Companies ranging from Hyundai, through its Blue Link remote service, and Toyota, Lexus and BMW through Amazon Alexa, are expanding voice-control integration in the cockpit. Musk in the same response noted that software developers are currently focused on "core Model 3 functionality," and Tesla has many issues on its hands right now with the Model 3, from lagging production estimates to complaints from new owners about subpar interior materials. It's also not clear whether the voice-control capability would be extended to the Models S and X. In recent weeks Musk has used Twitter to promise "major browser upgrades," improved navigation software and even an electric pickup truck. Musk makes a lot of pronouncements on Twitter that probably induce heartburn among Tesla staff. But there's little doubt that his responsiveness to customers, and occasional solicitations of ideas, go a long way to cultivate brand loyalty among owners. It's remarkable to watch, and no doubt other automakers are taking note.

VYenagoa \u2014 Ijaw Youths from the Nine States of the Niger Delta region has threatened to drag the Federal Government and the Nigerian Military to Court over the invasion and setting ablaze of houses at Toru-Ndoro Community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State during the security search for the deceased militant known as Karowei for beheading a security operative and killing of Four soldiers. The Ijaw Youths under the umbrella of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) worldwide led by the President, Comrade Eric Omare called on the Federal Government and the Nigerian Military to commence the rebuilding of the destroyed community or face a Court action from the Ijaw youths and communities. The IYC President,Comrade Eric Omare,who made this known at the weekend during a meeting with some Youth leaders of Toru-Ndoro Community in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, stated that if the federal government fails to take steps towards the rebuilding of Toru-Ndoro community and compensate those who suffered losses as a result of the invasion within two weeks, the IYC would mobilize Ijaw and human right lawyers all over Nigeria to sue the federal government and the Nigerian military to court for the unlawful damage to properties and other damages suffered. The Ijaw Youth Leaders further stated that it is illegal and unconstitutional for a community to be burnt down in the name of searching for a suspected criminal. There is no law in Nigeria which empowers security agencies to attack and burn down the entire community because of the alleged offences of a few members of the community. The IYC leader recalled the several cases of invasion of Ijaw communities by military authorities including Okerenkoko, Ayakoromo, Ajapa, Odi, Ajakuruama and now Toru-Ndoro. Omare vowed to pursue this case to its logical conclusion including international human right platforms so as to put a stop to the persistent and naked violations of human rights in Ijaw and Niger Delta communities.

V Francis DiMenno . 210w ago.  Anonymous .    · Upvoted by  , A.B. English Literature and Language & Ethnomusicology, Harvard College (1979) . This IvyGate article pretty much sums up their reputations/stereotypes, even though it is a little outdated: The IvyGate Guide to Punch Season, Part II: Meet the Players. What my friends and I think of when we think of each club (which align with the article nicely):. The PC - Rich. These guys wear tuxes a lot. They like to appear mysterious and exclusive. They aren't subtle with their wealth and elitism. . The Owl - The biggest and bro-iest membership. Known for their pretty open parties (to girls at least) with a lot of vodka to go around. They will reliably be partying every weekend. There will be a shirtless bro in every room. They like Taylor Swift. The Fly - Rich and preppy. Known for the loud pop music they blast out of their house. The dance floor is often mostly empty, but there are usually a lot of people mingling the the first upstairs room. The Spee - Lots of internationals, particularly Brits. Usually quite cool. Laid back most of the time but know how to party (e.g. at Eurotrash, at Chinese New Year). The Phoenix - Hard to pin down. Lots of different sports, background and extracurricular represented. The AD - Ragey and fun, but kind of douchey (their grad board shut them down last year due to some pretty un-classy events). Lots of LAX and tennis bros. The Delphic - Bro-y but friendly, probably the most open/likely to let non-member guys into parties. Basement has skeezy reputation which is potentially undeserved. The Fox - The most artsy/alternative club in that they seem to punch from various organizations. Lots of nice guys.

VGlowing red lava rolled down the slopes of a Philippine volcano Tuesday morning as authorities maintained a warning of a possible hazardous eruption.  The lava was quietly flowing in some places but at times Mount Mayon was erupting like a fountain, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. Lava had advanced up to 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the crater, and ash reached up to 2 kilometers and fell on nearby communities.  Nearly 15,000 people have fled the danger zone within 6 to 7 kilometers of Mayon, and the institute strongly advised people not to re-enter the area.  Several small pyroclastic flows were generated by fragments in the lava streams and not by an explosion from the crater vent, like occurred with Mount Pinatubo, said Renato Solidum, who heads the volcano institute. Pyroclastic flows are superheated gas and volcanic debris that can race down slopes and incinerate everything in their path, and are feared in a major eruption.  "The pyroclastic flows, there were several, were not generated by an explosion from the crater with lava, molten rocks and steam, shooting up the volcano then rolling down," Solidum said. "These were generated by lava fragments breaking off from the lava flow in the upper slopes.".  He also said Mayon has not seen enough volcanic earthquakes of the type that would prompt scientists to raise the alert level to four, which would indicate an explosive eruption may be imminent. Emergency response officials previously said they may have to undertake forced evacuations if the alert is raised to four.  After steam explosions Saturday and lava rising in the crater on Sunday, the alert was raised to three on a scale of five, indicating a hazardous eruption is possible "within weeks or even days.".  Mayon lies in coconut-growing Albay province about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Manila. With its near-perfect cone, Mayon is popular with climbers and tourists but has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently.  In 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings. Mayon's first recorded eruption was in 1616 and the most destructive in 1814 killed 1,200 people and buried the town of Cagsawa in volcanic mud.  The Philippines lies in the so-called "Ring of Fire," a line of seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.  In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing about 800 people.

VPope Francis has said he feels \u201cpain and shame\u201d over a sex abuse scandal which has rocked the Catholic Church in Chile. The Pope also asked the victims of sexual abuse committed by priests for forgiveness. He made the remarks during his first official address in Chile. The Pope had been criticised in Chile for his decision to ordain a bishop who is accused of covering up sexual abuse committed by a priest. Pope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church\u2019s credibility, and that \u201csanctions\u201d must be imposed against perpetrators. But critics in Chile say he failed to respond to their request to review the appointment of Juan Barros as bishop of Osorno. Parishioners in the southern Chilean city say Bishop Barros used his position in the Catholic Church to try to block an investigation into the actions of his mentor, Catholic priest Fernando Karadima. The case of Fr Karadima, an influential priest who was found guilty by the Vatican of sexually abusing young boys and ordered to do penance, shook the Catholic Church in Chile. Pope Francis said on Tuesday that he was sorry for the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d caused to the victims of sexual abuse by Church ministers. On Monday, activists fighting for the rights of sexual abuse victims gathered in Santiago for a conference. They launched an organisation called Ending Clerical Abuse which \u201cseeks to stop child sexual abuse by the clergy\u201d worldwide. Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, one of the activists, Juan Carlos Cruz, told the BBC that \u201cthe time for saying sorry and forgiving is over\u201d. \u201c[Saying sorry] is not sufficient for a survivor. What we want is for the Pope to take action.\u201d. \u201cThere are concrete things that he can do, like removing priests who have been accused and sentenced by the Chilean justice system or canon law and bishops who have covered up [sexual abuse],\u201d he says. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke has said Pope Francis might meet victims of sexual abuse in private, as he has on past trips, but there has been no official confirmation of such a meeting. Under Pope Francis, a Vatican committee has been set up to fight sexual abuse and help victims but Chilean victims of clerical sex abuse say more transparency is needed.

VTropical Cyclone Berguitta is intensifying in the southern Indian Ocean and is likely to have a major impact on the \u2018island paradises\u2019 of both Mauritius and Reunion. There remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding the track of Berguitta. It is currently over open water, but forecasts suggest it will track very slowly towards the southwest, striking Mauritius around 00:00GMT on Thursday. At 09:00 GMT on Monday, Berguitta was the equivalent of a Category 1 storm on the five-point Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 140km per hour (km/h). Wave heights of more than seven metres were also observed. As Berguitta continues to feed off the warm waters of Indian Ocean, it will intensify into the equivalent of a Category 3 system, with sustained winds of 185km/h. By the time the cyclone strikes Mauritius, it may have weakened marginally, but the winds will still be strong enough to cause \u201cextreme damage\u201d. Mauritius can expect a direct hit from a cyclone roughly once every five years. The last Category 3 equivalent storm to hit the island was Cyclone Hollande in February 1994 which killed two people, destroyed 450 homes, and caused $135m in damage. Numerous rainfall records. Although winds from these cyclones attract news headlines, it is often the storm surges, flooding and mudslides which result in the greatest loss of life. Fortunately, Mauritius is the first small island developing state in the Indian Ocean to have its own tide and storm surge early warning system. This may well prove necessary because the island has one of the highest population densities of any country on Earth, and cyclones in this region can produce vast amounts of rainfall. The island of Reunion, 220km to the southwest, holds numerous rainfall records from systems similar to Berguitta. For example, Cyclone Denise struck the island on January 7 to 8 of 1966. The site of Foc-Foc recorded 1,825mm in 24 hours \u2013 a record that still stands. That was no fluke, either. The island holds two 48 hour rainfall records: 2,467mm in March 1952, and 3,000mm in February 1993. Rainfall could again be the major weapon in Berguitta\u2019s arsenal, as it is moving at barely walking pace, allowing it to drop much more rain than a faster moving system.

V Swan Yee TL .  lived in Myanmar . 77w ago. Hey there! Thanks for the A2A. The route itself seems pretty fine...though I will admit I'm not too well versed on that. If you're taking a plane (for Yangon to Mandalay for instance) the duration wouldn't be much of a problem either. The only suggestion I have right now is that perhaps 8 days at the beach is a bit long. There's not much to do at the beaches here, and the resorts and hotels aren't really the type with amazing pools and fun activities like in Western countries (unless new ones have opened up recently). They're still relaxing and fun places to go to, but personally 8 days seem a bit long as compared to staying longer in cities like Mandalay where there could be more for you to do. Up to you though!. My personal favorite beach is Chaung Thar, which is about 5, 6h drive from Yangon. You pass through Pathein on the way which has some cool traditional things like the handmade iconic Pathein umbrella. Chaung Thar is a favorite of many Burmese people, so it's quite busy but also dirty. There's also an island nearby that has really clear water and beautiful rocks, and now they also have rental services for banana boats, motorcycles, horse riding, cycling etc. If you prefer a quieter beach experience, then Ngapali and Ngwe Saung would be for you. Most foreigners like to go there for its blue waters and sandy white beaches. Hope you have a great time during your stay here! You really picked great places to see :).

V "Alexa, we have a problem," Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted after her 2-year-old accidentally ordered a Batman toy. "Alexa, we have a problem," Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted. (AP/Alex Brandon). White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that her 2-year-old ordered a Batman toy through Amazon's Alexa voice-shopping platform. Sanders said her kid did it by "yelling 'Batman!' over and over again into the Echo.". This anecdote shows that the ease of voice shopping cuts both ways for customers interested in convenience. Ordering items on Amazon from an Alexa-enabled device \u2014 so easy, a child could do it. It turns out that ease of use might be a little bit of an issue. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted on Sunday that her 2-year old kid was able to order a toy from the device just by shouting "Batman!" at it. "Alexa, we have a problem," she tweeted. Amazon has attempted to lessen the friction for customers by making voice ordering super easy \u2014 maybe too easy. Alexa probably isn't going to accept or recognize a command as simple as "Batman!" immediately without a follow-up check, but it's easy to see a circumstance where the device gets confused in a loud room with a lot of people talking. Alexa, we have a problem if my 2 year old can order a Batman toy by yelling "Batman!" over and over again into the\u2026 https://t.co/bY6RiVhHLV. \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) 2013-07-22 14:22:09.0 . Taking Sanders' account as accurate, this is a concern for Amazon as it gets more of its Alexa-enabled devices in homes. If the voice-shopping features are just too easy to use \u2014 or too easily fooled \u2014 Echo owners might turn off the feature altogether and write it off as more trouble than it's worth. Voice shopping is built for convenience, but an accidental order requires a lot more work, as customers will either have to ship the item back or reach out to the company to cancel it. Amazon does have safeguards against these kinds of accidental rogue orders. The app allows users to establish only certain voices as those that are enabled to purchase with their voice, or prompt select voices to give a specific four-digit code each time. This makes the whole process a bit less seamless, but can be a necessity for certain households \u2014 especially ones with kids that love to ask Alexa to play the "Frozen" soundtrack. As with any new platform, voice shopping has its kinks to work out.

V Tom Stagliano .  MIT Volunteer, interviewing freshmen for admissions . 51w ago. Is it OK to waste the time of the admissions staff who must review your application and to waste the time of the people who will write letters of recommendation for you?. No. MIT specifically wants:. SAT or ACT or TOEFL. Two SAT subject tests (one math and one science). It is Not OK to merely submit an application and ignore those required tests. It is OK to specifically contact MIT and Ask if the requirement for taking the standardized tests can be waived in your very specific case\u2026\u2026 That is OK. So contact MIT and be Specific. All the best.  Christopher Fox .  studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 62w ago. MIT will take the TOEFL for people who did not speak English as the first language in place of the ACT/SAT. MIT will require math and another science SAT subject test. Harvard will not take your application without the ACT/SAT and two SAT subjects tests. So no SAT tests at all, your application will be thrown out.  David McMillan .  studied at Drew University . 51w ago. being at one time they, the Ivys and MIT, were particular about the SAT I would say do not avoid it. Take the test and good luck. I am not sure how much weight is given to them anymore. BUT contact the admissions office and ask. DM.

VPatched up. A new patch is available now for the PC edition of PUBG. This is not the biggest or most significant of patches following the 1.0 release in December, but it does include some notable changes and fixes. Starting off, it includes a client optimisation that should improved general performance when a lot of players are in the same area simultaneously. If players are bunched up like this, you can expect there would be a big firefight, so it's good to know performance should now be better in such an important time in your gameplay session. There are also two bug fixes included with the new PUBG PC patch, the first of which fixes an issue where your character could be "instantly stopped and adjusted." The second fix is for a problem where the way your character moved during a replay seemed off. These are minor but welcome changes, and it's good to see developer PUBG Corp. continue to release updates to address the feedback fans have been sending in. In the developer's blog post announcing this patch, the studio also said it hopes to provide an update on what's next for PUBG in the near future. That's all PUBG Corp. had to say on the matter; we will report back when those details are announced. PUBG is also available in early access on Xbox One. Despite not running as well on the console, the game recently surpassed 3 million players. The Xbox One version also received a new update recently that fixed bugs and made other performance improvements. Another update added extra control options and more. PUBG PC Patch Notes:. Client Optimization. Reduced lowered performance issue when many players were in the same area. Bug Fixes. Fixed the issue where character movement was instantly stopped and adjusted. Fixed the issue where character movement seemed unusual during the replay.

VLEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Glowing red lava rolled down the slopes of a Philippine volcano Tuesday morning as authorities maintained a warning of a possible hazardous eruption. The lava was quietly flowing in some places but at times Mount Mayon was erupting like a fountain, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. Lava had advanced up to 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the crater, and ash reached up to 2 kilometers and fell on nearby communities. Nearly 15,000 people have fled the danger zone within 6 to 7 kilometers of Mayon, and the institute strongly advised people not to re-enter the area. Several small pyroclastic flows were generated by fragments in the lava streams and not by an explosion from the crater vent, like occurred with Mount Pinatubo, said Renato Solidum, who heads the volcano institute. Pyroclastic flows are superheated gas and volcanic debris that can race down slopes and incinerate everything in their path, and are feared in a major eruption. "The pyroclastic flows, there were several, were not generated by an explosion from the crater with lava, molten rocks and steam, shooting up the volcano then rolling down," Solidum said. "These were generated by lava fragments breaking off from the lava flow in the upper slopes.". He also said Mayon has not seen enough volcanic earthquakes of the type that would prompt scientists to raise the alert level to four, which would indicate an explosive eruption may be imminent. Emergency response officials previously said they may have to undertake forced evacuations if the alert is raised to four. After steam explosions Saturday and lava rising in the crater on Sunday, the alert was raised to three on a scale of five, indicating a hazardous eruption is possible "within weeks or even days.". Mayon lies in coconut-growing Albay province about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Manila. With its near-perfect cone, Mayon is popular with climbers and tourists but has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently. In 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings. Mayon's first recorded eruption was in 1616 and the most destructive in 1814 killed 1,200 people and buried the town of Cagsawa in volcanic mud. The Philippines lies in the so-called "Ring of Fire," a line of seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing about 800 people.

VOKO.  Ten people were killed and dozens injured on Wednesday in a double suicide-bomb attack in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, a civilian militia leader and a resident told AFP. The blasts happened in the Muna Garage area of the Borno state capital, in a market used mainly by internally displaced people (IDPs) from a nearby camp. \u201cI can confirm that 10 people have died in the attack,\u201d said Ibrahim Liman, of the Civilian Joint Taskforce (CJTF), which assists the military with security against Boko Haram. Liman initially gave the death toll as three but he added: \u201cSeven more bodies were brought in from the UMTH (University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital). \u201cNow the number of injured is 52,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo under-aged girls, aged about 13, struck at the market at about 4:10 pm (1510 GMT) \u2014 a peak hour. The first bomber set off her explosives in a sparsely populated part of the market. \u201cMoments later, the second bomber set off her explosives in the crowded part of the market. That was where most of the casualties were recorded.\u201d. Liman\u2019s account was supported by local resident Dahiru Bulama, who said soldiers had cordoned off the area as the injured were evacuated to hospital for treatment. \u201cThe attack was really bad. The casualty toll could be high. We were not allowed to go near,\u201d he added. . \u201cBut I saw one car parked across the road that was splattered with blood and flesh.\u201d. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Boko Haram has repeatedly used young girls and women as suicide bombers to attack civilian \u201csoft targets\u201d. IDP camps, including the one at Muna Garage, markets and mosques have been hit. Army and CJTF security posts have also been targeted. Twelve people were killed on November 15 when four suicide bombers \u2014 two men and two women \u2014 blew themselves up in the Muna area of Maiduguri. Wednesday\u2019s attacks comes after Boko Haram jihadists killed nine people on Monday in two separate attacks \u2014 one in the Ngala area of Borno and the second in neighbouring Adamawa. The attack in Ngala saw six people shot dead as they collected firewood to sell to IDPs. Civilians have borne the brunt of the casualties in the nearly conflict, with at least 20,000 killed and more than 2.6 million others made homeless since 2009.

VWe look to Lionel Logue, King George VI\u2019s speech therapist, whose manner may have been relaxed but whose dress sense was anything but. Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue in The King's Speech, 2010. The royals have a habit of being just the right amount of stylish, which makes them irresistible subjects for film-makers, but as a result of their elevated position, the people around them often get overlooked. In The King\u2019s Speech, speech therapist Lionel Logue is as integral a character as Colin Firth\u2019s King George VI, and the film explores the relationship between the two. Portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, whose perfectly-timed humour, relaxed attitude and Australian patriotism balances Firth\u2019s tightly-wound British stuffiness, Logue appears to be as committed to his clothes as he is to the seemingly impossible task at hand. Despite his unorthodox approach to therapy, his tailoring is traditional and distinguished; costume designer Jenny Beavan intentionally gave him a \u201cworking wardrobe\u201d of four suits, typical of a professional gentleman in the 1930s, and used photographs from the Logue family archives. A pinstriped navy double-breasted two-piece lends extra authority and authenticity to his character, with generous belly, roped shoulders, a high gorge and no vents. Considering the era restrictions, the suit is cut well for Rush\u2019s figure, but an updated version would include more flair in the skirt and more definition in the silhouette. Cifonelli\u2019s sweeping lapels sit a few inches higher, and a narrower pinstripe is easier to wear. Pair it with a tall pointed collar and motif-printed tie in vintage silk, elegant cufflinks and a perfectly curled silver cowlick. More importantly, conduct yourself with Logue\u2019s empathy, kindness and good humour, and you\u2019ll be channelling him whatever you wear. This week we look to speech therapist Lionel Logue in The King\u2019s Speech, whose manner may have been relaxed but whose dress sense was anything but.

VLIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian shamans said on Wednesday they expect good news from the visit of Pope Francis to the Andean nation, and held rituals on a beach near Lima to give him strength to fight against accusations of sexual abuse that have plagued the Roman Catholic Church. . Dressed in ponchos, the shamans passed rue leaves - believed to ward off evil and bring good luck - over photos of the Argentine pontiff, and stood by the ocean playing percussion instruments. . The pope lands in Peru on Thursday after finishing a trip to neighboring Chile. He will visit the Amazon jungle city of Puerto Maldonado and the northern city of Trujillo as well as the capital, Lima. . \u201cI see it going very well, above all in Trujillo and Puerto Maldonado. There will be good news and we ask the pope to pray with all the Andean priests,\u201d said shaman Juan Osco, as he tossed flower petals over the pope\u2019s image. . Peruvian shamans perform a ritual prior to the arrival of Pope Francis to Peru, at Pescadores beach in Chorrillos, Lima, Peru, January 17, 2018. REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo. \u201cWe want to congratulate Francis for being a leader with enough strength to get rid of pedophile priests,\u201d he said. . In Chile, Francis has faced protests from Catholics upset with his 2015 appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to head the diocese of Osorno. Barros denies accusations that he protected a priest found guilty in a Vatican investigation of abusing teenage boys. . Slideshow (2 Images). The pope, who also faces criticism in Peru for his handling of abuse allegations against the former leaders of an elite Catholic society, met with victims of child sexual abuse in Chile and expressed \u201cpain and shame.\u201d . Seen as kinder toward indigenous people than previous Church leaders, Francis will meet with Amazonian indigenous leaders on Friday. He shared a meal with Mapuche in Chile on Wednesday. . Shamans from different indigenous groups in Peru frequently give their visions for events, politicians and soccer games. .

V Naweed Ali .  Political commentator, Human rights activist . 60w ago. Different versions of Islamic Shariah and it's application around the world -. The various versions of Shariah are as a result of diversity in different schools of Islamic thought. The Hanbali school, Islam's most orthodox which spawned the Wahhabi and Salafi branches, is embraced in Saudi Arabia. The Hanafi school, known for being the most liberal and the most focused on reason and analogy, is dominant among Sunnis in Central Asia, Egypt, Pakistan, India, China, Turkey, the Balkans, and the Caucasus. The Maliki school is dominant in North Africa and the Shafi'i school in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, and Yemen. Shia Muslims follow the Ja'fari school, most notably in Shia-dominant Iran. The distinctions have impact on the legal systems in each country, however individual Muslims do not adhere to one school in their personal lives. In countries with classical Shariah systems, Shariah has official status or a high degree of influence on the legal system, and covers family law, criminal law, and in some places, personal beliefs, including penalties for apostasy, blasphemy, and not praying. These countries include Egypt, Mauritania, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Maldives, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and certain regions in Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates. Mixed systems are the most common in Muslim-majority countries. Generally speaking, Shariah covers family law, while secular courts will cover everything else. Countries include: Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, and Syria. In several Muslim-majority countries, Shariah plays no role: Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Tunisia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Albania, Kosovo, and Turkey. Some countries have Islamic family law courts available for their Muslim minorities: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, India, Israel, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

V Michael Dashkin .  Beginner Guitarist, Recovering Explainer. . 208w ago. I did a quick search and found these results of a survey published in May 2013 (of data gathered in 2011) by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed survey data collected from more than 450,000 U.S. adults ages 18 and older who were randomly phoned across all 50 states:.  "nearly 80 percent of adult Americans do not get the recommended amounts of exercise each week". "The survey revealed that only 20.6 percent of people met the total recommended amounts of exercise -- about 23 percent of all surveyed men and 18 percent of surveyed women. People most likely to exercise were between the ages of 18 and 24 (almost 31 percent of exercisers). Those least likely to engage in physical activity were ages 65 and older (nearly 16 percent of exercisers)". Those findings' quotes above refer to "recommended amounts" of exercise and I think you'll find a definition of the recommendations by following the CDC link, below. This is a link to a CBS News web page with a summary of the study's findings:. Page on Cbsnews. This is a link to the CDC web page with a summary of the study's findings:.

V Fred Landis .  Investigative Reporter . 315w ago. The most important event was the neutralization of CNN (TV network), the The New York Times, and The Washington Post domestically, and the institution of the practice of Embedded Journalism in Iraq. The hilarious description in Wikipedia of Embedded Journalism: "The US military responded to pressure from the country's news media who were disapointed at the level of access granted during the 1991 Gulf War". Ted Turner was not disappointed. The international reputation of CNN was based on their factual coverage of the first Iraq War. Peter Arnett remained behind with a small dish that in 1991 gave us a better image than the cell phone junk that is now accepted. Apart from the better image we had an honest reporter\u2014the same Peter Arnett who was so effective a journalist in Vietnam that both Gen Westmoreland and President LBJ tried to get him fired. During the second Iraq war there was no Ted Turner, no Peter Arnett, just a mindless imitator of Fox News. The New York Times completely betrayed the public: they ran disinformation planted by the The White House. Blame fell on Judith Miller, but recall that for one whole year The New York Times, and the rest of the complicit media, tried to paint her as a hero. There were 600 embedded "journalists" on the scene, all depending upon Pentagon facilities for their security and communications. Draw your own conclusions. The destruction in Iraq will be repaired faster than the credibility of the US media.

V Johnathan Fowler .  I've been keeping guinea pigs for about 15 years. . 49w ago. Yes, pears are a safe treat for guinea pigs. Don\u2019t give them too much, though. Pears are somewhat acidic and high in sugar\u2014 too much pear can lead to digestive issues and even obesity. As with other \u201ctreat\u201d foods, only offer a small amount of pear every few days to avoid any issues. Remember, hay and guinea pig food pellets are all your guinea pigs absolutely need to eat; fruits and vegetables are occasional treats.  James Smith .  Owned many pets and run a pet fact website. . 40w ago. Yes they can but only in moderation as they are very sweet and acidic. Make sure you cut them into smaller pieces so that they are not a choking hazard. Additionally it would be best to wash them thoroughly first. It is okay for a guinea pig to also eat the skin as well but not too much as its sweet as well. The benefits of pears is the high vitamin C content which is great for guinea pigs.

VProfessionals in the fields of sales, marketing, ICT and admin, office & support face positive employment prospects following an increase in hiring activity towards the end of 2017. This is according to jobs site Career Junction, which provided a detailed analysis of the relative ratio of supply and demand in the online job market. The CareerJunction Index (CJI) directly monitors the online labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. The information is based on professions across all industries. Career Junction said that the finance, construction and manufacturing sectors, on the other hand, saw a notable decrease in demand in recent months. Trending jobs for December include client/customer support, civil/structural engineering and IT project administration/management roles. The recruitment specialist underlined three \u2018hot\u2019 trending jobs in South Africa right now. Client/Customer Support. Average monthly salary offerings for an intermediate level position:. GP: R12,741 to R16,995. WC: R11,933 to R14,140. KZN: R10,025 to R12,925. Civil/Structural Engineering. GP: R34,461 to R47,325. WC: R25,720 to R36,477. IT Project Administration/Management. GP: R42,464 to R51,692. WC: R43,704 to R48,400. Most wanted skills. Career Junction said that more than 4 vacancies get activated every 10 minutes. \u201cThe constant stream of new opportunities begs the question: Which skill sets are most sought after?\u201d. The group\u2019s latest research showed that the following occupational fields are by far the most in demand skill sets in the job market currently:. Software Development: While recruitment activity slowed for most software developers during November and December, vacancies for .Net developers increased by 24% since October 2017. Representatives/Sales Consulting: Hiring activity for sales professionals increased considerably during 2017. Year-on-year, demand strengthened by 24%. However, despite the abundance of jobs, the job market remains competitive for job seekers. Middle/Department Management: Professionals in management face positive employment prospects. Financial managers are particularly well sought after. During the third quarter of 2017, every third managerial vacancy was allocated to financial managers.

VWASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker GAC Automobiles\u2019 plan to sell vehicles in the United States ran afoul of Washington trade politics on Wednesday, as the top U.S. Senate Democrat and U.S. President Donald Trump separately criticized Chinese trade practices. . GAC Automobiles, formally known as Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd, said Monday it plans to start selling vehicles in the United States in late 2019, potentially through a partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The southern Chinese automaker initially said it had hoped to start selling vehicles in the United States in 2017. . On Wednesday, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, cited GAC\u2019s plans announced in Detroit on the Senate floor Wednesday and argued that Chinese automotive trade rules are \u201cmanifestly unfair, and a typically unfortunate example of China\u2019s rapacious trading policies.\u201d . Chinese-built cars shipped to the United States face just a 2.5 percent tariff, while U.S.-built cars sent to China are hit with a 25 percent tariff. . Trump told Reuters in an interview Wednesday that \u201cwe have helped to build China because they have taken out so much money in terms of trade deficits with this country.\u201d . He said that \u201cwhen China or another country charges us 50 percent tariffs \u2013 more than that in some cases \u2013 and we charge them nothing, that\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d . While Schumer and Trump have clashed on many issues, the interests of Democrats and the Republican president are more aligned on automotive trade. Both want to win votes from auto workers in industrial states such as Michigan or Ohio whose jobs could be threatened should Chinese vehicles come to the United States in high volume. Leaders of the United Auto Workers union regularly raise concerns about U.S.-China automotive trade. . In 2016, General Motors Co became the first major automaker to sell a Chinese-made vehicle in the United States, importing its Buick Envision. GM sold 41,000 of the small SUVs in 2017. . Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd, has also been exporting vehicles from China to the United States since 2016. In June, Ford Motor Co said it would move some production of its Focus small car to China from Mexico and import the vehicles to the United States by 2019. . GAC could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday but confirmed this week it planned to change the name of vehicles sold in the United States from its flagship brand, Trumpchi to avoid confusion with Trump. It also plans to eventually sell vehicles in Europe. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Joseph White and Lisa Shumaker). Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

VAcura has made some announcements that fans of cars like the 2002 Acura RSX Type S pictured here will appreciate. Acura says that \u201cover the next few years\u201d the Type-S performance variants will return to its line and will be situated at the top of the core model lineup. Acura also has other performance-oriented plans for its cars. Acura is working on a new turbocharged V6 engine that will be exclusive to future Acura products. Presumably, that means it won\u2019t find a home under the hood of any Honda models. Acura will also be rolling out a new A-Spec sport styling variant of all Acura core models. The new turbo V6 will be paired with the new Acura Super Handling All-wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system that will launch with the new 2019 RDX. Acura plans to use that turbo V6 engine in multiple products in the coming years. The last Type-S badged car was the 2008 Acura TL with a track-tuned chassis, more powerful engine and brakes, and high-performance tires. That car also has sports-oriented interior and exterior features as well. The Acura A-Spec vehicles will build on the TLX A-spec version that Acura launched in 2017. There are A-Spec versions of every new core model in development says Acura. One of those models is a 2.4L TLX A-Spec that will land this spring. Acura also has an A-spec version of the all-new 2019 RDX that will launch with the rest of the RDX line in mid-2018. The first Acura A-Spec car was in 2004 and was the TL Sedan. SOURCE: Acura.

V As a Primer reader you already know the importance of controlling the image that you convey to the world. How you dress, how you carry yourself, how you speak, all these things factor into not only how others see you but how you see yourself. A man's home is an extension of himself, and just how his personal presentation affects his life, so does his home. Bringing a new date to your place, or a serious significant other's parents for the first time, can be a revealing experience. You can learn quite a bit about a man by visiting his home, from his view of the world, personal tastes, aesthetic style, and perhaps most revealing, his income level. But even more invaluable than the external is the importance of a comfortable home for yourself. The way furniture and furnishings are situated affect the feeling your home has. Does your seating enhance conversation with guests? Or is it all pointing at the television? Is it easy to navigate, or does it require stepping around couches and tables? Whether or not the ancient tradition of Feng Shui is a real thing doesn't matter, rooms can clearly \u201cflow\u201d or they can feel disjointed and separated. There's no question that the photos above are catalog shots. They feature furniture at unrealistic prices and items that probably won't work well in real life. (The giant steer skull above the bed looks cool, but I suspect it would feel very strange in person.) However, just like using our Getups for style inspiration, I encourage you to note the arrangement of furniture; the use of accents like rugs, lamps, and tables; the mixture of textures like wood and metal; the combination of art sizes and their juxtaposition; and deliberate color palettes as inspiration for ways you can apply the same principles to your own home. And just like dressing well on a budget, applying these ideas to what you already have doesn't require great expense.

VA 42-year-old dispatch rider, Olayemi Olalekan, is facing trial at a Yaba Chief Magistrates\u2019 Court, Lagos, for allegedly stealing his employer\u2019s N1.1 million. The accused has, however, been released on bail in the sum of N500, 000. Olalekan was arraigned on a charge of stealing to which he pleaded not guilty. The Magistrate, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oghre, who gave the ruling, also granted him two sureties in like sum. Oghre said the sureties must show evidence of means of livelihood and acceptable identification cards. Earlier, the Police Prosecutor, ASP Ibijoke Akinpelu told the court that the accused committed the offence between November and December 2017 at 56B, Moleye St., Alagomeji Yaba. Akinpelu said Olalekan, who was hired as a dispatch rider by MAX Delivery Ltd to deliver parcels to customers, had failed to remit monies paid by customers into the company\u2019s account. The accused converted the monies totalling N1.1 million to personal use, he said. The offence contravened Section 287 (1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). Newsmen report that the section prescribes seven years imprisonment for offenders. The case was adjourned until March 7 for trial. NAN.

VMochudi \u2014 President Lt Gen. Dr Seretse Khama Ian Khama paid a visit to Mr Isaac Davids' family in Mochudi following the demise of the Mochudi East legislator on January 15. He died on Sunday allegedly at the hands of his herdmen following a misunderstanding. President Khama told the family that he was in Ngami area when he received the sad news. He said he was shocked as he was with the late MP a few weeks ago during an event in Oodi. President Khama said this was something unexpected and both the family and the nation were shocked at the sudden departure of the MP. The Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Gladys Kokorwe said they had been working with Mr Davids in Parliament and they knew him as a hardworking man. She said he served in four parliamentary committees and did a sterling job adding that both the family and the nation at large, had lost a hardworker. A family elder, Mr Thomas Morobana told President Khama that they were still in shock after they received the sad news on Sunday and were yet to find out what really happened. The only brother left in the Davids family, Mr William Davids said they were shocked and horrified at the sudden departure of their brother whom they loved a lot. He said his brother was the breadwinner in the family of 10 children, six brothers and four sisters and he was the only brother left after the rest passed on. In an interview, Ms Carolyn Davids Okello-Wengi said his brother was born in 1950 in Kanye where he did his primary education and continued later at Bakgatle New School. She said he did a plumbing course in Italy in the 1970's after which he came back and worked for Botswana Technology Centre for a long time. Ms Okello-Wengi said he later left and started businesses, which included welding, plumbing and borehole drilling. She said his brother loved farming and was well known for the Brahman breed, which he reared with all his heart adding that he became one of the greatest farmers in Kgatleng. She further said Mr Davids joined politics in the 80's and won his first parliamentary seat in 1999. The late MP is survived by wife, four sons and daughter.

VImagine, two of the greatest Nintendo 64 games, mashed up into one epic late '90s adventure featuring a lot of wahoo-ing. Modders Trenavix, Waschpenner and Shyguyhex have thrown favourites Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie together \u2014 and it works pretty damn well. Using the SM64Paint program, the modders have dropped your ol' pal Mario right into the "Spiral Mountain" level of the game usually inhabited by an agreeable bear, Banjo, who carries his bird best friend around in a backpack (that lazy Kazooie). BK's collectable musical notes have been replaced with Mario's red coins, and enemy Goombas and Shy Guys have replaced Spiral Mountain's usual cohort of aggressive carrots and cauliflowers. But it doesn't stop at the intro level \u2014 the modders have appropriated a large portion of the game. A demo of the mash-up game Super Banjo-Kazooie 64 is available to download with 18 Jiggies (jigsaw puzzle pieces, if you've forgotten) to find, along with a secret stage.

V FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump displays his signature after signing the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul plan in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst. Americans\u2019 support for the recently signed Republican tax reform bill is soaring, growing nine percent in favorability since Christmas. Forty-six percent of Americans either strongly or somewhat approve of the law as of early January, compared to just 37 percent when the bill was entering the final stages of debate in late December, The New York Times reported Tuesday. Americans are also becoming increasingly optimistic when evaluating their own finances and the overall economy. Increased optimism is likely due to large stock market gains, increasing economic growth and other positive economic indicators. Big business leaders are also increasingly positive about the state and future of the American economy. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon thinks 4 percent economic growth this year is absolutely a possibility. \u201cThe economy is doing quite well,\u201d Dimon told Fox Business\u2019s Maria Bartiromo earlier in January. \u201cIf we have a couple of years of good growth, that could justify the markets where they are. Four percent economic growth this year is possible.\u201d. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, posting the best back-to-back quarterly growth rates in three years. Strong growth is only expected to continue, as some economists are anticipating stronger fourth-quarter growth figures following the passage of the GOP tax reform bill. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economists released a prediction that could give Dimon\u2019s predictions some more credibility. The economic research team at the St. Louis FED estimates that there is only a 4 percent chance the U.S. economy enters a recession in 2018.  Freedom of Speech Isn\u2019t Free.

V Abhishek D .  Algo & HFT guy . 18w ago. If the turtle species is on the The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species you can forget about it. Red eared sliders are extensively bred and available in many pet stores. However, caring for them is not easy and they have very specific needs. You also need to be careful about food poisoning (salmonella) that can be caused by reptiles. My family had 2 for close to 8 years and we ended up rehabilitating them in a zoo.  Amrut Patil . 17w ago. It is illegal to pet some turtles due to the following reasons :-. The turtle species maybe an endangered one. The turtle may be an invasive species which has already caused an ecological imbalance where you are living. But fortunately for someone who would appreciate to pet a turtle I think a red eared slider would make an perfect pet due to it's easy availability in pet stores,easy maintenance and cheap prices(as compared to other turtles or tortoises).thankyou.

V Hersh Davis - Nitzberg .  Founder of Repair Bad Reputation http://repairbadreputation.com/ . 166w ago. If someone did try to tarnish your reputation and you try to sue them you would have to sue based upon defamation of character which is not an easy thing to prove and a very expensive process. In order to prove defamation you would need to prove that the information posted was not only not true but posted in order to intentionally tarnish your image or reputation. Furthermore, if someone were to anonymously tarnish your reputation it would be almost impossible to track them down. If posted on a site that is a third party site (like facebook) it would then be impossible to get the information down because of a law (most are not familiar with) called the communications decency act or CDA. I would recommend being proactive with your reputation working to build a better reputation before your reputation is tarnished. .  I am anonymous becauseI don't want anyone to Google me and drive up this item - I have something negative that has shown up for 8 years despite a lot of content on the internet. Then, some absolute a__hole found a response I had written on a thread on a social networking site in which I talked about this, and he sent it to everyone I knew, as in clients. Haha, I reviewed him on RipOff Report. All true stuff, he was a complete piece of *&^%. .  Melissa Hoy .  Well rounded and well read about a large variety of things. . 210w ago. I've Googled myself and discovered there are a lot of people with my name! You have to go to the second page of results to find anything that's actually mine. I don't have a big online presence for personal reasons so I don't really have any issues. Anything that's going to "tarnish" me will probably be posted here!. EDIT: Or tweeted by John Hill ! ;).

V Kah Seng Tay .  Quora Haqathon problem setter and co-organizer . 161w ago. My opinion as one of the co-organizers (and only one across all 4 past contests that we've done) is that this has been the hardest contest we've ever done, but also one where we've had the strongest showing of contestants (no offense intended to previous contest winners). Several reasons:. Our problem setting team was really strong this year, with many recent top competitive coders, who set really interesting and hard problems. . The contest duration has remained roughly the same through the past few contests (around 5-8 hours), while having 9 problems to solve. The problems spanned many more domains this time, requiring algorithms, machine learning and distributed systems knowledge as well as fast accurate coding skills to do well. Few of the contestants were able to be well-versed in all of these areas, although several were good in at least 2. The machine learning problems used real-world data from our production databases (only publicly viewable information, and community owned/edited content though). There is no perfect solution or even "textbook approach" to solving such problems, making it impossible to get full scores. I've also asked some of the contestants to answer to see how they think it compares to other competitions they've seen. .  Jiaxing Liang .  Computer Science Student . 161w ago. I like the problem set a lot. . Six algorithm problems: The 1st one Archery and the 3rd one Upvotes are easy, people without any competitive programming experiences could solve them. The Schedule and Related questions are not that straight forward I guess. Math and graph knowledge are needed for these two problems. I don't know how to solve Ontology and Wombats yet. Some fancy algorithms or data structures may be needed if people would like to solve them. Two machine learning problems: I am not good at solving machine learning problems. To get half of the score, I just applied some basic techniques such as tf-idf in my code without any real 'Machine Learning' algorithms. Distributed System: This was the first time I saw this kind of problem. It was difficult for people without socket programming experience to solve it. Glad to see that the contest has been extended to a week. .

V Nisha Yadav .  Project Engineer at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (2008-present) . 30w ago. Yes as well as NO! Its all depend upon how you are using-. Cheap nail paints definitely going to harm your nails. Always use good quality nail paints (like lakme, chambor, Dabora, etc\u2026.). Do not cover your nails all the time with paints, let them breath. Oxygen is very important for the nails, remove nailpolish once in a week. keep nails bare for one day or two. If by chance your nails look yellow, then rub one lemon on your nails & keep it for 10 min,then wash off. After ward apply olive oil on the nails and keep it for whole night. (this procedure ideally should be done before going to bed at night. ).  Pranav Skin and Cosmetology Clinic .  Doctor Aruna Prasad . 30w ago. Constant application of nail polish can discolour your nails. They can turn anything from yellow to brown. Always give a gap between two applications.

VPolice in Ghana say three men who were arrested on Monday with explosives in a suburb of the capital Accra, have been remanded by an Accra District Court. The police gave the names of the suspects as.  Ismaila Ali Musah, Abdul Karim Yakubu and Osman Hassan, the added that the three had been charged with the offence of possession of explosives. They are to reappear on 30th January, 2018. . Police asked that anybody with related information should contact police emergency lines. Some online media portals linked the arrests to persons associated to the Islamic State group. Police is investigating the matter in coordination with the relevant agencies and therefore assures the public to remain calm. But security experts have dismissed the possibility urging the media to stay out of reporting speculations as the relevant authorities get to the bottom of the matter. The arrest of the trio was upon a tip-off and the police continues to conduct investigations into the matter. Local media reports said they suspects were arrested with at least seven grenades. \u201cPolice is investigating the matter in coordination with the relevant agencies and therefore assures the public to remain calm,\u201d said an initial statement issued by Assistant Commissioner David Eklu.

VNAIROBI, Jan 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - United Nations experts have called on Kenyan authorities to halt forceful evictions of the Sengwer, a tribe living in the forest of western Kenya who say they are being forced off their ancestral land to make way for a water conservation project. . The Sengwer say they have faced a fresh wave of evictions by forest guards from Embobut forest to pave the way for an European Union-funded project to protect water catchment areas. . Dozens of Kenya Forest Service (KFS) guards started evicting people from the forest in late December in what they said were operations targeted at forest invaders. . But a statement from the U.N. experts said more than 100 armed forest service guards entered the traditional lands of the Sengwer in the Embobut forest, firing gunshots, burning at least 15 homes and killing their livestock. . Yator Kiptum, a Sengwer community activist said at least 70 houses had been razed by the forest guards. . \u201cThe Sengwer are facing repeated attacks and forced evictions by agents of the Kenya Forest Service, which is an implementing agency in the project financed by the European Union,\u201d three independent experts appointed by the United Nations said in a statement on Monday. . \u201cConsultations have not been held with the Sengwer to seek their free, prior and informed consent,\u201d the statement said. . The Sengwer hunter-gatherers have fought with the government for more than five decades for the right to live in the Embobut forest in the Cherengany Hills from where they were first evicted by British colonialists in the 19th century. . The three U.N. special rapporteurs \u2013 John Knox, Michel Forst and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz \u2013 asked Kenya to halt the evictions and launch an investigation. . They also asked the EU to suspend funding of a 31 million euro ($38 million) water tower project that was launched in mid-2016. . Responding to the U.N. statement, Stefano Dejak, who heads the EU delegation to Kenya, said both human rights and climate action were top priorities. . The EU-funded programme seeks to conserve forests around hills in the western part of Kenya considered water catchment towers. . \u201cOne of them should not be sacrificed for the other: actions to protect them should go hand in hand,\u201d said Dejak. . An official at Kenya's environment ministry said KFS had not undertaken any forced evictions in Embobut forest and the government was working to resettle the Sengwer people elsewhere.

V Mark Gritter .  Stanford CS PhD dropout . 111w ago. This is an easy recurrence because [math]n[/math] doesn't appear in the cost anywhere. So all we need to do is understand how many [math]\u005csqrt{n}[/math]'s it takes to get to 2 or below. [math]\u005csqrt{n} = n^{\u005cfrac{1}{2}}[/math]. [math]\u005csqrt{\u005csqrt{n}} = (n^{1/2})^{1/2} = n^{1/4}[/math]. [math]\u005csqrt{\u005csqrt{\u005csqrt{n}}} = n^{1/8}[/math]. and so on. K iterated square roots take [math]n[/math] to [math]n^{1/(2^K)}[/math]. Solving for K gives us:. [math]n^{1/(2^k)} \u005cleq 2[/math] . [math] 2^{-k} \u005clog n \u005cleq \u005clog 2[/math]. [math] -k \u005clog 2 + \u005clog \u005clog n \u005cleq \u005clog \u005clog 2[/math]. [math]k \u005cgeq O( \u005clog \u005clog n)[/math] (if you pardon the abuse of notation). Thus, the recurrence is [math]O( \u005clog \u005clog n )[/math] because the constant terms are irrelevant. Sanity check: . If [math]n = 2^4[/math] we need to apply the square root twice. If [math]n = 2^{1024}[/math] it takes us 10 iterations, so obviously the order of growth is much smaller than [math]\u005clog n[/math].

VOne man was killed while another was injured on Sunday, when armed men attacked Dundi-Maiyanga village in Kwall, Bassa local government, Plateau State. A source from the village told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), yesterday that three men were attacked by the armed men that used machetes and cutlasses. \u201cThe three men are brothers; they were in the house when the attackers descended on them, killing one and injuring another, while the other one escaped unhurt,\u201d the source told NAN. Confirming the incident, Terna Tyopev, spokesman of the Plateau Police Command, told NAN that the incident took place Sunday night. \u201cFrom the report sent to us, unknown armed men attacked three people at Dundi-Maiyanga village in Kwall District and killed one Sunday Lale, using machetes. \u201cLale\u2019s brother, Ayuba, also suffered massive cuts on his body and is currently at the Catholic Hospital, Kwall,\u201d he said. Tyopev said that Sunday\u2019s corpse had been evacuated by personnel of the Special Task Force on security in Plateau. He said that investigation was in progress and urged the affected community to be calm and avoid the temptation to attack people they suspected might be responsible for the incident.

V Dan Shappir .  works at Wix . 53w ago. Disclaimer: I work at Wix, but all opinions expressed in my answers are my own. Check out these sample sites created with Wix and make up your own mind: Explore Wix Website Examples | Web Design Inspiration | Wix.com. Unlike some other website builders, Wix focuses on giving you as much creative freedom as possible. At the same time, we also offer lots of good starting points in a huge collection of templates. And you can try Wix out for free.  Tom Dringer .  Web Developer at Eigotec (2006-present) . 54w ago. You can, but essentially someone else will have a similar design, look and feel to you. The pro\u2019s with something like Wix though is everything has already been thoroughly tested so you can put it all together and launch it straight away knowing it will work on pretty much any device.  Tom Miller . 52w ago. I guess my first question is what does \u201cgreat (web)sites\u201d mean to you?. If you can design a great website then it becomes of question of can you transfer that design to Wix? I expect it will \u201cdepend\u201d on exactly what that design involves. Too many beginners (including me) think \u201cdesigning\u201d a website starts when you sit down with the tool to start creating your website. Design starts back at the question of \u201cWhat problem are we trying to solve here\u201d and moves forward with getting the right requirements, documenting the requirements, doing the UX (User Experience) process as part of the design and then you get around to trying to code the website. At that stage of the game then the question of Wix\u2019s ability to \u201caccept direction\u201d will come into play. Note, I have not ever created a website using Wix so I have no ideas about its flexibility. 2) Read all the contract details before you sign up at Wix or any other Website creation/hosting company. Understand who \u201cowns\u201d your content and your \u201cpresentation\u201d. HTH,. Tlm.  Waqee Haidar . 54w ago. Yes, You can do it. But if you have experience. Otherwise Free is free. You need professional Assistance for do amazing work. Thanks. Waqee Haidar.  Uziel Almeida Oliveira .  Websites and Joomla extensions developer . 53w ago. No. The sad true is this: never. You can not build complex websites with wix. For small business is ok. For small internet based focuses is ok too. But for large websites or big companies, it\u2019s tottally impossible.  Joe Knapp .  I have been working on the Internet before there were browsers. . 53w ago.

VJan 17 (Reuters) - Canada said on Wednesday it is creating an independent watchdog to monitor and investigate human rights abuses by its companies operating abroad, describing it as the first initiative of its kind in the world. . Canada\u2019s mining, oil and gas sectors had been expecting Ottawa to announce an ombudsman to keep tabs on their offshore business, a move that environmental and human rights groups have long demanded. . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party made a campaign promise in 2015 to appoint such a watchdog. . Non-government groups have called for years for greater oversight of Canadian mining companies abroad following a number of environmental incidents and accusations of human rights abuses, including that of forced labor at Canadian miner Nevsun Resources\u2019 mine in Eritrea. Nevsun has denied the allegations. . The office, to be named the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, will initially focus on the mining, oil and gas, and garment sectors, but is expected to be expanded to other business sectors within a year of the Ombudsperson taking office, international trade minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement. . Its mandate will be to help solve disputes or conflicts between communities and Canadian companies, the statement said. . Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Conservative Stephen Harper, established a Corporate Social Responsibility Counselor in 2009, but critics have said it is toothless as the office focuses mainly on facilitating dialogue between companies and affected communities.

VDar es Salaam \u2014 President John Magufuli on Tuesday received diplomatic credentials of six new ambassadors and high commissioners posted to Tanzania. The new envoys include Sahabu Isah Gada of Nigeria, Krzysztof Buzalski of Poland, Ali Davutoglu of Turkey, Frédéric Clavier of France, Noah Gal Gendler of Israel and Alison Chartres of Australia, according to a statement issued by the Director of Presidential Communications, Mr Gerson Msigwa. However, Israel and Australia have yet to officially open fully-fledged embassies in Tanzania. Mr Gendler of Israel and Mr Chartres of Australia will operate from Nairobi, Kenya, where the two countries' embassy and high commission, respectively, are based, Mr Msigwa said. The Israeli government pledged in 2014 to establish a fully-fledged embassy in Dar es Salaam to make it easier for the two countries to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties. President Magufuli congratulated the envoys on their appointments and assured them of the Tanzanian government's commitment to strengthening diplomatic relations with the nations to achieve political and economic development. He also urged the ambassadors to invite investors to come and invest in the country. He specifically pointed out such sectors as agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and mining as having great potentials that was yet to be exploited.

V Michal Fori\u0161ek .  teacher, scientist, competitive programmer . 47w ago. I\u2019ll try picking a few of my favorite books. This is all written off the top of my head, so I\u2019ll surely forget many of them. Juraj Hromkovi\u010d\u2019s book Algorithmic Adventures is a lovely introduction to the breadth and beauty of computer science. If you have little experience with CS and think that CS is just about writing programs, pick up this book. If you have or teach young children, you really should read Computer Science Unplugged by Tim Bell, Ian Witten, and Mike Fellows. This lovely book contains a collection of games and activities that teach CS concepts without even touching a computer. Math books are not CS books per se, but they are still related enough for me to mention them. I have always been fond of discrete math, so there\u2019s no wonder I\u2019ll mention Concrete Mathematics by Ron Graham, Don Knuth and Oren Patashnik. Another great book from this category is László Lovász\u2019s book Combinatorial Problems and Exercises. Dave Mount\u2019s lecture notes on computational geometry are a thing of beauty. Tom Ferguson\u2019s book Game Theory covers a wide range of topics that fall into combinatorial and \u201ceconomic\u201d game theory very well. The books by Raymond Smullyan. Not just the classics with all the logic puzzles (e.g., What is the Name of This Book? and The Lady or the Tiger?), but notably To Mock a Mockingbird in which he uses a lovely metaphor and a collection of puzzles to introduce the topic of combinatorial logic. An advanced algorithms textbook that caught my fancy is Dexter Kozen\u2019s short book The Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Dexter\u2019s writing style suits me very well. A notable property of the textbook is the brevity of presentation: there is no fluff, everything is presented in the most compact and concise way possible. Doug Stinson\u2019s Cryptography Theory and Practice is a must-read for anyone interested in cryptography and computer security. Continuing with the textbook parade, Dan Gusfield wrote the stringology bible, Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences. And finally, I\u2019m pretty happy with the tiny book I co-wrote with Monika Steinová. This is, of course, the book Explaining Algorithms Using Metaphors.

VWindhoek \u2014 Two young women have come up with an initiative called 'Ladies Talk' with a purpose of empowering and encouraging teenage girls, especially those about to enter university. Raynel Rauna Kahenge and Aina Johannes, who are both 20, say through Ladies Talk they hope to dispense advice to fellow young people on issues affecting teenage girls in the country. They also hope to use the initiative as a platform to discuss whatever challenges young Namibian women face on a daily basis. "Our aim is to build strong women by encouraging self-confidence and self-love; and also encouraging women to develop entrepreneurial skills with the quality to ascertain independence, women empowerment and knowledge of their human rights," says Kahenge. They plan to host their first discussion on February 3, in Windhoek, with the speaker of the Namibian Youth Parliament, Norman Ndeuyeeka, as the special guest. "During our first talk, we are going to share life challenges we are currently facing as young women, share each other's experiences and teach one another on how we can handle issues affecting us," Kahenge adds. She says interested teenagers should take part in their one-on-one free mentorship course and also teach other young girls in their circles, communities or at their schools. "We want to move this initiative to every corner of the country, so that every girl benefits from our programme.". The initiative is targeting those that need help in dealing with youth matters such as teenage pregnancies and being teen mothers, relationships matters, alcohol and drug abuse, careers, school issues and many others. Kahenge called on teenage girls to show up in their numbers to their first interaction.

VIt sounds like Dodge's SRT division has been put on notice.  Today, we got pretty excited about the Ford Mustang Bullitt. We honestly weren't expecting it. In recent weeks some of us around the Autoblog office postulated \u2014 hoped, in fact \u2014 that Ford would surprise us with a new Shelby GT500 at the Detroit Auto Show. The Bullitt was more than enough excitement, though, we had decided.  After day one of NAIAS 2018 closed, our carrier pigeons surprised us with this new video from Ford, teasing the GT500 some of us had hoped to see. Take a look for yourself in the video above, but keep in mind these words from Ford, literally the title of the (brief) accompanying press release: "Most Powerful Street-Legal Production Ford Ever: All New Mustang Shelby GT500 To Attack Tracks, Drag Strips In 2019.".  It sounds like Dodge's SRT division has been put on notice.  Scant more details from Ford: . \u2013 Arriving in 2019, the all-new Mustang Shelby GT500 will be the pinnacle of Mustang performance and highlights the innovation, ingenuity and passion of Ford Performance.  \u2013 With more than 700 horsepower projected, the all-new Shelby GT500 fast-back coupe will be twice as powerful as the original 1967 Mustang performance model.  Loaded with the most venom ever, the all-new Mustang Shelby GT500 with its 700-plus horsepower supercharged V8 will be the most powerful street-legal production Ford ever.  Embodying Ford Performance team's motorsport expertise, this new Mustang is engineered to stand apart on roadways and race tracks, thanks to its new innovative track technologies, performance hardware, plus aggressive and functional track-tuned styling.  Consider our interest piqued. We'll be back with more details as soon as they're available, but we did spot a new front splitter, a vented hood, massive brakes, and larger exhaust in the brief video above. In the meantime, we're lacing up our driving shoes and practicing our water box burnouts.

V Jephin Joseph .  Rational philosopher ! . 34w ago. Education. When you attend classes for gaining knowledge, that's ambition. When you attend classes just for some degree which will make you look good infront of others, that's greed. Power. When you want to acquire something with your power without harming anyone, that's ambition. When you want to acquire everything using your power just for your own good, harming others, that's greed. Love. When you have feelings for her which is why you want to propose her, that's ambition. When you don't have any feelings for her, but you have your eyes on her property, that's greed. Relationships. When you want to have a good relationship with everyone, out of a noble heart, that's ambition. When you want to have a good relationship with everyone, out of a cunning mind, that's greed. Quora. When you want to write answers on this platform, only out of your love for writing, that's ambition. When you want to write answers on the platform, without any love for writing, just for the sake of social status and upvotes, that's greed. In short, difference between the two is extremely minute. There's only a very thin line between them. Let's call it 'purpose'. Whenever any aim has a noble purpose attached to it, for everyone's benefit and without harming anyone, that's ambition. Once you cross the thin line, you enter the land of 'greed' !. If in case,. You're wondering,. I'm Jeff !. We'll meet again,. Until then, take care !!.

V Suzanne Estévez .  works at NSF International . 104w ago. You need a very strong acetone nail polish remover. I buy a shellac one but I understand you can use normal nail polish removers but make sure it's very high in acetone. I cut up pieces of cotton wool. I'll soak a piece, squeeze out the excess and then wrap around my nail. Then I get a square piece of tin foil and wrap it around my nail, encasing all the cotton wool. Make sure it's wrapped tight. Do all the nails on one hand and let soak for about 10 to 12 minutes. Check a nail to see if the polish easily scrapes off. If it doesn't, soak for a couple more minutes. Then do the other hand. NEVER peel dry shellac off your nails. You'll ruin the natural nail, and risk ripping the surface. Be patient with the soaking...it will come off! .  Kristen Judge .  Makeup Artist/ Beauty Professional . 182w ago.  Hi! Firstly you need to break down the seal of the Shellac. See how shiny and glossy it is? That's a seal that's created when curing the gel so it had optimum staying power. Using a nail file, lightly buff over your nails to take away the shine. This breaks down the barrier so when you soak your nails in acetone (works best - acetone nail polish remover is like "watered down acetone" 100% acetone is ideal) it will break down the shellac quicker. Hope this helps!. -KR x .  Sim Portia .  Certified nail tech . 182w ago.  With all brands of gel polish you should always use the remover that comes with the gel polish system. However Acetone will work, too,but you have to soak cotton pads, place on nail, wait for 10-15 min. Or even longer. Also, sometimes the longer you wear you gel polish, the harder it will be to remove. .  Lily Ouyang . 26w ago. If you want to remove your nail polish cleanly, i will suggest you use the nail gel polish removal tool . i hope my suggestion will help you.  Diana Margarita .  Professional Nail Technician and Beauty Therapist for 25 years . 139w ago.  Soak your nails in acetone. .  Yang Leo . 26w ago.

V Lisa Holtham .  Profesional Manicurist, 25+ yrs experience. Specialty: gel and natural nails. . 57w ago. Gel is a liquid by definition. If it involves powder it is technically acrylic in a combination of powder and monimer (liquifier and curing activator), or powder added to gel for enhanced strength. Each requiring sculpting, or shaping and smoothing along with a top coat finish that can include a UV cured gel option, which is sometimes the only basis for calling the finished product \u2018gel nails\u2019. A true gel is a heavy liquid gel applied with a brush and cured under a UV light. It is self leveling and needs no shaping unless used to sculpt. It is self sealing and cures with the famous \u2018gel shine\u2019 that gel top coats give even to acrylic nails.  Jessica Zastoupil .  former Licensed Master Nail Tech since 1999 . 57w ago. There is no such thing as powder gel - it is called gel because it is in the form of a gel - like hair gel. so-called "powder gel" is literally just clear acrylic.  Sky Fan . 13w ago. if you want to know more details about the gel nail , mailly different in the liquid .

V Rajashri Bala . 141w ago.  Most Indian parents have notions of what constitutes "clean" and "purity" with respect to their homes. . A dog is perceived unclean because it may eat non-vegetarian foods, doesn't have understanding of where to litter and has a characteristic smell. . These things are generally unacceptable in a orthodox or semi-orthodox Indian household. .  Joydeep Roy Chowdhury .  Managing Director (2015-present) . 34w ago. A dog Adoption scam starts with some foreigner will contact you from a different city or country & ask you to adopt their puppy for a little sum of money. Then when you transfer the money, they would tell you they are transporting the dog to you. Then you would receive a mail from a rogue transporter agency stating that you have to buy an travel insurance which would be refunded 90 percent along with the dog. They would claim the dog cannot travel without insurance. After you pay that, they would delay the process & ask for the boarding & lodging fees. After you again transfer then they would come up with a story of dog being sick so has to go through the quarantine. It's a vicious cycle of asking more & more money and finally the dog would never reach you & slowly you would realise that you have been scammed.  Karthick V K .  Quora is my Library . 38w ago.

V Brian Barr .  Traveler, Entrepreneur, Strategy Gamer, Avid Reader. . 33w ago. They probably use a wide variety of softwares across their many teams. As Diane points out, some use SmartSheets. I know they also have a Trello Business or Enterprise account. Google doesn\u2019t seem like the type of company that tries to force thousands of different employees, teams, and projects to conform to a single workflow. I\u2019m sure there are teams that still rely 100% on sticky notes and whiteboards at Google too.  Ljubisa Vukovic .  IT Project Manger (2007-present) . 23w ago. Interesting question.

V Menglong Zhu .  Computer Vision PhD . 140w ago. The key to Proximal algorithm is the Proximal operator. What is Proximal operator?. Proximal operator is equivalent to implicit gradient (or backward Euler). The gradient update is not using the (sub)gradient estimated at the current point [math]x^k[/math]. Instead, it finds the (sub)gradient at next point [math]x^{k+1}[/math]. . Implicit gradient / backward Euler is computed by solving:. [math]x^{k+1} = x^k - \u005clambda \u005cnabla f(x^{k+1})[/math]. In comparison, explicit gradient descent / forward Euler is given as:. [math]x^{k+1} = x^k - \u005clambda \u005cnabla f(x^k)[/math]. Let's take a look at proximal update of [math]x^k[/math]:. [math]\u005ctextbf{prox}_f(x^k) = \u005ctext{argmin} f(x) + \u005cfrac{1}{2\u005clambda}|| x - x^k||^2[/math]. The optimal condition is given by:. [math]0 = \u005clambda\u005cnabla f(x^*) + (x^* - x^k)[/math]. Notice that [math]x^* = x^k - \u005clambda\u005cnabla f(x^*)[/math] is exactly the proximal update. Now, let's come back to the algorithm itself. Proximal algorithm is just a series of iterative updating step to find the following fix point:. [math]x^* = \u005ctextbf{prox}_f(x^*)[/math]. When is Proximal algorithm useful?. Proximal algorithm is a great tool to solve non-smooth, constrained, large-scale or distributed optimization problems. A particular application of the proximal algorithm in primal-dual problem is that it sequentially updates the primal and dual variables to find the saddle point of the energy function.

VGoogle is trying to speed up mobile searches. Google searches on your phone are about to get an important upgrade. The company announced an upcoming "speed update" to search, which will put some slower loading pages lower down in search results on mobile devices. Google says it expects the speed update, set to take effect in July, will only affect "a small percentage of queries," but given the number of Google searches that happen on a daily basis, it could have a significant impact on search. Under the change, Google will take page speeds into account in determining its rankings for mobile searches. The company has previously used speed as a factor on desktop, but this will mark the first time Google has done so on mobile. While not a surprising move considering that the bulk of Google searches come from mobile devices, the change has some interesting implications in the long run. Though Google says the change will only affect a small number of searches, it could incentivize more sites to adopt the company's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), stripped-down versions of web pages that load very quickly. . That's not to say that AMP pages will automatically be given priority. Google notes that the change only looks at the speed of a particular page, "regardless of the technology used to build the page," and the company told Search Engine Land that AMP pages could still be ranked lower if they load slowly. . But considering that AMP tends to be significantly faster than the traditional mobile web, the speed update would certainly seem to give an edge to sites that use the technology.

V Bruce Neben .  40 years studying and treating mental illness including schizophrenia. . 184w ago. "Mild" schizophrenia could possibly go away, but probably will not. However it will most likely not impair normal activities or be disabling. It will be important for the person with "mild" schizophrenia to manage levels of stress and get enough sleep. Symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confused or illogical thought) may be present only during times of unmanaged stress. This person may not need psychiatric medications normally prescribed for individuals with schizophrenia. However it will be important to make sure that the diagnosis is correct, therefore a proper psychological assessment by a trained mental health professional is necessary. . It is possible that a person who thinks that s/he has mild schizophrenia, may not have schizophrenia at all. Ten percent of normal persons have hallucinations at least once in their lives. Additionally, there are various other reasons why people have these symptoms, including alcohol or drug intoxication, head injury, and a large variety of physical conditions under which these symptoms are not common, but can occur.  Jonas Kofoed .  Has early-onset Paranoid Schizophrenia . 94w ago. There is a slight possibility, though it will most likely not. There have been some cases where schizophrenics no longer have any symptoms, but most will either have symptoms all their life, or some may no longer have positive symptoms, but still negative symptoms. And unless this " mild schizophrenia" gives problems in the "mild schizophrenic's" life, then it won't be considered schizophrenia. Like, there are people who hear voices that aren't schizophrenics. Though, one is unlikely to have the symptoms of schizophrenia without it causing problems.  Don Karp .  I have lived experience--10 years in and out of mental hospitals. . 88w ago. Schizophrenia is a medical term made up to diagnose and control people. Do you want to be controlled?. You ask about what I think is a probability. Do you want to be a statistic?. Human potential is unlimited. To heal or not is your choice, not medical nor statistical. If you've a strong enough intention, you can do anything!.

V Rick Smith .  Pharmacy Technician (Ret.) & Polyglot Interpreter . 21w ago. While beauty is a very subjective thing, I believe it would be hard for a North Korean woman to outshine her countrywomen in the south. The overwhelming majority of North Koreans are malnourished because of persistent, grinding poverty and an unreliable food supply. The government used to distribute all foodstuffs through central dispensaries, but in recent years this is no longer guaranteed. As a result of these factors, people in the north are shorter and underweight compared to those in the south. Traditionally, the best resources available were diverted toward the military and Worker\u2019s Party elite. Over the past few years, even these formerly fortunate people have had to fend for themselves. There have been many reports of rogue soldiers demanding food from civilians at gunpoint, so it appears that things are getting even more desperate than usual.  Ken Eckert .  English Professor, South Korea (Canadian) . 23w ago. There\u2019s an expression in South Korea, \u201csouthern man, northern woman.\u201d When I talk to older Korean men here, many have a fetish about how sexually attractive and submissive northern women are. Korean men (again, at least the older generation) tend to like petite, girlish women with moony, China-doll faces. The western expats I have worked with in Korea have nearly all married or dated women from the south of the country, who tend to be more tomboyish and curvy. So there\u2019s no answer to the question, because 75 million people aren\u2019t all the same, and because everyone has their own preferences in beauty. But these are the tendencies I\u2019ve observed.  Sungho Park .  Managing Editor at Electronic Arts (2015-present) . 23w ago. We\u2019re both Koreans. We are both the same ethnicities. Why would an artificial political border suddenly change beauty?.

V Paul Cooper .  I love Warhammer 40k and know a lot about its lore . 21w ago. Well for one, the number of chapters is huge and the details on the chapter master of each is definitely lacking detail so you will never get an answer to that. Secondly, terminator armor is not the same as the standard of power armor worn by the common astartes. Not only do you need to learn how to use it, but you are slower in it. It\u2019s the middle point between dreadnought and power armor, hence \u201ctactical dreadnought armor\u201d. So no one \u201cuses terminator armor just as though they were using power armor\u201d.  Ryan Brewis .  Student at Borders College (2016-present) . 21w ago. None. It's literally impossible to operate wearing Terminator plate in the same way to operate in Mk VI, VII or VIII power armour. The point of Terminator armour is that it\u2019s big, it\u2019s heavy and it's tough. For this added protection you are slower and when you start running you aren't stopping or turning corners quickly.  Callum Firth . 20w ago. Well, if we take Dawn of War III as canon, then Gabriel Angelos is capable of wearing Terminator Armour and use it like he wasn\u2019t wearing a damn thing at all. He can do a flip in it for Pete\u2019s sake.

VQueens Park House is located in a heritage conservation area in Sydney's East, situated on a tree-lined street in a row of houses with similar facades. Even though the existing house did not have heritage status, Madeleine Blanchfield Architects sought to respect the larger context, which presented an interesting renovation dilemma. Per their website, "The challenge lay in concealing a large and contemporary two-story home behind part of a single-story federation frontage." . Their solution was inspired by the small cottage's roofline. "To respect the existing building, we adopted a folded roof form derived from the angles of the existing slate roof," say the architects. Doing so obscures the addition from the street, and has the added benefit of creating "a dramatic folded stair void" inside. . Now, faceted interior walls complement a simple oak staircase, and the stairwell connects the new addition to the remaining rooms of the old house. That contemporary approach was continued in the airy main living spaces. There, Belmondo gray marble floors are offset by black-framed glazing and a wall of kitchen cupboards fronted with New Age Veneer in Navurban Ravenswood finish. A Carrara marble counter, backsplash, and integrated shelf temper the dark cabinetry, as does the custom oak island. The architects further maintained consistency by continuing the kitchen wall treatment and flooring outside, and by repeating the oak and marble accents in other rooms. . Project Credits:.

VNEW DELHI (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. military\u2019s Pacific command called China a disruptive power in the Indo-Pacific region on Thursday and urged countries in the area to build capabilities and work together to ensure free and open seas. . Admiral Harry Harris, known for his combative views on Beijing\u2019s South China Sea expansion, was speaking at a security conference sponsored by the Indian government, where he was joined by the chief of staff, joint staff of Japan and the head of the Indian navy. . The three countries - the United States, Japan and India - have grown increasingly concerned about China\u2019s assertive military posture in the region and sought to draw closer, with Australia, in a \u201cquad\u201d of liberal democracies. . \u201cI believe the reality is that China is a disruptive transitional force in the Indo-Pacific, they are owner of the \u2018trust deficit\u2019 that we all have spent the last hour talking about,\u201d Harris said referring to the discussions of the panel. . The United States has criticized China\u2019s construction of islands and build-up of military facilities in the South China Sea, saying they could be used to restrict free nautical movement. . China says there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and opposes efforts to use it as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to infringe on China\u2019s sovereignty and security interests. . Harris said China\u2019s actions had cause disquiet in countries stretching from the Philippines to Malaysia and Vietnam. He said it was time countries took firmer measures to ensure maritime stability. . \u201cWe must be willing to take the tough decisions to ensure the Indo-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean remain free, open and prosperous,\u201d he said. \u201cThis requires like-minded nations to develop capacities, leverage each other\u2019s capabilities.\u201d . Harris had earlier proposed joint patrols with the Indian navy in the Indian Ocean. New Delhi, worried about a backlash from China, said no such actions were planned. . But India has begun holding trilateral naval exercises with the U.S. and Japan that military experts say could eventually include Australia as well. .

V Ian Clements .  See www.bladdercancerfight.blogspot.com/ . 106w ago. 'Cure' is a difficult concept for cancer, as it is thought that cancerous cells are arising all the time as part of the inevitable natural development of cells and in response to pollutant stress. Most such cells are dealt with naturally by the cells being non-viable and self-destructing; by the cells being attacked by the immune system successfully. Alas, for reasons we do not fully understand at the moment, occasionally such cells continue to develop and become life-threatening - effectively when we recognise them as cancers. At present most of these can be dealt with by surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. So much so that the number of cancer survivors have doubled in recent years, so for many cancer is a chronic condition rather than a death sentence - I am one of those. It is expected, and some new drugs have been successful already, in the near future that by either strengthening the immune system or removing the cancer cells ability to cloak itself from the immune system, all developed cancers (those that evade the bodies natural defences, could be successfully dealt with.  Natarajan Ganesan .  My Research Work - PhD, Post Doc and Beyond . 106w ago. The way I see you asking the question is can there be one treatment protocol for all types of cancer. . If so, theoretically yes. Are we there yet? The answer is no. If not, the answer again is theoretically yes. Each form would have it's own effective way protocol.

VThe only functioning airport in Libya's capital Tripoli remained shut for a third day on Wednesday after fierce clashes between armed groups damaged planes belonging to all four of the airlines that operate there.  The fighting erupted on Monday after one of the city's many armed groups launched an attack at Mitiga Airport in an apparent effort to secure the release of prisoners held in an adjacent prison. At least 20 people were killed and 60 wounded.  "Mitiga's air space remains closed and it is up to the authorities to decide when it will be reopened," the airport administration said in a short statement on Wednesday.  Petro Air, which operates flights to Libyan oil fields, also said all its flights at Mitiga were still suspended.  A number of planes parked there were damaged during the clashes, including an A319 Airbus belonging to Afriqiyah Airlines, an Airbus A330 operated by Libyan Airlines, two Boeings operated to Buraq Air, and two jets operated by Libya Wings.  Some aircraft were moved for safety reasons across the capital to Tripoli's international airport, which has been closed since 2014 due to damage from earlier fighting.

VA Turkish military transport plane on Wednesday crashed in southern Anatolia, claiming the lives of three army personnel on board, the Turkish army said in a statement. The plane, carrying two pilots and one technician, crashed in the southern Isparta province, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) said, offering condolences to the families of \u201cour heroic comrades\u201d who were killed \u201cas a result of a tragic accident.\u201d. The cause of the crash was not immediately known but local governor Sehmus Gunaydin told the state-run TRT television there was dense and thick fog in the region. \u201cWe are working to reach the wreck\u201d of the plane, he said. The CASA type plane took off from a base in western Anatolian province of Eskisehir at 0803 GMT and communication had been cut around 0950 GMT, and a search and rescue operation begun, the army said. In December last year, a Turkish fighter jet crashed near an airport in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir but the pilot was able to safely eject from the plane.

V Jeanmarie Todd .  former keeper of chickens at Kind Food Farm. . 229w ago. Largely GMO soy, GMO corn, and GMO wheat, with perhaps other grains mixed in, depending on their availability and price. But those are the big three. According to what I've read. I buy soy-free organic layer pellets from Modesto Milling, but that's not all my birds eat. First, they forage for themselves on our farm all day. They get a few kitchen scraps and sometimes have access to our compost pile, and I sprout seeds for them daily. Here's the list of ingredients for the pellets, which though not ideal (I'd prefer to feed a greater variety of whole grains that I've sprouted, but it's time-consuming and perhaps costly to source everything), is the best I can find locally right now:. Ingredients: Organic corn, organic canola meal, organic wheat, organic peas, limestone, organic sun-dried alfalfa, moncalcium phosphate, Redmond Conditioner (clay), organic flaxseed, diatomaceous earth, organic kelp meal, Redmond Sea Salt, DL methionine, poultry vitamin & mineral premix, organic garlic granules, organic horseradish powder, organic star anise oil, organic juniper berry oil. Here's the list from Modesto Milling's "regular" organic layer pellets:. Ingredients :Organic corn, organic soybean meal, organic wheat, limestone, organic sun-dried alfalfa, organic flaxseed, Redmond conditioner (clay), organic wheat millrun, organic kelp meal, monocalcium phosphate, diatomaceous earth, Redmond salt, DL Methionine, poultry vitamin & mineral premix, organic garlic granules, organic horseradish powder, organic star anise oil, organic juniper berry oil. I searched for the complete ingredients list for Purina's "Layena" layer pellets. They give you marketing copy, but no actual ingredients list. What does that tell you?.  Mary . 60w ago. Chicken diets are primarily made up of macro ingredients such as cereal grains (example wheat, barley and sorghum) and oil seed meals (such as soya bean or canola meal) or animal by-product meals.

VMôrelig, situated at the foot of the Paardeberg in the Swartland, counts the likes of Lammershoek and Adi Badenhorst\u2019s Kalmoesfontein as neighbours so Andrew Wightman was probably not entirely misguided when he acquired the property in 2011 and started producing wine under his own label in 2015. Tasting notes and ratings for the current-release 2017s as follows:. Môrelig Chenin Blanc 2017.  Price: R110.  Alc: 13%. Spontaneously fermented and matured for nine months in old oak. A floral top note before orange, apricot, yellow peach, ginger and other spice, all subtle and alluring. The palate shows good fruit expression and moderate acidity before a nicely savoury finish. Modest in the best sense. Editor\u2019s rating: 89/100. Môrelig Old Bushvine Chenin Blanc 2017.  Price: R170.  Alc: 12.78%. From a block planted in 1980. Spontaneously fermented and matured for nine months in old oak. Lemon, white peach, apple cider, dried herbs and just a hint of flinty reduction on the nose. The palate shows concentrated fruit and plenty of drive (although TA is relatively low at 5.02g/l) before a pithy finish. Very striking and rather delicious. Editor\u2019s rating: 92/100. Neatly trimmed. Môrelig The Hedge 2017.  Price: R130.  Alc: 12.35%. 75% Syrah, 13% Carignan and 12% bought-in Cinsault. Very aromatic with notes of red and black berries, fynbos, purple flowers, olive tapenade, spice and a hint of earth. The palate is marked by surprisingly plump fruit, fresh acidity and powdery tannins, the finish gently savoury. A most accomplished maiden release. Editor\u2019s rating: 94/100.

VPresident Trump and Republican leaders at retreat at Camp David, Md., earlier this month.  Lisa MascaroContact Reporter . House Republicans unveiled a stopgap measure to avert a looming government shutdown, but passage is uncertain because the bill fails to include action on the Dream Act to protect young immigrants from deportation. The bill would keep the government running past Friday\u2019s deadline for four more weeks, through Feb. 16, but Democrats are likely to reject the measure without a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Trump is ending this year. Instead, GOP leaders are relying on their majority to pass the bill through the House, and put pressure on Senate Democrats not to block it. Republicans hold only a narrow Senate majority and they must rely on Democrats to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster for passage. The measure would include a mix of provisions that will likely attract some votes even as they push others away. One is a reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance program for six years, which is important to Democrats. Others include a two-year repeal of Affordable Care Act taxes on medical device makers, and a tax on employees\u2019 high-priced health benefits, the so-called Cadillac tax, that some Democrats also want to end. The GOP measure does not include disaster aid, which is important to members of both parties but has stalled in the Senate. But even House approval was uncertain after Tuesday\u2019s closed-door meeting left rank-and-file lawmakers uneasy over punting the spending bill for the third time this fiscal year. Some Republicans also want a DACA fix, and plan to oppose the bill unless it has one. Conservatives meanwhile objected to running the government on autopilot, without more spending cuts. \u201cWe know this is going to come down to just a few Republican votes,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, after the closed-door GOP meeting. "The number of Freedom Caucus members that are undecided could make the difference whether we pass it or not.\u201d. A House vote is expected Thursday. Copyright © 2018, Los Angeles Times.

VChukwudi Dumeme Onuamadike (Evans) speaking to journalists when he was paraded by the Nigerian Police. A Lagos Division of the Federal High Court on Tuesday dismissed the N300 million fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by alleged billionaire kidnapper, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, otherwise known as Evans. The judge, Abdulaziz Anka, dismissed the suit for lacking merit. The alleged notorious kidnapper had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and kidnapping before a judge but later changed his plea to 'not guilty.'. Evans had dragged the Inspector-General of Police, the Nigeria Police Force, Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, and Special Anti-Robbery Squad before the court for alleged illegal detention. The alleged kidnapper, through his lawyer, Olukoya Ogungbeje, claimed that his prolonged detention in police custody was a violation of his fundamental human rights. He also accused the police of subjecting him to a media trial. But the police had responded that they obtained a court order to detain the suspect for 90 days for proper investigation. Delivering his judgment on the suit, Mr. Anka said the police's decision to detain Evans was reasonable since the police had shown they had an order to detain him for 90 days. On the allegation of subjecting the suspect to a media trial, the judge said no law stops the media from carrying out their constitutional duty. "This case does not succeed and is accordingly dismissed. All parties have the right of appeal," Mr. Anka said.

VThe first and most important thing that you must do is love them. It can be terrifying. It's difficult, it's different, but it isn't something you are incapable of. Watching someone you love struggle with that ominous feeling of the weight of the world on their shoulders is painful, and it's often challenging to recognize what you can do to help them. . The first and most important thing that you must do is love them. Love them through what they are going through. Let them know that their worth is not conditional. Show them that their insecurities do not define them, show them that in their struggle they are not alone. You have to become patient with what you may not easily understand, as challenging as this may be. Through their tears, you must reassure them that there is so much purpose surpassing the moment at hand. It's extremely difficult for someone struggling with depression to see past the current horizon. It feels like looking at a sunset and believing that there is nothing beyond what you can see. For some, this is easier to understand than it is for others, but for someone who is depressed, this is a recurring, often agonizing reality. Encourage the struggling people that you love that there is always more than we can see, always more than we can feel at one moment. Each day we are able to experience millions of different feelings and thoughts. Each day we are offered a plethora of new opportunities. . If this struggling person is you, try your hardest to do the same for yourself. I know that this is easier said than done. It's one thing to love those that you care about who struggle with depression, but it is a totally different story when the person you need to care for is yourself. It's more challenging because we often look at our own flaws under an intense amount of scrutiny, like we are examining them under a microscope, being sure not to miss even one. This being said, try to show yourself the grace and love that you strive to show those that you care about. Recognize that with every shortcoming, every imperfection, you are worthy of the love that you give. .

V Allen Williams .  Manager Product Operations, Facebook . 315w ago. During winter, snow sports are certainly the main activity for Vancouverites, however there are a few events and somewhat warmer options:. Chinese New Year Parade & Festival - January 29, 2012. Dine-Out Vancouver: annual 17 day event of food events and special menus hosted by hundreds of restaurants, runs January 20-February 5, 2012; hotels may offer special packages during this event. Ice Skating: in the heart of downtown, Robson Square offers a nice ice skating rink (free) December through February. Granville Island: an amazing indoor market of specialty foods, food vendors etc. which is surrounded by various artisan shops on the island. Of course, there is always the aquarium, modern art museum, anthropology museum, Bloedel Floral Conservatory, world of science museum. Although Christmas is now gone, here are some good December options:. VanDusen Botanical Gardens Festival of Lights: during December, the gardens are transformed into an amazing light display. Capilano Suspension Bridge Canyon Lights: during December, walk a lengthly suspension bridge at night and tour the grounds which are lit with christmas lights. Stanley Park Bright Lights: during December, take a train ride through the park which is transformed by millions of twinkling lights.

V David B. Chalpin .  M.D., ABR-certified in Diagnostic Radiology . 110w ago. You asked: How does mind reading through MRI scanning work?. This question cannot even have an answer to it without your clarifying what you mean by "mind reading"? Do you mean reading a subject's thoughts? Do you mean seeing what portions of the subject's brain are activated by a paradigm presented to the patient?. Once you determine the above, you'll need to look up the term "paradigm" as well as the topic of Functional MRI. In the brain, the primary technique employed for this purpose goes by the acronym B.O.L.D. I hope this answer helps to guide you in your serious endeavor to understand the science of mind-reading. --------------------------------------------------. You have now qualified your question with the statement: "i.e. how does one create visual representations of a person's thoughts through MRI scanning.". So you ARE referring to thoughts! At this time (and in my opinion, for quite some time,) MRI does not create images of someone's thoughts. It can, depending on the paradigm employed, demonstrate areas of the brain which become activated, i.e. receive an extra amount of Oxygen. So at best, it can be used to show one (of presumably several) aspect of a thought. IF this mechanism I just outlined for you as to HOW functional MRI (abbreviated fMRI) works intrigues you, I recommend you review the last paragraph of my initial answer to your question. .  Nitish Katoch .  PhD candidate in Biomedical engg. . 109w ago.  Well, question seems to be very elementary. Its one of the impossible thing to do till now. whether we can is which part of the brain is mostly acting thrroughout your thinking process. Functional Magnetic resonance imaging is very much effective to do so. whether we have BOLD imaging,and now a days conductivity images is very much effective to do so. .

VA gang of robbers that had been pulling people over on the N12 motorway using a blue light and impersonating police officers are all three in cuffs. The trio who were known to follow people from the OR Tambo Airport targeting travellers this morning followed two vehicles from the airport area and pulled them over near the Comaro N12 motorway offramp. The foreigners from Mozambique who were travelling in a silver Hilux Bakkie and HiAce minibus were robbed of cash and cellphones. MB10 a CPF community patroller from Mondeor Sector 1 SAPS area witnessed the robbery and followed the suspects driving a white Toyota Etios vehicle. Backup was arranged from CPF members from Mondeor and Booysens, JMPD, Mondeor SAPS, Booysens SAPS, JHB Flying squad and saps helicopter. MB10 pursued them into Haddon where all three were arrested by CPF members, JMPD and SAPS. This arrest was possible because of information sharing. If people did not share their experiences with this gang on social media there would have been little awareness. \u201cI congratulate MB10 on exceptional bravery and ability and thank all those that offered support from CPF members from all areas, JMPD and SAPS. With a partnership like this between community and law enforcement we will win the war on crime in our area.\u201d. Mondeor SAPS are with the complainants now and a case of robbery with firearm and impersonating SAPS members is being opened against the suspects. An official statement will follow from the police.

VHi, everyone. My name is Constanza Andrea Fuentes Ojeda; I\u2019m into surrealist-oneiric art (which contains a glum touch) since I was 16. It was a bit hard at first because I fell for art only by expressing myself and everything was fully connected to my feelings and to the internal pain I felt by that time, in fact, I didn\u2019t reveal my real name and I used to call myself LOS, because I didn\u2019t want anybody to realize that it was me. Today, I\u2019m 21 and I\u2019m able to say openly who I am: Coni Fuentes, the person who knew art as a way of channeling her internal conflicts. This project became a wonderful and indescribable passion because of everything that I\u2019ve experienced in my life and it opened the gates of my mind to depict in paper sheets those little pieces of emotions that affect me, which shape into unimaginable forms. Now, I want you to know my own world, because even though it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s full of infinite possibilities. You only need to hear it and observe it carefully because I honestly want you to know there\u2019s something else beyond what you\u2019re able to see: dreams, strange creatures, games or nightmares; deep concepts, magical places plus thousands of extravagant and disproportionate things you\u2019ll find in my art. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank anyone who takes time to read and know more about my universe, which for many people is imaginary but to me, it\u2019s real.

V Micci Lopez .  Perpetual student of marketing, currently with a digital marketing firm . 148w ago. Very broad inquiry but will try to answer as best I can. Depends on what you want to achieve from this. Essentially, there are 3 parts in project management: Pre, during and post. I would suggest that you create an outline and mark down which important parts you want to address. Generally though, if you want to follow the major parts, I would suggest these 3 topics:. 1. How to plan and organize a project. 2. How to efficiently and effectively implement a project. 3. What are the KPI's for a particular project and metrics to ensure success?.  Chuck Cobb .  Agile Project Management Author, Mentor, and Instructor . 95w ago. The impact of Agile on project management. Many people think of "project management" in a narrow sense as limited to a traditional plan-driven approach to project management. Many of those basic notions of what "project management" is have not significantly changed since the 1950's and 1960's and Agile will force us to rethink that in broader terms that include an Agile/adaptive approach to project management. PMI has taken a step in that direction by recognizing "Agile" as a legitimate form of project management; however, "Agile" and traditional plan-driven project management are still essentially treated as separate and independent domains of knowledge with little or no integration between the two. Chuck Cobb. Author of "The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile". Check out my free online training at http://agileprojectmanagementaca...  Balaji Chandrasekhar .  Mechatronics and Instrumentation engineer with project experience . 114w ago.  I am thinking about project management topics mainly production optimization related to automotive supplier companies . .

VThe Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA), in Kebbi, has engaged 800 unemployed youths in its Vegetation and Silt Control programme, an intervention to maintain roads and reduce accidents in the state.

VSubscription billing, also referred to as recurring billing, happens when a merchant automatically charges a cardholder for specified products or services on a prearranged schedule. A subscription-based billing system can bring your business several benefits that you don\u2019t have with the traditional way of receiving payments. Written in collaboration with PayU, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading online payment solutions providers, here are some of those advantages. Convenience and regularity.  The subscription-based billing system not only offers convenience but also predictability. The biggest benefit for businesses who offer subscriptions is that they can enjoy regular recurring income. For customers, subscription services allow them to pay for the products and services they use with one flat rate. For every subscription service a customer subscribes to, they have one less thing to worry about, which is convenient. Subscription billing also makes it possible for customers to budget more precisely, as flat fees are predictable and easy to include into a regular spending budget. Customer retention.  One of the most time-consuming tasks for any business, which often also requires spending more money, is tracking down new clients and increasing the revenue base. Subscriptions encourage customer retention, thus a subscription-based billing system is an easy way to retain customers. Multiple payment gateways.  According to Invoicera who are invoicing system specialists, a subscription-based billing system offers you an extensive range of online payment solutions to choose from. You can select the leading and the most affordable payment systems. You can save on transaction charges by selecting payment gateways with lower rates. Creating a built-in marketing base.  Having a subscription-based business model makes it easy to market to your existing customer base. Email is still considered one of the most effective marketing channels today. To get new customers you can easily encourage your existing customers to refer people they know without much effort from your side. . By moving to a subscription-based billing system, your business may be able to generate more regular recurring revenue, propelling it into an advantage over competitors still concentrating only on a point-of-sale strategy.
