V The unsuccessful launch of navigation satellite IRNSS-1H hasnt dented the spirit of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) as the space agency has its sights on launching a remote sensing satellite of Cartosat-2 series along with 30 nano satellites of foreign countries in the second half of December. Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) director Dr K Sivan said, \u201cIsro will be busy in launching a series of satellites from December onwards. We are targeting to launch Cartosat along with 30 nano satellites of foreign countries in the second half of December.\u201d. He said, \u201cThe replacement satellite for IRNSS-1A (the first navigation satellite whose three atomic clocks, meant to provide precise locational data, had stopped working last year) will be launched soon thereafter. . Both these launches will be from the first launchpad at Sriharikota as the second launchpad will be busy in launching three GSLV rockets, including the Chandrayaan-2 mission in March. \u201cIf for any reason, Cartosat launch is delayed in December, it will also stall the launch of replacement satellite IRNSS-1I as both these launches have been planned from the first launchpad.\u201d. The three GSLV launches, which will involve two GSLV Mk II and one GSLV Mk III (Isro\u2019s fat boy), will be from the second launchpad at Sriharikota. Instead of PSLV (which was used for launching Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008), Isro is using GSLV Mk II for the second lunar mission as the payload is heavier this time (combined launch mass 3,250 kg). The payload will constitute orbiter, lander and rover. .

V Mangalore Today News Network. Bengaluru, Oct 23, 2017 : Amid a heated debate on Tipu Sultan\u2019s birthday celebrations, an old photo of former chief minister and senior BJP leader Jagadish Shettar dressed as Tipu Sultan has gone viral on social media. Former Deputy chief minister R Ashoka and former Lok Sabha member D B Chandre Gowda are also seen wearing the headgear in the viral photos. In his response, Shettar said the photo was not from Tipu Jayanti celebrations. "It was from an award ceremony of the party\u2019s minority morcha, where we were given headgears and swords," he said. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has said Shettar had written a foreword to a book praising the valour of Tipu. Shettar had called Tipu a patriot in a book written by historian Sheikh Ali. Many BJP leaders, including Union Minister Ananth Kumar Hegde, had refused to join the birthday celebrations of Tipu Sultan, terming him \u201canti-Hindu and anti-Kannada.\u201d. BJP general secretary and MP Shobha Karandlaje said the party will launch a protest if the government goes ahead with the celebrations. \u201cThere is no need to include the names of BJP leaders in the invitation on the pretext of following protocol. The government is spreading communal hatred by repeatedly organising Tipu Jayanti." Shobha said. The Siddaramaiah government has decided to celebrate Tipu Jayanti on November 10, when the BJP is planning to call a statewide protest against the \u2019minority appeasement\u2019 politics. courtesy:DHNS.

V The flood situation worsened in some parts of Manipur with torrential rain flooding more villages and paddy fields and the Iril river flowing above the danger mark on Monday.  Villagers said that though the rain had stopped in the valley districts there is still heavy downpour in the hill areas from where all the rivers originate.  Some villages at Naharup in Imphal east district and Urup and Arabati in Thoubal district were inundated along with some paddy fields.  Angry villagers said that no official and local legislators visited them. They elevated and strengthened the river banks using their own resources to check overflowing.  The main streets in the city areas at Sagolband and Uripok in Imphal west district are also flooded.  Farmers said they were hoping that after the floods there would be a bountful harvest. But they are now afraid that the verdant paddy fields will be destroyed by the current spell of rain.  They also said that they have not received any assistance from the government although the Central government had sanctioned money for flood victims in the northeast.  Chief Minister N. Biren Singh had announced soon after the July floods that the government will distribute quick yielding paddy plants. The farmers said that they are yet to get the plants.  The torrential rain started in the valley areas on Saturday morning.  --IANS il/him/bg. ( 234 Words).

VBesides its Pulsar range witnessing highest ever numbers, the Pune-based manufacturer has also recorded maximum monthly sales last month. Bajaj Auto has recently announced its performance figures for the second quarter of the current financial year. During the said period, the Pune based manufacturer sold a total of 5.83 lakh units of motorcycles in India thereby, registering an impressive growth of 37 percent in comparison to the same quarter last year. Not only this, Bajaj Auto also recorded its highest ever monthly sales of 4.28 lakh units in the month of September 2017. Now, coming to the interesting part, the company\u2019s Pulsar range clocked best ever monthly sales of 1.12 lakh units that include both domestic sales and exports. When combined with Avenger and Dominar brands, the three registered a total sale of 2.37 lakh units in the second quarter. During this period, the company\u2019s NS range that comprises of the NS 160 and NS 200 accounted for a sale of 42,000 units during the quarter. Talking of September only, the Pulsar, Dominar and Avenger brands managed to clock a total sale of 98,601 units. Talking of market share, Bajaj Auto captures 19.5 percent in September while in Q2 overall, it was 17 percent. For those not in the know, Bajaj Auto has partnered with Triumph Motorcycles to manufacture middle weight bikes in India. While the designing and development part will be on the shoulders of the British manufacturer, the sales network will be handled by Bajaj. The first product out of this alliance is expected to hit markets by the end of the year 2019. In order to build cost competitive products under the partnership, Bajaj Auto is even planning to build a separate factory near its existing plant at Chakan near Pune. At present, Royal Enfield is ruling the mid capacity motorcycle segment with sales averaging around 55,000 to 60,000 units a month. Bajaj Auto tried to create ripples in the said segment with the launch of Dominar 400 last year but has not managed to do so.

V Mankind has long been fascinated by the future. So it makes sense that this past week's top stories were all about cars, trucks, and SUVs that won't be hitting the market until the 2019 model year. And right at the top of the list is the Ram 1500. We've come to know Ram as the truck maker that styles its pickups with cues cribbed from big rigs, but that look has slowly evolved over time into something uniquely its own. The next Ram 1500 continues this trend, with a newly refined look that we can't wait to see in person.  Up next is the 2019 Chevy Silverado. Pickup trucks have been, continue to be, and will remain the best-selling vehicles in America. And General Motors is a leader in the field, with two distinct offerings with which to entice buyers, one from the bread-and-butter Chevrolet brand and one wearing the slightly more upscale GMC badge. The Chevy looks to get LED lighting elements for 2019, which ought to keep the truck from looking dated when compared to the Ford F-150 and the previously mentioned Ram 1500.  From there we move past pickup trucks and into SUVs and sedans. The 2019 Jeep Cherokee looks to get toned down a bit with its next refresh, and the '19 BMW 3 Series continues its slow evolutionary journey at the top of its aspirational sales pedestal.  Finally, spy shots give way to official production reveals for the 2019 Audi A7 and Polestar 1. This pair of European luxury cars won't compete with one another \u2013 one is a rakish hatchback and the other a sports coupe \u2013 any further than for the eyeballs of our readers, but both proved popular enough to merit inclusion in our weekly roundup.  As always, tune in to Autoblog next week for a front-row seat to all the happenings worth following in the automotive industry.

VNew Delhi, Oct 23 (PTI) Tired of his canvas, his brushes and his studio, renowned painter Sanjay Bhattacharya decided to go on a trip across India. He said he was looking for \u201cinner peace\u201d, and found it eventually as he discovered his love for another medium of art \u2014 photography, after having painted for over a decade. Bhattacharya, who clicked as many as 1,000 pictures on multiple journeys, recently showcased a collection of 16 photographs in an exhibition titled, \u201cNa Mono Lagena\u201d (The Detached Mind) at the Visual Arts gallery here. \u201cMy tryst with the camera happened when I was bored of my usual routine. Going through the same routine, witnessing the ups and down of art market, fulfilling deadlines, made me feel like a soul confined within the four walls. \u201cI pick up the camera when I am tired of the world and I go on a journey in search for inner peace,\u201d he said. The exhibition named after music composer Salil Chaudhary\u2019s famous song unravels the artist\u2019s quest for solitude as he explores the dynamics of nature and the cultural fabric of India. \u201cI am not a great photographer. My mind doesn\u2019t settle at one place, rather keeps on exploring to find the next source of inspiration. What began as a practice of merely clicking photographs at family gatherings, soon graduated to an epiphanic moment when he realised that that was not enough. \u201cNow, I wanted to explore different places in India,\u201d he said. From the numerous photographs clicked in Ladakh, he chose to exhibit two \u2014 \u2018Silence I\u2019 and \u2018Silence II\u2019, capturing the magnificence of the snow-capped mountains in the cold desert. \u201cLadakh is about different colours at different times of the day depending on the light,\u201d he said. \u201cKrishna \u2013 the flute player\u201d, showcases an image of a small statue of Lord Krishna captured in beautiful light to create a shadow, symbolic of the God that embraces one\u2019s inner being. Nature\u2019s beauty comes alive in his photographs clicked in Santiniketan in West Bengal, which largely feature \u201cnameless\u201d ponds in the quaint town in Bolpur. Bhattacharya said he turned to everything and anything for inspiration. Sometimes he finds meaning in something as mundane as utensils, at other instances, he highlights the different ethnic and cultural identities of the Indian people. The show was on display till October 15.

VBilkis Bano, the victim of the gang rape during the Gujarat riots, interacts with media at a press conference in New Delhi. (PTI: File Photo). The Supreme Court has allowed Bilkis Bano to file a separate plea seeking enhancement of compensation awarded to her by lower courts. The apex court also asked the Gujarat government if any departmental action has been taken against cops convicted in the gangrape case. The murder of the family members of 19-year-old Bilkis Bano and her gangrape was one of the most horrendous episodes of the 2002 Godhra riots. On March 3, the five months pregnant Bilkis was escaping a mob along with 17 others on a truck. An armed mob consisting of 35 people attacked the truck and killed 14 of her family members, including her two-year-old daughter. When Bilkis approached the local police station after the massacre, they refused to lodge a complaint and intimidated her. She then approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and petitioned the Supreme Court. The apex court then directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the case. . Though the trial began in Ahmedabad in 2003, the Supreme Court shifted it to Mumbai in 2004 after Bilkis and her family started receiving life threats in Gujarat. The Mumbai court ordered filing of charges against 19 accused, including six police officers and a government doctor. In 2008, 11 of them were given life imprisonment. The CBI demanded death penalty for three arguing that the depraved act of gangraping a pregnant woman and multiple murders, including an infant and a toddler, amounted to the rarest of rare case. The Supreme court, however, dismissed the appeal by the CBI. (with inputs from PTI).

VSRINAGAR: Rehmatullah, a meritorious student and \u201cthe only one in a nine-member family who had a deep interest in studies\u201d, has lost 14 months of his youth in jail for being \u201ca threat to the security of the state and maintenance of public order.\u201d Arrested in August 2016, he has been twice booked under the draconian Public Safety Act (PSA) and confined at Kot Balwal Jail.  Fayaz Ahmad, his brother, told Kashmir Reader that police took Rehmatullah under custody on a Friday in August. He was subsequently booked under PSA and sent to jail the same day.  \u201cHe was never released after that,\u201d Fayaz said. \u201cWe pleaded before both the government and the court, but to no avail.\u201d.  Resident of a far-flung area in Doda, Rehmatullah had been an \u201cintelligent and meritorious\u201d student throughout his career, Fayaz said. In Class 10, he secured 426 marks out of 500, and in Class 12 scored more than 90%, said Dawood, Rehmatullah\u2019s close friend. He also won a scholarship from 8th to 12th standard, Dawood added.  Fayaz said his brother was the only one in their nine-member family who had a deep interest in studies. After him, his youngest sister is pursuing higher studies. Rest of his two brothers have studied up to Class 12 while the sisters have not studied beyond Class 10, Fayaz said.  \u201cHe is our hope. We believe he will take us out from despair to light. Though he has lost 14 months, we will support him in continuing with higher studies,\u201d Fayaz said.  Rehmatullah\u2019s studies have been supported by his father, who earns by selling different commodities on a kiosk, and by Fayaz, who sells readymade garments.  According to Fayaz, Rehmatullah was sent to a good school in Shopian where he had qualified an exam to earn a scholarship.  \u201cHe was never involved in any (anti-government) activity. He had no previous FIR, no police record,\u201d Fayaz said. \u201cThis is the reason why police have not correctly named his parentage in their FIR. His father\u2019s name is Abdul Gani, but the FIR names him as Abdul Rasheed.\u201d.  Education Minister Altaf Bukhari said that he will get the boy released soon. \u201cI have been working on his case for some time. I will get him released in two weeks,\u201d he said.

VIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens to the data Google collects via Chrome, today\u2019s announcement gives you something of an idea. The newly unveiled Chrome User Experience Report is a collection of data from users who have opted in to usage statistic reporting, the idea being that developers will be able to see how users experience the websites they visit. Google launched the new tool at the Chrome Dev Summit 2017 in San Francisco, and at the same time also announced Trusted Web Activity. This is essentially a way to provide app-like behavior in Chrome to create a more cohesive experience. Google explains that Chrome User Data Report provides \u201cinsight into comparisons with other sites [and] macro user experience trends across the web.\u201d The initial dataset is built from 10,000 samples, with the focus being on loading metrics. In future, the metrics will be expanded to other areas so it will be more useful to developers looking to improve their sites. Announcing the launch of the Chrome User Experience Report, Google says:. By querying the dataset, developers can understand how real Chrome users experience the web from the diverse set of hardware, software, and networks they use in the wild. Analyzing many origins on the web will help site developers and the web community understand where they are doing well, identify areas for improvement, and observe advancements in user experience over time. You can find out more on the Chrome User Experience Report page. Trusted Web Activity will make its way to the Developer and Canary builds of Chrome very soon, and the \u201capp-in-a-browser-tab\u201d experience will also be coming to other browsers thanks to APIs in the Android support library.

VThe idea, mooted by group of young CEOs at a recent Niti Aayog event, has found favour with the tourism ministry, which has started talks with the ministry of external affairs to work out the modalities.  Foreigners may get to pay a lower visa fee for vacations in India during the lean season, with the government considering concessions aimed at making the country a year-round destination for tourists from all over the world. .  The idea, mooted by group of young CEOs at a recent Niti Aayog event, has found favour with the tourism ministry, which has started talks with the ministry of external affairs to work out the modalities after Prime Minister Narendra Modi evinced interest in such an out-of-the-box idea to boost tourism in the country. .  The peak season for international tourists in India is from October to March, when travellers from the US, Bangladesh, the UK, Sri Lanka, Russia and Canada throng India in large numbers. .  Foreign tourist arrivals in India dips in the non-peak season because of the extreme summer temperatures. .  About 3.66 million foreigners visited India in the April-September period in 2016, which accounted for 42% of the total of 8.8 million last year, according to data on the tourism ministry website. .  The tourism ministry wants to promote destinations in India that can be visited in all seasons and year-round inflow of tourists will boost the creation of jobs and growth in the sector, a senior government official told ET. .  \u201cConcessional visa fees for nonpeak season is required to give initial push to the sector,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity. \u201cHowever, this could come with some riders and would be initially for a short period.\u201d .  The cost of a six-month multiple entry Indian tourist visa ranges from $32 for Singaporean nationals to over $67 for US citizens and over $137 for citizens of the UK. .  Foreign tourist arrivals in India during January-September this year grew 15.5% to 7.12 million from a year earlier. .  \u201cPeople from the Middle East may find the Himalayas cool enough for a vacation. Hence, we need to make it attractive enough for people to explore India throughout the year,\u201d the official said. .  Under its \u2018Champions of Change\u2019 initiative held in August, Niti Aayog had invited 200 young CEOs for an informal interaction with the Prime Minister. .  They were divided into six groups, each dealing with a challenge for the country\u2019s policy makers. These included doubling farmers\u2019 incomes, creating cities of tomorrow, Make in India, reforming the financial sector, worldclass infrastructure and New India-2022. .

VVictoria Beckham is fashion and beauty royalty. Her runway fashions are worn by the Hollywood elite. Estee Lauder recruited her for a wildly successful makeup collaboration. And let\u2019s not forget her status as a pop culture icon alongside the Spice Girls. With this many accomplishments and a sizable income to her name, one might assume her personal beauty stash includes items that cost more than our rent\u2026and it does. But, there are also a few bargains sprinkled throughout her daily routine. According to a recent interview with Into The Gloss, the 43-year-old swears by Bioderma Sensibio H2O Wipes for makeup removal. Yes, the pink ones you always pass in the drugstore aisle. \u201cThe only face wipes that actually take off all my makeup are the Bioderma ones,\u201d she shared. \u201cI always use a cleanser after, but these wipes really get everything off.\u201d. It\u2019s also important to note that her cleansing steps don\u2019t start and end with wipes. Most of us, especially after a long day, tend to wipe off our makeup and jump right in the bed, not realizing our skin needs a little more love. However, the Bioderma wipes are a great place to start. Bioderma. They\u2019re fragrance-free and infused with a micellar water solution that mimic the cells used to naturally rebuild our skin\u2019s film. In simpler terms: it will remove makeup without completely disturbing your skin\u2019s ability to repair itself. Beckham\u2019s drugstore go-to just became our new obsession. Ah, the stars; they\u2019re just like us (kind of).

VA girl's got to look good when she goes home for the holidays, but you can't exactly stuff your whole vanity into a weekender bag. This might be a problem if your go-to palette is sunset-themed Desert Dusk ($65) from Huda Beauty, as the 18-pan beauty isn't what we'd call "portable." Luckily, Huda Kattan went and solved that problem for us with her upcoming Mini Obsession Palettes. Not only do these four shades come in sleek, stashable packaging, but at $27 each, the palettes are less than half the price of the Mama Bear offering. . Huda revealed Mini Obsessions on Snapchat and was quick to clarify that the shadows themselves are full-size. The product has been fit into a smaller case \u2014 and, luckily, its mirror looks pretty large. Huda called the bundles a combination of "all the most essential colors, in one place.".  Huda Beauty Mini Obsessions Eye Shadow Palette . The four options are Smoky, Electric, Mauve, and Warm Brown. Huda said her favorite is Smoky, which features an absolutely gorgeous shimmering rose gold.  Huda Beauty Mini Obsessions Eye Shadow Palette . I'm partial to Electric (pictured), which is a departure from the cool, sandy colors Huda is known and loved for. This baby includes a breathtaking metallic sea green that I need painted on my eyes, like, yesterday.  Huda Beauty Mini Obsessions Eye Shadow Palette . Each of these palettes include nine shades, which is pretty impressive, since it feels like many minis only deliver four or six hues a pop.  Huda Beauty Winter Solstice Highlighter Palette . Also included in Huda's holiday lineup is the (full-sized) Winter Solstice Highlighter Palette. This is looks like an icier version of her Summer Solstice ($45) release, but Huda said it touts a brand new formula. Image Source: Snapchat user hudabeauty.  Huda Beauty Winter Solstice Highlighter Palette . Huda wrote that she worked in the lab to redevelop the pre-existing Solstice powders to be as "soft and buttery" as possible. Just one look at the pigmented white gold on her ring finger is enough to give this $45 release need-right-now status. Image Source: Snapchat user hudabeauty.  Huda Beauty Winter Solstice Highlighter Palette . This celestial-embossed palette will launch on Oct. 27 at Sephora and ShopHudaBeauty.com. Image Source: Huda Beauty.  Huda Beauty Winter Solstice Highlighter Palette . The Mini Obsessions Palettes will drop on Nov. 1. Consider it an early holiday gift to yourself. Image Source: Huda Beauty.

V There are a lot of Samsung fans that don\u2019t like the idea of a fingerprint sensor at the back. They were vocal in their criticism of the move when Samsung decided to relocate the Galaxy S8\u2019s fingerprint sensor to the back. It did the same thing with the Galaxy Note 8 as well. However, if a new patent application by Samsung is anything to go by, the company might switch back to a front-mounted fingerprint sensor for the Galaxy S9. The Galaxy S9 isn\u2019t due until the first quarter of next year so there\u2019s a lot of time before we can be sure about what to expect from this device. Nothing is set in stone so far.  Advertisement. Article continues below . Samsung has filed for a patent with the South Korean authority Kipris. The patent filing details a small depression, basically a notch, at the bottom on the front of the device where a fingerprint sensor would be housed. Inside the notch, there will be a super-fast fingerprint sensor. The notch itself would be small to ensure that the display remains bezel-less. Samsung has long been rumored to be working on optical fingerprint recognition technology which would enable the company to place the fingerprint sensor inside the display itself. However, the technology is reportedly not ready yet, so this might be the second-best solution that Samsung has to restore the fingerprint sensor to its former glory, as some would suggest.

It also claimed money was being used to "try and uproot" the Sena. "Even if people face recession after demonetisation, one party is on an upturn and came to power in Goa and Manipur despite being rejected by the people," an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.

It\u2019s drier than young skin, even this does not feel like it, considering the fact that oil glands do not produce exactly the same amount of oil merely because they used to.

Moisturizers that contain sweet almond oil are allowed to be very effective, and in fact, using sweet almond oil entirely on older skin can make it look ten years younger.

VBelying the government's avowed push for less oil consumption, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, the Indian arm of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp, has halted the production of its hybrid Camry as sales declined a steep 73 per cent after tax incidence on the cars hit 43 per cent under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. The Camry production line at Toyota Kirloskar's manufacturing site on the outskirts of Bengaluru has ground to a halt because the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the attendant cess have made it too costly, the company said. With the change in tax structure, the parent company's plans to introduce a wide range of hybrids in India have also been shelved. The assembly line was producing only the hybrid variant of the Camry due to high demand, but sales slumped after the price surged on imposition of 28 per cent GST plus the 15 per cent cess for luxury cars. This meant the ex-showroom price of the car in Delhi, which accounted for half its sales, rose to about Rs38 lakh from Rs32 lakh. Toyota stopped production at the end of the September quarter after the hybrid's sales dropped 73 per cent during the period from a year earlier, according to a Times of India report citing figures provided by the company. The Japanese automaker had launched the Camry assembly facility five years ago and stopped making the regular version of the car given demand for the hybrid. Sales haven't completely dried up as the company has some inventory left over from before the stoppage. The company said it has invested Rs15 crore in the Camry hybrid facility in addition to Rs24 crore on training, campaigns and service. "We don't have a business case to persuade our parent company in Japan to step up investments on hybrids in Bengaluru, given the punitive tax structure," said Shekar Viswanathan, vice-chairman at Toyota Kirloskar Motor. According to a study by the company cited by The Economic Times, after the steep tax and cess, it will take 17 years for a buyer to recoup the premium paid for hybrid cars. This would have taken just 18 months under the earlier VAT system. Karnataka industries minister R V Deshpande had written to union finance minister Arun Jaitley asking that hybrid and electric vehicles be taxed alike. Electric vehicles attract a GST rate of 12 per cent, in line with the government's stated intent to make India an all-electric market by 2030. Incidentally, the Camry is a 'strong' hybrid, which can run in purely electric mode, which a 'mild' hybrid can't.

VWatch video: 14 feet-long python tries to catch lizard. Those found indulging in free handling of snakes and posting such pictures on social media, with the sole motive of getting more likes, will be dealt with a heavy hand. At least that's what NGO Indian Snakes intends to do. As such callousness in handling snakes can pose serious dangers for those involved in it, the NGO has decided to start a campaign -- Save Snakes from Rescuers and Lovers -- in order to take corrective measures. The organisation has asked wildlife lovers who come across such pictures on social media to forward it to them, so that necessary action can be taken. Vava Suresh from Kerala, who claims to be a snake expert, has been facing criticism from herpetologists for the way in which he handles snakes. He also posts pictures with the animal on Facebook. Support pours in. According to sources, leading experts from the field of herpetology are supporting the initiative, because if the forest department takes effective action in such cases, then it will help in reducing deaths due to snakebites and instances of cruelty towards the animal. Speaking to mid-day, Herpetologist Jose Louis, who is also the founder of the website Indiansnakes.org, said, "We will soon write letters to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Ministry of Environment andForestand the chief wardens of the forest department across the country, requesting them to take appropriate action under the Wildlife Protection Act.". The NGO had come across a photo in which a cobra was seen with its mouth taped inside a forest. Following this, the members had discussed the matter with senior officials, who were ready to take action against such activities. Circular released. In 2014, WCCB had released a circular, which banned posting of such pictures on social media. However, many snake rescuers continue to post pictures, in which they are clearly seen handling the snakes without any safety equipment. "You can share the Facebook and Instagram links where people have posted pictures with snakes. We will examine each post and forward the ones against which action need to be taken to the officials concerned," said Shaleen Attre, senior survey coordinator, Indian Snakes. Herpetologist Kedar Bhide said, "Many snake rescuers have died performing daredevilry acts. They often posted such pictures on social media to get likes and comments. Such things should stop. We will share the pictures with WCCB and other departments to initiate strict action against those found indulging in unethical practices. If forest departments take action in this regard, then they should send the details of it to WCCB.".

VHere\u2019s the step by step & product breakdown on how to get Deepika Padukone's red carpet ready sleek low bun. . If you follow Deepika Padukone's beauty looks, you would know she is a fan of a dewy face of makeup and sleek low buns with sharp partings for events. Doing another interesting variation of those low buns again was Deepika Padukone on Diwali. Her hairstylist Amit Thakur, took to Instagram and shared a step by step breakdown of her look. Here is a tutorial and product breakdown on how to get Deepika Padukone's sleek low bun. . Step 1: Start with working the Oribe Balmdor heat styling shield on damp hair to seal in some sleekness and shine as the foundation for your hairstyle. . Step 2: Now, make a sharp deep side parting and blow-dry the hair all in the same direction. . Step 3: With your favourite Dyson supersonic hair dryer and a Mason Pearson brush, flat dry your hair, so that it has absolutely no volume. . Step 4: Using the GHD platinum straightener, straighten your hair section by section. Step 5: Now, with the help of a fine-toothed tail comb, comb all the hair from both the sides of the parting and tie a tight chic ponytail slightly below the occipital bone. . Step 6: Apply a generous amount of the Oribe gel serum on the ponytail and make it into a tightrope shape and go ahead twisting it tighter and create the shape you and secure it with pins. . P.S: While creating a chignon always keep a check if the shape and look is similar and balanced from both profiles. . Step 7: Take the Oribe Gel serum and apply it on the whole look for that sophisticated hold & shine. You can use a toothbrush to do this as it calms down the smallest of the hair and gives amazing sharpness to the look. . Step 8: Last but not the least, give your updo a healthy hairline with the help of root touch up. . And voila! You can NOW flaunt your.

VBharat Takhtani and Esha Deol.  Bollywood's quintessential 'Dream Girl' Hema Malini has become a grandmother for the second time. After her younger daughter Ahana Deol, who gave birth to a son (Darien) in 2015, her elder daughter Esha was blessed with a baby girl on October 20. Esha and her newborn were discharged from the hospital on Monday after which they headed to Hema's Juhu bungalow, where the veteran actress and Dharmendra welcomed the youngest addition to the family. .  A close friend of the family told us, "Hemaji welcomed her granddaughter by performing an aarti and traditional Tamil rituals. She was delighted as October 20 was also an auspicious day. She said, 'Ghar mein Lakshmi aayi hai'. Dharamji, who was in Lonavla, rushed to Mumbai to be with their new little bundle of joy. Both Esha and her baby are healthy and Ahana's son Darien, who is barely two years old, couldn't contain his happiness on seeing his little sister." .  While the family has zeroed in on a name, our source says that it will be made public on the baby's naming ceremony, which will happen soon. .

VRajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot and party workers are detained in Jaipur on October 23 during their protest against the tabling of an ordinance. Facing flak from various quarters, the Rajasthan government on Tuesday referred a controversial bill that seeks to protect public servants and judges from prosecution without its prior sanction to a select committee of the Assembly. Amid an uproar from the Opposition Congress, the Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill was tabled in the Assembly by Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria on Monday to replace an ordinance promulgated on September 7. At the beginning of Question Hour on Tuesday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Rathore said Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje held a meeting of Ministers on Monday night to discuss the Bill and that the Home Minister would apprise the House of the development. The Home Minister said that prior approval of the President was sought before introducing the ordinance in September. On Monday, Independent MLA Manik Chand Surana raised the point that no approval of the President was attached with the Bill. As the Opposition MLAs rushed into the well of the House demanding withdrawal of the Bill, Mr. Kataria said the government would consider the suggestions put forward by the members. He then moved a proposal to refer it to the select committee. The proposal was passed by the Assembly. The select committee was asked to submit a report in the next session. The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Ordinance, 2017, seeks to protect serving and former judges, magistrates and public servants in the State from being investigated for on-duty action, without government sanction. It also bars the media from reporting on such accusations till the sanction to proceed with the probe is given by the government. The move has been severely criticised by the Congress and the National People\u2019s Party (NPP) and senior BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari. The Editors Guild of India too opposed the \u201charmful ordinance\u201d and demanded its withdrawal. On Tuesday, Tiwari protested when he was not allowed to raise a point of order. . He objected to Speaker Kailash Meghwal giving permission to the Home Minister for giving his statement during Question Hour.

VWhere once tourists were welcomed with open arms, some cities and destinations are now trying to keep visitors at arm's length. Scotland's Isle of Skye has recently warned travellers to arrive with a prior booking as the island is swamped with tourists; graffiti in the Spanish city of Barcelona blares "Tourists go home" and "Gaudi hates you" as 32 million tourists descended in 2016; while Croatia's medieval Dubrovnik is planning to limit the number of visitors, as residents complain that a sharp rise in tourism is making life intolerable. But one European city is determined to find ways to accommodate everyone. The City Card gets people around the city. The Dutch capital of Amsterdam attracts over 14 million visitors each year. It experiences the same pressures on its infrastructure like other tourist hot-spots. But it is turning to technology and some clever common sense to ensure the city is welcoming to everyone. The Anne Frank museum is one of the city's biggest draws. For example, the city started to track tourists using the data stored on the chip inside Amsterdam's City Card, which gives access to various attractions and free public transport. It showed what time of day most tourists used sites like the Van Gogh Museum or taking trips on the canal. "We can see exactly how these people behave: Everybody comes to the city and goes to the Van Gogh Museum in the morning, and (takes) a canal boat in the afternoon," tourism chief Geerte Udo told Cond Nast Traveler. So when tourists bought the cards online they were advised of the best times to go to attractions. A live feed of the queues at places like the Van Gogh Museum are also on the site to encourage visitors to plan their trip for later in the day or plump for another destination altogether. Canal boat rides are very popular in the Dutch city. A strip of beach 29 kilometres away was renamed "Amsterdam Beach" to entice travellers further out of the city, and the City Card was extended to include more out-of-reach locations. A new phone app is also coming soon which alerts travellers when queues are busier than normal at destinations, and an English-language AI-powered service for Facebook messenger will be online next year which will scan your likes, comments etc and give you some unexpected suggestions on where to go. "You cannot close a city," said Udo. "It's such a short-term solution.".  "You have to make solutions for the future to cope with the local world.".

V Nothing can get better than this. Amazing stuff. You gonna be hungry after reading this completely. Take a look... . #2 Food .  Food has no substitute. No matter how much you try, you can never substitute food with anything in this world. Everyone loves food that tastes good but there is something else in every dish that is as important as the taste.  I am talking about the presentation. The way you present your food item is as important as how it tastes. A bad presentation can ruin your hard work even if the food is delicious.  You are about to see the most innovative thing ever done with different types of food items ahead. Keep reading ahead to witness the glory. . #1 Perfect Cubes .  A brilliantly filled plate full of tasty food items arranged royally is the best thing ever. The kind of satisfaction you get looking at delicious food properly put together is undefinable. .  Presenting you, "Cubes," an oddly tantalizing photograph by Dutch artists Lernert and Sander. The duo sliced the foods into identical morsels (2.5 cm on every side), and then neatly placed them on a neutral gray backdrop.  The image is loved by everyone and each and every single food item is looking so satisfying and pretty that it cannot be compared to any other pretty thing around us. Brilliant! .

VVikram Bakshi.  The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday adjourned the hearing of the contempt plea filed against fast food major McDonald's Corporation and its Indian arm by estranged Indian partner Vikram Bakshi.  During the proceedings, counsel appearing for McDonald's informed that the Delhi High Court would on October 25 hear a petition in which it has challenged the show cause notice for contempt issued by the tribunal.  Following this, an NCLT bench headed by Chairman Justice MM Kumar adjourned the matter to November 7 for the next hearing.  MIPL, a subsidiary of McDonald's Corporation had filed a writ petition before the High Court questioning the validity of the contempt notice issued by the NCLT against it.  On September 5, NCLT had issued a show-cause notice to fast food major McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's India Pvt Ltd (MIPL) over the contempt plea filed by Bakshi.  He had alleged that by terminating it licence the US-based food giant has violated the NCLT order dated July 13 which reinstated him as the Managing Director of CPRL and also refrained McDonald's Corporation to interfere in the functioning of CPRL.  Counsel for both sides submitted that they would try to complete their arguments before the high court on October 25.  The tribunal also directed the parties to file their replies based on the outcome of the high court order.  In August, the food chain had terminated the franchise licence of 169 outlets run by Bakshi in north and east India which led to a legal battle between the parties.  While Bakshi challenged the termination terming it as illegal, McDonalds' alleged breach of contract terms and payment default by Bakshi. .  Read More on .

V The wearable on steroids is helping to shape the company's health tech plans . Back in 2014, Samsung unveiled the Simband, a reference wearable that was packed with sensors. It was never intended to go on sale to consumers and was instead designed for developers to play around with. Those developers were able to use sensors that tracked blood pressure, skin temperature, sweat production, blood volume, heart rate and more. The Simband was considered a reaction to rumors the Apple Watch would be a revolutionary health device. When that turned out to not be the case, Samsung turned its attention to the Galaxy Gear instead. The Simband isn't dead though, according to Dr. Francis Ho, Samsung's head of digital health. Samsung Innovation and Strategic Center has still been plugging away on the project with researchers and companies for the past couple of years. . "We invited researchers to come in and use it to do new kinds of studies," he told us. "So we work with many of these top groups in the world and they use it for everything from autism studies to heart arrhythmia studies.". Samsung has also been making investments in digital health to improve upon the Simband. Externally, Samsung has been strategically investing in health-based startups. Internally, it's been developing new technologies for future sensors. Samsung doesn't want to make any announcements yet, but Ho says the company is looking to take ideas from the Simband to build into new commercial products that can health improve health. Samsung still believes in its "Voice of the Body" concept, which wants to make it as easy as possible for the human body to communicate health information to you through sensors. This includes things like your current state of health, but also studying the environment that affects your health, from the food you eat to your sleep quality. Also included in this idea is the idea of helping to predict or detect cancer at an earlier stage to make it easier to treat. It's nice to see that Samsung is still immensely serious in health. It's easy to forget, as Samsung Mobile has taken the lead on wearables with the Gear devices. It turns out another Samsung division, Samsung Innovation and Strategic Center has still been plugging away on the future of wearable health monitoring devices.

V\u201cLisson Presents\u2026 11 Artists Through Time\u201d at the London venue of Lisson Gallery. \u201cLisson Presents\u2026 11 Artists Through Time\u201d is the next iteration of the gallery series and presents the works of Marina Abramovi\u0107, James Casebere, Roy Colmer, Tony Cragg, Richard Deacon, Ryan Gander, Susan Hiller, Christian Jankowski, John Latham, Tony Oursler, and Richard Wentworth. All of these works are not instructional but intuitively assembled as a way to acknowledge time not only as a durational measure but as an ontological signature itself. In the exhibit, time and its relationship to context and history will be explored through the selection of works, and offer a discursive frame through which to read the contemporary milieu. . Lisson Gallery is considered to be one of the most influential and longest-running international Contemporary Art galleries in the world. It was founded in 1967 by Nicholas Logsdail. Since its inception, it has championed the careers of artists who have transformed the way art was made and presented. The works of various Minimal and Conceptual artists have been displayed here, including Sol LeWitt and Richard Long, as well as a whole generation of significant British sculptors from Anish Kapoor and Richard Deacon to Shirazeh Houshiary and Tony Cragg.

VISRO will launch several satellites including the replacement satellite for IRNSS-1A. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to launch a remote sensing satellite of Cartosat-2 series in December. As per a report in The Times of India, the launch which is the first after the failure of IRNSS-1H, will also include 30 nanosatellites belonging to different foreign countries. Dr K Sivan, director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), was quoted in the report, "Isro will be busy in launching a series of satellites from December onwards. We are targeting to launch Cartosat along with 30 nanosatellites of foreign countries in the second half of December.". The launch will be of utmost importance as it would grab widespread attention as it comes after the failure of ISRO\u2019s last satellite, IRNSS-1H. According to Sivan, ISRO has taken corrective measures after the failure. \u201cAfter the IRNSS-1H satellite failure, corrective measures will be taken in all rockets before the launches\u2026 initial findings suggested a defect in the pyro elements of the rocket which deal with the stage separation mechanism.\u201d.  The ISRO is all set to go on a busy launching schedule from December onwards. This will include the launching of three GSLV series satellites.    .

VDespite having the released first look and audio snippet from the project PSPK25, the fans are eagerly waiting for the announcement of the title since months. After crossing Dussehra and Diwali, a new date is in talks for the title announcement. Fans of Powerstar Pawan Kalyan gave up on their patience and demanding the announcement of the title of their matinee idol\u2019s 25th flick. As usual, the makers of this flick are still in their discussions about the title but a source close to the direction department updates a new thing. According to the source, the makers are thinking the speculated name Agnathavasi and the same will be revealed officially on the 7th of November, which will be the birthday of top director Trivikram himself. Again, this date too is a strong rumor for now but the sources say this time the announcement is for sure. Let us wait and see if they could reveal the title Agnathavasi or any other new one on 7th of November. Leaving all these aside, the team truly are focussing to wrap up this project anyhow by the end of November to release it on 10th of next year\u2019s January. This movie is bankrolled by S.Radha Krishna. Keerthi Suresh and Anu Emmanuel are the female leads. Anirudh Ravichander is scoring music for this flick. Apart from this, Pawan might do a flick under Mythri Movie Makers and Santosh Srinivas might direct it.

VHyderabad pacer Mohammed Siraj and Mumbai batsman Shreyas Iyer were the two new faces in the Indian T20 squad announced today for the three-match series against New Zealand starting 1st of next month. Despite speculation, skipper Virat Kohli has decided against taking rest from the New Zealand leg and the first two Tests against Sri Lanka, starting November 16. The first two Tests against Sri Lanka are to be held in Kolkata and Nagpur. In the Test squad Abhinav Mukund has made way for a fit opener Murali Vijay. Vijay did not take part in the last Test series due to hand injury and some other fitness related issues. Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja made a comeback in the longer version with Kuldeep Yadav being the third specialist spinner. Senior speedsters Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma are back in the squad for the five-day format along with Test specialists Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha. Ashish Nehra, who will retire after the first T20 game against NZ on November 1, has been picked for only that game scheduled in his home ground of Delhi. .

VIt\u2019s been years since Tyra Banks walked the runway, but make no mistake: her modeling skills remain in tact. In between hosting \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d developing her Tyra Beauty makeup line and finalizing business deals, the 43-year-old continues to serve smizes on her Instagram account. As with most drop dead gorgeous celebs, we\u2019ve come to expect those impossibly polished moments, but there\u2019s something about a makeup-free selfie that makes us scream \u201cyas!\u201d as we scroll the feed. It also reminds us that even with a glam squad in tow, famous women still have those down-to-earth moments we can all relate to. Such was the case when Banks went on a posting spree this week, sharing photos of her glowy skin in all its glory.  This special filter is called Crazy. It's that BFF fun-time filter. Well actually, there's #nofilter. It's just some good, ole fashioned, natural, cray-cray fun with the homie. Swipe and experience its glory. A post shared by Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) on Oct 18, 2017 at 12:57pm PDT.  Cape Cod (and my finger messing up the shot. Or maybe it's just a Flawsome moment.). A post shared by Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) on Oct 18, 2017 at 5:17pm PDT. \u201cThis special filter is called Crazy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s that BFF fun-time filter. Well actually, there\u2019s #nofilter. It\u2019s just some good, ole fashioned, natural, cray-cray fun with the homie.\u201d. The \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d creator went on to share more photos of her Cape Cod getaway, which immediately makes us want to drop everything and go on vacation; anyone with us?. This is no doubt some well-deserved R&R for the model mogul, who always seems to have a hand in something, all while raising her adorable son, York. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from this girl boss, it\u2019s that there\u2019s nothing wrong with letting your hair down after putting in hard work.

VMercedes-Benz has announced a recall for more than 10 lakh cars due to a faulty steering column component. The part is prone to failure and may cause the driver side airbag to deploy. . According to the car maker, cars sold in the UK (4 lakh), US (5 lakh) and Germany (1 lakh) have been affected. Cars built between November 2011 and July 2017 have been recalled and include the A-Class, B-Class, C-Class, E-Class and CLA sedans. GLA, GLC, GLK and some V-Class models have also been recalled. . Mercedes-Benz told that a steering column module spring is found to break. This causes the airbag warning light to come on. Further, faulty wiring could cause the driver side airbag to deploy. . Owners are being advised to visit their nearest Mercedes-Benz dealer should the airbag warning light come on. Owners of the affected cars are being notified about the recall, which will reportedly begin in the coming weeks depending on the availability of spare parts. Mercedes claims that the repairs will take about an hour. Some of the recalled models are also sold in the Indian market and hence it is likely that the Indian models could be affected as well. That said, Mercedes-Benz is yet to issue a recall of the said models in India. Source: DW.

VWashington: Beware, if there is inflammation in joints! As a study recently warns that people, especially women, with rheumatoid arthritis are 50 percent more chance to develop a lung disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term illness in which the immune system causes the body to attack itself, causing painful, swollen and stiff joints. It is this inflammation which is thought to lead to COPD - the umbrella term for diseases from emphysema to acute bronchitis which can cause wheezing and breathlessness so bad that it can hamper daily activities. According to researchers, rheumatoid arthritis sufferers have a 47 percent greater risk of the lung condition, while women with the condition see their danger rise by 61 percent. Lead author Dr Diane Lacaille from the University of British Columbia said, "These findings are novel because it has only recently been recognised that inflammation plays a role in the development of COPD, and clinicians treating people with rheumatoid arthritis are not aware that their patients are at increased risk of developing COPD.". Almost 25,000 people with arthritis were monitored for over a decade. The research showed that rheumatoid arthritis not only affects joints, but also lung disease. The authors emphasised the importance of getting the inflammation under control as soon as possible. Early symptoms include frequent chest infections and chesty coughs, as well as waking up in the night feeling breathless. The researchers followed 24,625 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 25,396 people who were free of the condition to record how many were hospitalised with COPD. To prevent this problem say anti-inflammatory drugs should be given to people in arthritis as quickly as possible. Dr Lacaille added that the results emphasise the need to control inflammation, and in fact to aim for complete eradication of inflammation through effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The research appears in the journal Arthritis Care & Research.

VToyota Camry Hybrid. Photo: Twitter.  With no respite for hybrid cars in the goods and services tax (GST) structure, Toyota Kirloskar Motors has halted the production of Camry Hybrid in Bengaluru\u2019s manufacturing plant. The new tax regime combined with attendant cess has made the vehicle too costly, said the company according to a news report in the Economic Times.  In the quarter ending September, Toyota witnessed drastic fall of 73 per cent in the sales figures of Camry Hybrid compared to the same period a year ago. The drop in sales figures are attributed to 28 per cent GST coupled with 15 per cent cess on luxury cars that increased price of Camry hybrid exponentially \u2013 from Rs 32 lakh to Rs 38 lakh (ex-showroom in Delhi).  The Camry hybrid fetched half of its sales number from the national capital where the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal cut the value added tax (VAT) on hybrid cars in a bid to reduce pollution levels. The hybrid contributed 12.8 crore tax in April-June period that reduced to Rs 9.3 crore in July-September period. .  In the wake of new tax regime, the company has also shelved plans to introduce a wide range of hybrids in India.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a business case to persuade our parent company in Japan to step up investments on hybrids in Bengaluru, given the punitive tax structure,\u201d said Shekar Viswanathan, vice-chairman at Toyota Kirloskar Motor to Economic Times. .  The Camry assembly facility on the outskirts of Bengaluru was launched five years ago. It also became one of the few facilities to assemble hybrid cars for the automaker outside Japan. The company said it has invested Rs 15 crore in the Camry hybrid facility in addition to Rs 24 crore on training, campaigns and service.

V Pakistan Rangers have violated the ceasefire 105 times this year along the 200-km international border in Jammu and Kashmir, the Border Security Force (BSF) said on Monday.  A senior BSF officer told the media that a woman and a BSF trooper were killed and 19 others, including 12 civilians and seven BSF troopers, were injured in the ceasefire violations.  Jammu and Kashmir has a 200-km international border which is guarded by the BSF on the Indian side and by the Rangers on the Pakistan side.  The officer said over 10,000 border residents were forced to temporarily migrate from their homes after the Rangers targeted civilian facilities.  "There have been nearly 12,000 ceasefire violations by Pakistan since 2002 which resulted in the killing of 313 people, including 144 security personnel. .  "The highest number of violations took place in 2002 when 8,376 incidents were reported while 2,045 incidents took place in 2003.".  India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement on the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border in November 2003.  The agreement brought a modicum of peace along the border and held well for nearly four years.  --IANS sq/mr. ( 203 Words).

VWashington: Ketamine - a medication commonly used for pain relief and depression - may help alleviate migraine pain in patients who have not been helped by other treatments, a study has found. The study of 61 patients found that almost 75 per cent experienced an improvement in their migraine intensity after a three- to seven-day course of inpatient treatment with ketamine. The drug is used to induce general anaesthesia but also provides powerful pain control for patients with many painful conditions in lower doses than its anaesthetic use. "Ketamine may hold promise as a treatment for migraine headaches in patients who have failed other treatments," said Eric Schwenk, director of orthopaedic anaesthesia at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in the US. "Our study focused only on short-term relief, but it is encouraging that this treatment might have the potential to help patients long-term. Our work provides the basis for future, prospective studies that involve larger numbers of patients," said Schwenk. An estimated 12 per cent of the US population suffers from migraines - recurring attacks of throbbing or pulsing moderate to severe pain. A subset of these patients, along with those who suffer from other types of headaches, do not respond to treatment. During a migraine, people are often very sensitive to light, sound and may become nauseated or vomit. Migraines are three times more common in women than in men. The researchers reviewed data for patients who received ketamine infusions for intractable migraine headaches - migraines that have failed all other therapies. On a scale of 0-10, the average migraine headache pain rating at admission was 7.5, compared with 3.4 on discharge. The average length of infusion was 5.1 days, and the day of lowest pain ratings was day 4. Adverse effects were generally mild, researchers said. "Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot definitively say that ketamine is entirely responsible for the pain relief, but we have provided a basis for additional larger studies to be undertaken," Schwenk said.

V Demonetisation, along with recently introduced Goods and Service Tax (GST), may impact the business of upcoming wedding season, staring November, by 10-15 per cent, industry chamber Assocham said here on Monday. Wedding services like marriage garden/marriage hall booking, tent booking, confectionery services and photography are expected to get impacted. At present the Indian wedding industry is about Rs 1 trillion and is growing at 25 to 30 per cent annually. The estimated cost of a wedding with no expenses spared could be between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 8 crore. "It is being estimated that the average cost of many wedding services like shopping, tent booking, food services, etc., is higher due to GST. The GST rate on most of these services is from 18 to 28 per cent. Before GST, most of the wedding service businesses like tent services, confectionery booking, etc., were using unregistered bills on which they didn't have to pay any tax," the chamber said. However, Assocham said destination wedding or the wedding tourism sector in India which accounts for less than 10 per cent share in the overall industry is not likely to face much adverse impact of GST and demonetisation as it is already a very costly affair which mainly lures foreigners, NRIs, rich and famous people for exotic weddings at beaches, royal palaces and adventurous places.

VBrezza SUV and Baleno hatchback will be delivered sooner with increased production at Maruti Suzuki Gujarat Plant. MSIL has planned a second shift at their Maruti Suzuki Gujarat plant. The plant started a single shift operation in February 2017 and the second shift, from October 2017, is set to reduce waiting periods on its two leading models, Brezza SUV and Baleno hatchback. Maruti Suzuki Gujarat plant (Hansalpur) currently produces 10,000 units of the Baleno each month. Brezza is produced at the Gurgaon plant and commands a waiting period of 5-6 months. The move to a second shift will help ease this waiting period to around 4 months and will help to reduce production pressure on both Gurgaon and Manesar plants. A second shift will not result in doubling of production immediately. Production increase will be gradual with focus on reduced waiting period. Increased demand has been noted for both the Baleno and Brezza. Baleno crossed the 2 lakh sales mark earlier this year and the Brezza passed 150,000 sales milestone in 17 months. Maruti Suzuki sales increased 9.3% in September 2017, with 1,51,400 units sold in domestic markets and 11,671 units exported. The UV segment, which included the Vitara Brezza, Ertiga and Gypsy saw an 8% increase in sales with 19,900 units sold during the past month. In the compact segment, the Swift, DZire, Ignis and Baleno noted a 44.7% increase in sales with 72,804 units sold as against 50,324 units sold in the same month of the previous year. 13,268 units of Vitara Brezza were sold in September 2017 up from 9,375 units sold in September 2016 to report 41.52 percent growth. For Maruti, the going looks strong with a number of its cars in the list of top 10 cars sold in H1 FY18. Alto sales are abound at 132,380 units for H1 FY18, followed by DZire, Baleno, Swift and WagonR. . Maruti Suzuki India exports stand at 57,300 passenger cars for H1 FY2018, up 6 percent from H1 FY17. Maruti Suzuki expects to finish the fiscal at double digit sales growth.

VEver felt that certain cravings hit you when you're on your period? Are those cravings different from the ones that you get any other time of the month?. Experts reveal that during your period, your body is going through physiological changes. Your hormones are out of whack and cause you to crave certain nutrients. During certain times, like your period or pregnancy, there are more active EOPs or endogenous opioid peptides which makes you have more cravings. So, you needn't be surprised if you're itching for more snack like foods or chocolates when you're on your period. The most common cravings during menstruation are salty foods or chocolate. Some studies have shown that 50% of women crave for chocolates at the onset of menstruation. The EOPs, amino acids bonds that are always present in the body are to be blamed for this. The main reason for the cravings behind chocolate is that, cocoa is high in magnesium that your body runs low on when you're menstruating or during the premenstrual phase. Make sure that you're going for dark chocolate as it has the necessary nutrients to curb your cravings. Cravings during your periods are actually harmless, except when you crave for some weird things like ice chips or things even worse. Some cravings are not normal and these might even be linked with anaemia. That is when you must hit the doctor. Moderation is very important, no matter what kind of craving it is. Apart from this, your hormones are to be blamed for, if you desire for candy or fries before periods. During this time, the pesky stress hormones called cortisol spikes and the feel good hormone serotonin dips. This fluctuation can make your body crave for more sugar and fatty foods.

VNew Delhi, October 24: Six opposition parties yesterday held a meeting in National capital to chalk out a strategy to counter the government over the fallout of demonetisation. The meeting held at senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's office was attended by TMC leader Derek O Brien, rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, Satish Chandra Mishra of BSP, Kanimozhi of DMK and CPI leader D Raja. Raja said, the meeting discussed about organizing joint opposition protest against the note-ban which will complete one year on the 8th of next month. He said, Azad will consult other opposition parties over the issue to take them onboard and finalize the schedule of the protest. A formal announcement on their strategy will be made on Tuesday morning at a joint press conference of Opposition leaders. The parties are also expected to take a united stand against the disqualification of JD (U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Ali Anwar from Rajya Sabha. Meanwhile, both Yechury and Ram Gopal Yadav were not present at Monday's meeting and Raja represented the Left parties. In the Rajya Sabha, there have been nine cases where parties have moved disqualification petitions against their members. Out of these, seven were referred to the privileges committee and two members resigned before the pleas could reach that stage.

VTOKYO - Oil prices inched up on Tuesday, supported by declining exports from southern Iraq. Oil exports from southern Iraq have fallen by 110,000 barrels per day this month, according to shipping data and an industry source, adding to the drop in flows caused by a shortfall from the northern Kirkuk fields when Iraqi forces retook control from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014. The drop in northern Iraqi shipments has supported global oil prices in recent days. But southern exports, the outlet for most of the country's crude, have been stable in recent months, making the decline unexpected. London Brent crude for December delivery was up 6 cents at $57.43 a barrel by 0055 GMT after settling down 38 cents on Monday. U.S. crude for December delivery was up 3 cents at $51.93, having settled up 6 cents. Crude oil exports through the Iraqi Kurdistan controlled-pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan rose 13 percent to 288,000 barrels per day (bpd) on Monday afternoon, less than half the normal levels, a shipping source told Reuters. U.S. crude inventories likely fell by 2.5 million barrels last week, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles also probably fell by at least 1.5 million barrels, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday ahead of data by the Industry group the American Petroleum Institute later in the day. [EIA/S] [API/S].

VWashington D.C. [USA], Oct 24 (ANI): US researchers have recently discovered that microbiome">lung microbiome plays a significant role in asthma severity and response to treatment. Senior study author Dr. Patricia Finn from the University of Illinois at Chicago said the microbiome is the ecosystem of good and bad bacteria living in the body. "Because the lungs continuously and automatically draw air and any number of environmental agents, into the body, the composition and balance of microbes in the lungs may have a profound effect on many respiratory conditions," Finn added. Asthma is a chronic disease in which lung airways become swollen and narrow, making it difficult for air to move in and out of lungs. Because people with asthma have inflamed airways, they experience a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness. In a group of clinically similar patients with asthma, the team identified two asthma phenotypes by assessing the microbiome and airway inflammation. The patients were ages 18 to 30 with mild or moderate atopic asthma. "This tells us the microbiome has relevance beyond the gut and that it is a potential biomarker for asthma," said another researcher Dr. David Perkins. These two phenotypes, called asthma phenotype one and two, or AP1 and AP2, are demarcated by the prevalence and dominance of different bacteria in the lung. When compared, patients in the two groups performed differently on pulmonary function tests. In both AP1 and AP2, the associations between the composition of the microbiome and specific inflammatory cytokines were decreased after treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid, a common asthma therapy. The researchers suggested that ICS may function by dampening responses to microbes. The data suggest that further study of the microbiome may help to develop more personalised treatment recommendations for patients with asthma. The research is published in PLOS ONE journal. (ANI).

VWait could be more than 6 weeks longer than those with private insurance, study says. Medicaid patients often lack access to dermatologists and may have trouble getting referrals for specialists. Surgery is the main treatment for melanoma -- a dangerous form of skin cancer -- but a patient's insurance could affect whether or not that cancer is quickly removed, new research suggests. After reviewing thousands of melanoma cases, researchers at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center reported that patients with Medicaid were more likely to face delays in scheduling their surgery than those with private insurance. Medicaid is the federally funded health insurance program for poor and needy people. "The primary treatment for most melanoma is surgical excision, which can be curative," said study author Dr. Ade Adamson, a clinical instructor in the UNC School of Medicine's department of dermatology. "These delays in care are concerning, particularly if they disproportionately affect those who might be the most vulnerable, such as Medicaid patients," he said in a hospital news release. Researchers reviewed the records of almost 8,000 patients from North Carolina. All had been diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2011. Patients had private health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare, the health insurance program for those 65 and older. Specifically, the study examined the amount of time between the patients' diagnoses and their surgery. The study showed that the patients with Medicaid were 36 percent more likely than those with private insurance to experience surgical delays. Folks with Medicaid were also more likely to wait more than six weeks for their surgery after being told that they had melanoma. Delays were also more common among patients who were not white. The patients least likely to wait for melanoma surgery were those with private insurance. Those who were diagnosed or operated on by a dermatologist were also less likely to face surgical delays, according to the findings. The researchers noted that Medicaid patients often lack access to dermatologists and may have trouble getting referrals for specialists, which could increase their risk for delays. "We have identified insurance type as a factor associated with timeliness of care delivered to patients with melanoma," said Dr. Nancy Thomas, chair of the School of Medicine's department of dermatology. The authors said more research is needed to determine what is causing the delays in melanoma surgery. "Once we figure this out we can think about ways to construct an intervention to make sure patients with this potentially deadly cancer get the timely, appropriate care they deserve," Adamson said. The study was published in JAMA Dermatology.

VA selection of artist Paulo Bruscky\u2019s work is on display at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The works are displayed as part of the project "L\u2019oeil coute," which means 'The Listening Eye.' The project reflects on modern art and is a platform allowing the exchange of dialogues between works from the permanent collection and by the invited artists. The project explores the shared relationship between music, art, and poetry and draws a parallel between the works by artists such as Picasso and Brancusi along with Russian Ballets and the music by Erik Satie. Bruscky\u2019s works displayed in this exhibition are his fundamental works of sound and visual poetry, performance and mail art that he developed throughout his career. Some of his works are to be incorporated in Pompidou\u2019s collection once the exhibition is over. While revisiting the works by the modern artists from the collection of the museum, Bruscky tries to reestablish the path between Brazil and France. This is often done by Vicente do Rego Monteiro. This is a unique opportunity to explore the sensitive look and intelligent humor, side-by-side, that connects two generations of Brazilian art to international artists who have fundamental relevance in the history of art.

VThe police arrested the man relying on the automatic translation feature on Facebook. Israeli police mistakenly arrested a Palestinian man after they thought he had published a Facebook post saying \u201churt them\u201d when he originally wrote \u201cGood morning\u201d, a media report said. According to a spokeswoman for the Israel Police\u2019s West Bank district, the police arrested the man relying on the automatic translation feature on Facebook that completely changed the meaning of what he had posted on the social media platform, The Times of Israel reported. The man, a construction worker, was arrested \u201con suspicion of incitement\u201d and released shortly after the assumption turned out to be false. In the post on October 15, the man was seen smiling and holding a cup of coffee and a cigarette while standing alongside a bulldozer at a construction site in the Beitar Illit settlement. \u201cNo Arabic-speaking officer read the post prior to the arrest, which was carried out by officers who relied solely on Facebook\u2019s automatic translation,\u201d Haaretz newspaper was cited as saying. The report in Times of Israel said that there is only a single letter\u2019s difference between the colloquial Arabic phrase for \u201cgood morning to you all\u201d and \u201churt them\u201d. Police combined the false translation with the image of the bulldozer \u2014 a vehicle that has been prominently used in terror attacks in the past \u2014 and assumed the man has the intentions to do the same. The police came to know the reality after they interrogated him and released him after realising their mistake.

V Stephen Hawking\u2019s PhD thesis is available online . If you ever ponder about how Stephen Hawking saw this universe when he was a 24-year-old Cambridge postgraduate student, you can know it just straight from the source. To celebrate Open Access Week 2017, his 1966 doctoral thesis has been published online for everyone to read. \u201cBy making my PhD thesis open access, I hope to inspire people around the world to look up at the stars and not down at their feet,\u201d says Hawking, hoping that giving free access to his early work will spark interests in both space itself and sharing research. It\u2019s not sure whether you will fully understand the Properties of Expanding Universes as it\u2019s not a light reading. Hawking challenged an existing gravitational theory by using the expansion of the universe, providing a gravitational radiation and expansion model from which we can see that space-time singularities are \u201cinevitable.\u201d. According to Cambridge University, the paper, which it calls \u201chistoric and compelling,\u201d was the most requested item for its open repository, receiving hundreds of request. In 1988, he published \u201cA Brief History of Time,\u201d which became one of the most successful books on science ever publishes. More than 10m copies of his book were sold in more than 40 languages. Making his early work available online is a great milestone for this generation of students. It will inspire other students to disclose their work without any fear.

Margao: Former Nuvem MLA Mickky Pacheco has urged dhirio admirers and organisers to question the law enforcement agencies on the law if they try to stop dhirio. Speaking today at Betalbatim, he said he was giving his protection to those holding dhirio claiming a law had been passed making it official. .  Mickky was speaking to a crowd of dhirio enthusiasts at Betalbatim. Mickky said "I love dhirio, and if all are together, I will stand by and facilitate dhirio. Give my name if the police stop dhirio. "  "The government or police cannot arrest anyone as there are laws framed during the Pratapsingh Rane Congress regime in 2006" said Mickky.  Accusing the police Mickky said "The police tighten noose and increase hafta of dhirio similarly like matka. Law is amended and passed and no one can be caught for it anymore. Government has made dhirio official. We have the right to question the government if they don't allow it".  Simon Caiado from Agacaim said "It is almost a small scale industry for some of the families of farming and agriculture" he said. Accusing the Congress, Simon said "Animal Rights had filed case against the dhirio in Goa and the then Congress Government did not even file a simple affidavit claiming that it is heritage and culture of Goa. If they had then dhirio would have survived, but they did not even wink on this issue" said Simon.  "It was us, dhiriyakaars who approached the court for relief" said Simon Caiado said.  .

VCape Town - Although a bit disappointed by recent results, Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic is optimistic that the Buccaneers are headed in the right direction. Saturday's 0-0 Soweto derby stalemate against Kaizer Chiefs was a third consecutive league draw for Pirates and means they have gone four matches without a win. However, the Sea Robbers remain nicely placed on the table \u2013 they are in third spot and just two points behind pace-setters Baroka FC. Looking at the bigger picture, Sredojevic is confident that his side are on the right track. "I am not worried, we are introducing a new set-up. We want to build our house, the performance, in a way that we have an identity," he was quoted saying by The Star. "We dominated our last four games, but the only thing that was missing was converting the chances we created," the Serbian elaborated. "In a marathon called the league, you have some bad patches but the most important thing is collecting the odd point here and there while you build your momentum. . "I am convinced that we will start to get wins. The performances that we have displayed are injecting us with immense confidence. We will continue playing our way. The results will come.". Pirates are next in action when they play Golden Arrows in a Telkom Knockout first round encounter in Durban on Saturday. Kick off is at 15:30.

V Gautam Dheer, DH News Service, Chandigarh, Oct 25 2017, 0:17 IST . Snakes of the sand boa species are estimated to be valued in excess of a crore of rupees in the international market. Representation image. Just when it appeared like another court hearing, the Chandigarh police in a dramatic way pulled out two snakes of the endangered sand boa species before a local Judge in an open courtroom on Monday. This, to testify that the two reptiles were alive and in safe custody. Snakes of the sand boa species are estimated to be valued in excess of a crore of rupees in the international market. Their price varies depending upon their weight and some other factors. The snakes were recovered from two persons who were trying to smuggle them to potential buyers. The Chandigarh police did not want to take any chances after it learnt that the snake species was an endangered one and fetches a whopping price. So, in less than two hours after the police managed to rescue the snakes from the smugglers, it deemed it appropriate to produce the snakes before the judge. The snakes were \u2018case property\u2019, but one which could not be retrieved at a later stage during the trial. Carefully, the sand boa snakes were pulled out of a bag and showed to the judge. After the drill, the judge ordered forest and wildlife officials to release the snakes in the forest. In fact, the police did not have a cue of the rarity of this reptile species until the officials of the wildlife wing were asked to pitch in. It was only thereafter that the cops got a whiff of what they had chanced upon. For the police it was a routine evening check-naka when the cops on duty asked two youth, both under 20 years of age, to stop for checking. They attempted to flee, but were nabbed. Inside the bag they were carrying were two sand boa snakes. Sources said, these snakes are smuggled to faraway places in Nepal for sale in South East Asian and even some western countries. This species is used for making medicines and other products.

VSinger and former model Grace Jones believes size zero in the fashion world is not "sexy at all", and that it is similar to "walking dead". Jones told The Guardian: "I'm glad I'm not doing it now (modelling). I'd probably be dead. Everybody's so skinny. Size zero is like the walking dead. Not sexy at all. "When I modelled, I would normally be a model size six, eight, though my shoulders are wide, it's hard to make them fit into things.". On her own fashion choices, she said: "Now I can't get into model sizes, because they're really small. When it comes to fashion, I'm loyal. I love Issey Miyake, Alaa, Kenzo, Philip Treacy. "I'm going to open a foundation in my mom's name, teaching sewing and creating fashion.". Jones is currently finishing off her eleventh studio album and has a documentary coming out about her called "Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami". It is directed by Sophie Fiennes.

V In a bid to promote trade and tourism to the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi government's Department of Culture and Tourism has organised the first-ever "Abu Dhabi Week" in India.  The week-long initiative to showcase the emirate's tourism, cultural heritage, art, entertainment and sports prowess through a multi-city exhibition is to be held from October 27 to 29 in Mumbai and from November 3 to 5 in New Delhi.  "India is a key tier-I priority for Abu Dhabi and represents our second-largest international source market for hotel guests. The 'Abu Dhabi Week', will encourage our partners and stakeholders to capitalise on the rapid growth of Indian visitors choosing to explore the emirate," Saif Saeed Ghobash, Director General, Department of Culture and Tourism - Abu Dhabi, said in a statement.  "Apart from positioning the emirate as a holiday destination, we will also underline the message that Abu Dhabi is an ideal business location for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry with a superb choice of venues," Ghobash added.  The "Abu Dhabi Week" will offer a variety of interactive experiences like virtual reality booths which will provide life-like encounters of Ferrari World, Desert Safari and Etihad Airways flights to give a hands-on sense of the remarkable Abu Dhabi experience.  "The 'Abu Dhabi Week' is a project through which we would like to bring the tourism fraternity and the consumer together to showcase the vibrant world of Abu Dhabi... I foresee this event as an encouragement of tourism and trade between India and Abu Dhabi," noted Bejan Dinshaw, Country Manager, Department of Culture and Tourism.  Tourism has witnessed a year-on-year increase of 9 per cent with Abu Dhabi welcoming 225,000 Indian hotel guests from January to August.

VTourism Minister KJ Alphons has promised a level-playing field for the hotel industry. DIPP, Ministry organise tourism-sector CEO forum .  The Tourism Ministry will take up the industry\u2019s concern on steep GST rates on high-end hotel rooms with the Finance Ministry and propose bringing them down to create a \u201clevel-playing field\u2019\u2019, said Union Tourism Minister KJ Alphons. . To enable mid-segment hotels to qualify for infrastructure status and priority lending, the Ministry is also working on a Cabinet note to bring down the threshold limit for hotel projects to \u20b950 crore from the current \u20b9200 crore, the Minister said at a press conference on Monday following a day-long conference with CEOs of tourism-related companies and start-ups. \u201cWe have set a target of increasing the annual foreign tourist arrivals into the country to 40 million from the present 14.4 million in five years\u2019 time and also increase job creation to 100 million from the present 43 million. These targets can be achieved by identifying the problems faced by the industry and sorting them out,\u201d Alphons said. On the present GST structure, the Minister said that the industry strongly felt that the 28 per cent rate on high-end rooms was much too high when compared globally. . \u201cPeople compare taxes throughout the world and if one finds that taxes in competing countries are lower at 10 per cent or 12 per cent, it takes away the level playing field. We will surely discuss this concern with the Finance Ministry and ask for lowering of the tax rate,\u201d he said. The tourism-sector CEO forum was jointly organised by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and the Tourism Ministry. \u201cThere were 111 delegates including 35 start-ups and eight representatives from States,\u201d said DIPP Secretary Ramesh Abhishek.  Room shortage . The participants pointed out that there was a shortage of 2 lakh hotel rooms in the country, particularly in the mid-segment with tariff or \u20b92,000 or below. . \u201cExtending infrastructure status to middle-range hotels and ensuring adequate and cheap credit to them will attract investment in the segment,\u201d Alphons said. The high cost of land was another factor identified by the CEOs as a constraint inhibiting growth of tourism and hotels in the country. . \u201cWe are proposing that land should be made available on lease, something on the lines of the Taj Man Singh model. Under this proposed structure, the investor can give a small lease amount and then pay a percentage of turnover,\u201d the Minister added. The Tourism Ministry is also exploring the idea of setting up a National Tourism Board to regulate activities within the sector including functioning of home-stays.

VSENSE vehicles will validate nanosatellite use in military space. Boeing has delivered two Space Environmental NanoSat Experiment (SENSE) satellites to the U.S. Air Force that will help assess the value of small satellites in military space operations. Weighing less than 9 pounds (4 kilograms) each and measuring 30 x 10 x 10 centimeters in size, the nanosats are scheduled to launch on the ORS-3 mission in the summer of 2013 and shortly after will begin collecting and transmitting weather data. Each nanosat contains a sensor and GPS receiver to gather data to support weather prediction and assessments. A miniature S-band transceiver downlinks spacecraft and mission data at one megabit per second. \u201cWe anticipate these nanosatellites will play a significant role as affordable and resilient assets in future Air Force space architectures,\u201d said Col. Scott Beidleman, director, Development Planning Directorate, Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center. \u201cWe look forward to the important data they will collect and provide to the warfighter.\u201d. \u201cThe SENSE nanosats offer customers an affordable, operationally robust option to conduct military missions using spacecraft no larger than a standard loaf of bread,\u201d said Bruce Chesley, Boeing director of Advanced Space & Intelligence Systems, a division of Boeing Phantom Works. Boeing worked with the Office of Naval Research, SRI International, The Aerospace Corp., and Atmospheric & Space Technology Research Associates to build, test and integrate the nanosats. The satellites are powered by highly efficient ultra triple-junction solar cells produced by Boeing subsidiary Spectrolab.

VUsman Khan took five wickets in just his second game as Pakistan demolished Sri Lanka by nine wickets in the fifth and final ODI in Sharjah to complete a five-nil series sweep. A left-arm seamer, Usman ripped the heart of the opposition top-order taking the first five wickets to fall as Sri Lanka stumbled to 20/5 inside seven overs. Three of the top five batsman of Sri Lanka failed to trouble the scorers as Usman demonstrated an array of seam and swing bowling to eventually finish with figures of 5-34 from seven overs. Thisara Perera, batting at number eight, top-scored for Sri Lanka with 25 while the only other players to reach double figures were Lahiru Thirimanne (19), Seekkuge Prasanna (16) and Dushmantha Chameera (11) as Sri Lanka were skittled out for 103 inside 27 overs. Seamer Hasan Ali (2-19) and leg-spinner Shadab Khan (2-24) took the rest of the wickets after the early bowling masterclass of Usman. Pakistan wasted little time in knocking off the runs as openers Imam-ul-Haq (45 not out) and Fakhar Zaman (48) put on 84 for the first wicket with the winning runs being hit in the 21st over. Both teams will now prepare for a three-match T20 series with the first game in Abu Dhabi on Thursday and the final match set to be played in Lahore on Sunday.

V  CHENNAI: PMK founder S Ramadoss on Monday demanded the government to test all alcoholic beverages sold through TASMAC wine shops. The PMK leader's statement comes a day after a TOI report revealed that liquor sold in the state owned marketing corporation liquor outlets are not being subjected to random testing. .  In a statement here, he said that it was unfortunate that alcoholic beverages sold in TASMAC wine shops were not tested in the last 14 years. Noting that it has come to light that a particular variety of rum had (high levels of) tartaric acid against the prescribed limit only after testing, he said, there are possibilities of similar issues with other brands, as well. .  It may be recalled that the TOI report said that a state-run food safety laboratory has declared that a bottle of rum sold at an TASMAC outlet in Koyembedu was of substandard quality after they found high levels of tartaric acid content. A test report by a Thanjavur-based Food Analysis Laboratory dated May 11 showed samples of the rum contained twice the tartaric acid against the prescribed limits. .

VIt is time for Golmaal Again to take on the big boys. The game has now moved on from the just an opening day or an opening weekend phenomenon. The film is now challenging the lifetime numbers of the best of 2017, and that too in the quickest time possible. Though it was just the Baahubali 2 [Hindi] phenomenon that had set the benchmark for records during the year, finally there is a Hindi film as well which is keeping the record keepers busy. This can well be seen from the fact that the Ajay Devgn starrer has now accumulated Rs. 92 crore* over the weekend already. With this, it is already well inside the list of Top-10 grossers of 2017 when it comes to the lifetime numbers, and there are bigger milestones set to be achieved before the Week One comes to a close. Here is looking at how lifetime collections of some of the biggest Hindi grossers have looked like in 2017: Raees \u2013 Rs. 137.75 crore Judwaa 2 \u2013 Rs. 137.35 crore* (still running) Toilet \u2013 Ek Prem Katha \u2013 Rs. 134.25 crore Tubelight \u2013 Rs. 120 crore Jolly LLB 2 \u2013 Rs. 117 crore Badrinath Ki Dulhania \u2013 Rs. 116.60 crore Kaabil \u2013 Rs. 103.84 crore Golmaal Again \u2013 Rs. 92 crore* (three days) Baadshaho \u2013 Rs. 78 crore Hindi Medium \u2013 Rs. 69.50 crore Jab Harry Met Sejal \u2013 Rs. 64.50 crore As can be seen, the film is now just a few crore away from its nearest competition, while the lifetime numbers of Tubelight are expected to be surpassed today. That would bring the multi-starrer horror-comedy into a zone from where it is a matter of time before Raees, Judwaa and Toilet \u2013 Ek Prem Katha collections are challenged as well, each of which scored in an upwards of Rs. 130 crore. Will that happen within one week itself for Golmaal Again? Yes, very likely, and that would be one proud feat indeed for the film which is now aiming for a humungous total indeed before Padmavati hits the screens on 1st December.

VNeymar believes his sending off during Paris Saint-Germain's draw against Marseille was unfair. Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar. Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar felt his red card against Marseille was harsh, saying he had numerous marks on his body to show from the Le Classique. The Brazil forward was sent off in the 87th minute of Sunday's 2-2 draw after clashing with Lucas Ocampos and picking up a second yellow card. Neymar was fouled five times \u20ac\u201c the most of any player \u20ac\u201c during the encounter, which PSG took a point from thanks to Edinson Cavani's free-kick. The 25-year-old, who earlier delayed taking a corner as objects thrown from the stands rained down around him, was unhappy with his sending off, criticising referee Ruddy Buquet. "I think it was exaggerated, yes. And unfair. I spent the whole game getting enough. I have many marks on my body," Neymar told Esporte Interativo. "It was a move I tried to continue after suffering a foul. I was annoyed at the blow from behind.". Neymar added: "The referee did what he wanted, which was to send me off and appear more than the players.". PSG are four points clear atop Ligue 1 after the draw, with Neymar set to miss Friday's clash against Nice.

VThat's some pretty wild OLED burn-in on the Pixel 2 XL after maybe 7 days of full-time use pic.twitter.com/EPJTs6D0Kg. \u2014 Alex Dobie (@alexdobie) 22 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2017 \u0433. . After reports from users and reviewers alike that the Pixel 2 XL's P-OLED display is coming with irregularly lit pixels resulting in scattered brightness spots and dull colors in comparison to, say, Samsung flagships' default mode, even in the "vivid" regime, now comes another serious issue - screen burn-in. We thought that burn-in is a thing of the past with OLED displays, as only the first generations struggled with the challenge to prolong the lifespan of the blue LEDs that were made of ingredients that degraded quicker than the other colors. Now, however, some Pixel 2 XL users are reporting that they can see ghosting of the navigational strip at the bottom of the display when you show a gray background there. It's only been a few days since the official release date of the Pixels, and, if the problem persists, this might turn into a classical case of burn-in that will only become more visible with time. That is why when asked for comment, a Google spokesperson said that they will be looking deeper into the matter:. The Pixel 2 XL screen has been designed with an advanced POLED technology, including QHD+ resolution, wide color gamut, and high contrast ratio for natural and beautiful colors and renderings. We put all of our products through extensive quality testing before launch and in the manufacturing of every unit. We are actively investigating this report. The Pixel 2 XL reportedly uses a panel very similar to the LG V30, and there were reports about uneven brightness with the V30's preview units, but on the retail version which we got recently, everything was fine in that respect, so hopefully these are teething problems with the first batches, and Google will come out with the reason for these mishaps soon.

VAccording to the prosecution, secret information was received by police officials that on April 12, 2016, the accused will be carrying 200 grams of heroin near the Kashmere Gate metro station. A raid was conducted and the accused was arrested. . Representational purpose. A man has been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment for possessing 200 grams of heroin, with a Delhi court saying non-joining of independent witnesses was no ground to reject police\u2019s testimony. Special NDPS Judge Narinder Kumar handed down the jail term to the man, an Uttar Pradesh native, holding him guilty under the provision of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. \u201cThe evidence of police officials cannot be rejected per se merely because independent public witnesses are not associated and it puts the court on guard to scrutinize the statement of police officials with great care and caution,\u201d the judge said and also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him. According to the prosecution, secret information was received by police officials that on April 12, 2016, the accused will be carrying 200 grams of heroin near the Kashmere Gate metro station.

V Alwar: The forest guards have found skin parts and other remains of a sambhar (Rusa unicolour) from Sariska forests, suggesting that hunters could be active in the reserved area once again. .  The remains were recovered by guards inside Akbarpur range of Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR). The officials said that about five to six poachers, armed with firearms, had managed to sneak into the forest in the early hours on Monday. The poachers shot a sambhar not far from the check post located in Rotkela village. .  "There were two forest guards inside the check post. They heard gunshots but could not launch an assault on poachers as guards did not have weapons on them. Instead, the guards alerted their counterparts in Akbarpur range," the official said. .  A special search team was formed to track poachers hiding in the area; the team arrived near Rotkela village where they discovered the remains of the wild animal, the poachers, however, had fled. The forest officials said that an operation is underway to nab suspects. .  Despite multiple incidents of poachers intruding into the STR limits, the forest guards here have not been equipped with firearms to take on poachers. On Sunday night too, the forest guards found themselves unable to confront armed poachers as they did not have firearms. .  This is not the first incident of poachers intruding into the STR. In January this year, poachers had opened fire inside a village in STR and wounded several villagers and forest guards. "The forest guards have not been provided any guns, the poachers, on the other hand, are always fully armed and have shown penchant to open fire at our guards," said the official. .  Ironically, the forest guards at STR have been left to defend the wildlife with sticks. The latest incident of poaching has inflamed fresh fears about the safety of the tigers in the STR. .

VThree hikers can now be called heroes after they risked their lives to rescue a dog in distress stuck at the bottom of an abandoned mine shaft. Portia Scovern\u2019s boyfriend was hiking near Fairplay, Colorado when he heard something from the cavernous space, but he didn\u2019t think twice about it. He continued on his journey without giving it a second thought. But when he returned with Portia and a friend, they heard that the noise was really a bark. This time, it was more distinct, and they could tell that it was, indeed, a dog stuck at the bottom of the mining shaft. They knew they couldn\u2019t leave the pooch behind. One of them descended into the hole and managed to pull the starving pup to safety. He may have risked his life going all the way down in that hole. The dog was a female, and it looked like she hadn\u2019t eaten in quite some time. She was skinny and had clearly lost weight. They fed and bathed her while searching for the dog\u2019s owner. Thankfully, her human was located in no time, and she was able to go home! Hopefully, she won\u2019t stray like this again and end up in another tough spot!. More Stories from LittleThings.

VChurch of the Good Shepherd, Tekapo. Lorna Thornber's recent article which boldly declares Tekapo to be better than Iceland was sent to me by a friend seeking my opinion shortly after I returned to Wellington from my own trip to Iceland. I couldn't comment \u2013 I'd never ventured to Tekapo, but the article inspired me to change that fact pretty quickly. Two weeks later I stood in front of the most photographed church in the country at 10am on a Friday morning as masses of tourists wandered around obstructing my chances of that perfect photo. There are some definite advantages when it comes to travelling in your own country and not having to calculate exchange rates with every purchase is one of them. I'd been warned Iceland was expensive to visit, but it was largely in terms of "take your own alcohol" and not the practicalities of visiting. Everything is expensive - food, transport, accommodation and attractions. ingvellir National Park, Iceland. Short on time, when I visited Iceland in August I didn't get the chance to escape the heavy tourist areas of Reykjavik, The Blue Lagoon and The Golden Circle. In parts, Iceland is barren and deserted. Comparable to the moon, much like parts of New Zealand's National Parks. On Instagram, the Blue Lagoon appears blue, natural and rocky, with minimal human intervention. In reality, the water was green in colour, there were people everywhere, diggers and a geothermal power station on one side of the lagoon, and the visitor's centre on the other side was undergoing a building extension. Without the power station, there would be no hot pools. And while my own Instagram photos were also perfectly cropped, I ruined the ideals of many friends and family when I told them my story. I can assure you that Lake Tekapo is the perfect blue and the snow-capped mountains are gorgeous. But I was also cropping tourists out of my photos, and like Iceland, back in town near the Four Square there were power stations, diggers and construction work. Having now visited both destinations, if I was to compare Iceland to anywhere it would be the central North Island with its mountains, lakes, rocky terrain and geysers. Both Iceland and Tekapo are fast becoming over visited and expensive. But you go there knowing this and what you're in for anyway. I only hope they don't end up as far gone as Patong Beach in Phuket, the destination I associate with popularity ruining something once beautiful. My take is that you shouldn't rule out visiting a destination because you've seen it's local equivalent. See them both. Be able to appreciate your own backyard and know the differences and similarities when you explore further afield and tell others your experiences.

VLenovo is rumoured to bring back the \u2018Play\u2019 model in its Moto lineup next year, with the company\u2019s Moto G6 Play. Prolific tipster Evan Blass has claimed that the Play variant will return to Moto G series next year. The Moto G6 Play is expected to be revealed alongside the Moto G6 and Moto G6 Plus. Lenovo somehow gave the Play variant a miss for the fifth-generation Moto G range which included Moto G5, Moto G5S, Moto G5 Plus, and Moto G5S Plus. Motorola brand\u2019s idea of introducing \u2018Play\u2019 variant was to offer a new smartphone with some additional features. To recall, the Moto G4 Play was the last of its kind and was launched in September last year. The Moto G4 Play was seen as a toned down version of Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus. There are no details of the new Moto G smartphones on the Internet currently but we can expect to hear more in coming months. It is also widely expected that the company may reveal the Moto G6 and Moto G6 Plus ahead of the Moto G6 Play launch, which has been a pattern for other Play variants. For those unaware, the first ever Moto G Play was launched as a Google Play Edition device back in 2014 though it didn\u2019t see too many takers. Last year, the Moto G4 Play budget smartphone was launched at Rs. 8,999 in India. The Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus were launched at Rs. 12,499 and Rs. 13,499 respectively.

VAhmedabad(Gujarat) Oct.23 (ANI): Patidar leader Narendra Patel a close aide of Hardik Patel on Sunday alleged that he was offered a whooping amount of Rs 1 crore to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid inching state polls. In a midnight press conference, Narendra said that he had already received Rs. 10 lakh as token money. Showing the received amount to the press Narendra said, "Varun Patel took me to a meeting where it was discussed that I will be given Rs 1 crore. In the meeting, they told me to keep Rs. 10 lakh and the rest money will be given to me later.". He further asserted that he is true 'Patidar' and no one can buy him," I am here for the society and want to do something good for the society. No one can buy me from such money. I am a Patidar. I came here for the welfare of Patidars not to do politics.". Besides Varun Patel, Narendra also mentioned the name of prominent Gujarat BJP leader Jitubhai Vaghani. Narendra also alleged that Varun Patel arranged a meeting with Jeetu Vaghani in Gandhinagar where he was lured by the BJP to join their bandwagon. However, Varun Patel has rejected Narendra's allegations and questioned his intentions behind conducting a press conference after receiving Rs 10 lakh. Varun said," He should have conducted the press conference after taking Rs 1 crore rather than 10 lakh.". Varun also took the occasion to slam Congress and said "Since the patidar community is once again supporting BJP, the Congress is agitated and playing games.". Recently, Patidar leaders Reshma Patel and Varun Patel announced their decision of joining the BJP following their meeting with party Chief Amit Shah. (ANI).

VBRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Michel Temer has the authority to revoke the asylum status a former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in Italy and extradite him at his country\u2019s request. .  FILE PHOTO: Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti leaves the headquarters of the Federal Police in Sao Paulo, Brazil March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo . Cesare Battisti committed four murders in the 1970s when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism, according to the Italian government. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy. . Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court authorized Battisti\u2019s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to Italy because former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010. . In a note to the top court, the government\u2019s chief lawyer Grace Mendona argued that extradition was a political decision that only the president could make. . She reminded the court that it had approved Battisti\u2019s extradition in 2009 and asked the justices to reject a habeas corpus writ issued ten days ago by one of its members. . Battisti was arrested on Oct. 4 as he tried to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that Brazil\u2019s government was about to revoke his asylum status at Italy\u2019s request. He was freed two days later. . Lula\u2019s refusal to extradite Battisti upset relations between Brazil and Italy. Temer, a center-right president who took office when Lula\u2019s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year, decided it was time to remove that thorn. .

VAre you a kitchen disaster magnet? From grease fires to glasses stuck together, here are some tips for dealing with common kitchen mishaps. . Be safe and follow these tips to stop a disaster in its tracks. . Kill a Kitchen Fire in Two Seconds Flat. If there\u2019s a grease fire in a pan, cover the pan immediately with a lid. You\u2019ll cut off the oxygen supply and the fire will go out. Baking soda is one of the best fire extinguishers. Because it creates carbon dioxide, it will prevent oxygen from feeding the flames. Always keep an open box next to the stove to dump onto grease fires\u2014and never use water! . Safety Salt. Water should never, ever be thrown on a grease fire, because it will only spread. If there\u2019s a fire caused by grease or oil in your kitchen, throw salt on it until it is extinguished. The salt will absorb the liquid causing the flames. . Microwave Safety . Microwave doors may become misaligned, especially if you pull down on them when opening them. When the doors don\u2019t close properly, the oven can leak radiation, making your food take longer to cook. . Unstick Stuck Glasses. You reach to get a glass out of a stack of glasses, only to realize they\u2019re stuck together. Reach into the cabinet again to get some vegetable oil, then pour a bit down the side of the glasses to unstick them without the risk of breaking them. The Magic of Science. Another trick for unsticking glasses? Put a couple of ice cubes in the top glass and set the bottom one in a bowl of warm water. Remember high school chemistry? Heat expands. Cold contracts. And your glasses will unstick! .

VPREPARE to be petrified as Alton Towers adds "The Welcoming: Be Chosen" to its terrifying scare mazes. It provides all the horrors, frights and thrills you'd expect from the country's biggest Halloween extravaganza. Terrifying new maze at Alton Towers opens for Halloweeen. But it also offers a preview of the theme park's new attraction for 2018, its first wooden rollercoaster, codenamed Secret Weapon 8, as the wooden theme plays a big part in The Welcoming maze. The woods surrounding the village have been harbouring a mysterious group who, until recently, had been unseen by the modern world. But they are angered by people abusing the world and you have been Chosen to take part in their annual Halloween celebration. But what part will you play?. If you need more scares, your mazes ticket price also includes entry to Altonville Mine Tours, Terror of the Towers, Sub Species: The End Games and the "childfriendly" House of Monsters. Scarefest is in full swing at Alton Towers for the Halloween season. We all try to cram everything in to the few short hours the resort is open. And visit on a busy weekend or a school holiday and doing it all is nigh on impossible. But it is possible to take it at a more leisurely pace \u2014 and to relax at Alton Towers Hotel in a bedroom with moon-themed futuristic decor and gadgets. That is because the hotel is based around the adventures of the mysterious Sir Algenon who crash landed on the moon and made it his home. But this time of year, with Scarefest in full swing, the whole place has been given a thorough dusting of hocus pocus. There's fun for all the family at the child-friendly House of Monsters show. But the best thing about staying the night in the hotel is that it gives you the next day to explore the resort's other theme park, Alton Towers Waterpark. With slides, waterfalls, a Wacky Waterworks Tree House, inflatables and more, it will keep even the biggest kid entertained. But if you're not convinced by my adventures at the hotel, Alton Towers also has numerous other themed rooms, including pirates, chocolates and Arabian nights. There is also CBeebies Land Hotel, Splash Landings Hotel, Woodland Lodges and luxury treehouses. They're enough to bring out the big kid in the oldest of you. GO: ALTON TOWERS. Scarefest runs until October 31. Alton Towers currently has availability at its Splash Landings Hotel, with its Kids Go Free deal from 199 per room for the night based on a family of four, including B&B and theme park tickets. Theme park tickets available from 32 for an adult and 27.50 for a child when booked in advance at altontowers.com.

VFor a long time now, there\u2019s been a trend in the gaming industry where the focus often falls on multiplayer titles at the expense of single-player experiences. A recent interview with a former  BioWare  developer has shed light on why this might be. Unsurprisingly, a lot of it comes down to money.  Speaking on Waypoint\u2019s podcast , Manveer Heir, a gameplay designer who was at BioWare for seven years and worked on Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect Andromeda, says the shift toward multiplayer is simply a matter of monetization for the companies. . "It's definitely a thing inside of  EA , they are generally pushing for more open-world games," says Heir. "And the reason is you can monetize them better. The words in there that were used are 'have them come back again and again'. Why do you care about that at EA? The reason you care about that is because microtransactions: buying card packs in the Mass Effect games, the multiplayer. It's the same reason we added card packs to Mass Effect 3: how do you get people to keep coming back to a thing instead of 'just' playing for 60 to 100 hours?".  BioWare owner EA recently announced the closure of Dead Space creator Visceral Games. Additionally, the in-development Star Wars game is moving away from a story-based, linear adventure into something \u201cplayers will want to come back to and enjoy for a long time to come.\u201d . Many publishers now look at  microtransactions  as the best way to continually squeeze money from a game. Heir said he\u2019s seen people spend $15,000 on Mass Effect multiplayer cards. The problem is partly due to the spiralling costs associated with developing AAA games, and the need to recoup that expenditure. "You need to understand the amount of money that's at play with microtransactions," he added. "I'm not allowed to say the number but I can tell you that when Mass Effect 3 multiplayer came out, those card packs we were selling, the amount of money we made just off those card packs was so significant--that's the reason Dragon Age has multiplayer, that's the reason other EA products started getting multiplayer that hadn't really had them before, because we nailed it and brought in a ton of money.". Heir said the Destiny-style multiplayer title Anthem, which is set to arrive on PC and consoles next year, is a prime example of how firms now prioritize games as a service. It\u2019s also why Anthem looks so different from traditional BioWare output. He predicts that \u201cthe linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being.\u201d.

VUntil we insist that candidates address science and technology policy when campaigning, we cannot expect them to do so once they\u2019re in office. Advertisement. Science is inherently related to every significant challenge of the 21st century, yet in 2017, scientific experts have been increasingly ignored, dismissed and silenced by policymakers. Today, Science Debate is calling for all House, Senate and Gubernatorial candidates running for office across parties to respond to 10 questions related to the greatest science policy challenges facing America. Topics cover a wide range of issues from scientific integrity in policymaking to health, cyber security medicine and the environment. Since 2008, every major presidential candidate has answered a series of questions on science policy put forth by Science Debate and our broad coalition of partners (including Scientific American). In his response to Science Debate last Fall, President Donald Trump pledged:. \u201cMy administration will ensure that there will be total transparency and accountability [regarding science] without political bias. The American people deserve this and I will make sure this is the culture of my administration.\u201d. After many 2018 Congressional candidates inquired about participating in a similar Q&A, our team at Science Debate decided to open questions across levels of government. We believe that every incoming politician should be prepared to address issues crucial to voters, our children and the future of our planet. On our website, you\u2019ll find a map where you can select your state and read about the science policy positions of those running for office where you live as they come in. Until we insist that candidates address science and technology policy when campaigning, we cannot expect them to do so once they\u2019re in office. We encourage you to reach out to candidates in your communities and encourage them to participate in Science Debate\u2019s 2018 Election Initiative!. Visit sciencedebate.org for more information about the 2018 election initiative as well as other ways to get involved in projects we\u2019re working on. As a registered 501(c)(3), Science Debate is nonpartisan and all donations are tax-deductible.

VMats Hummels  Gallo Images.  Bayern Munich have new injury concerns for this week's double-header against RB Leipzig with Mats Hummels joining Thomas Mueller on the walking wounded list, according to German daily Bild.  Bayern's stand-in captain Mueller limped out of Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with what Bild claim is a torn hamstring which will keep him out for six weeks.  The injury happened as the Germany star tried to use his heel to make a pass during his ten minutes on the field before having to go off injured.  Hummels also picked up an ankle injury in Hamburg.  However, there is still hope the centre-back can play in Wednesday's German Cup, second-round, clash at RB Leipzig and Saturday's Bundesliga clash against third-placed Leipzig in Munich.  Bayern, who are second in Germany's top flight, have yet to confirm either injury, but the loss of Mueller would be a blow.  He would be the second Bayern captain to succumb to injury in recent weeks with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer ruled out until January with a fractured foot.  Bayern winger Arjen Robben said they need their Germany star fit as quickly as possible with a key league game at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund coming up in the next two weeks.  "It's always a worry when a player drops out with injury," said the Dutchman.  "We don't need that at the moment. Thomas is now our captain and is very important.".

V Condemning the murderous attack on senior SAD\u2019s Muktsar district president Dyal Singh Kolianwali\u2019s son Parminder Singh Kolianwali allegedly by the Congressmen, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Monday said that it was symptomatic of the jungle raj prevailing in Punjab under the Congress rule.  \u201cIncidents of attacks of Akali leaders and workers started right after the establishment of the Congress government and are going on blatantly without any stop. Kolianwali\u2019s son was not given adequate protection despite repeated requests to the State police that his life was under threat,\u201d he said. .  Asking the Congress government to display the political will needed to stop the wave of vendetta incidents in the State, Sukhbir said that they had been continuing right since the killing of Akali leader Gurbachan Singh Khalsa immediately after the assembly election in Gurdaspur.  He said that after this, there were numerous killings including those in Khemkaran, Mansa, Ferozepur and Muktsar. \u201cAkali workers were attacked at numerous places. Many were humiliated by being molested and disrobed. False cases are being registered enmass against Akali sarpanches and councillors to make them toe the Congress line,\u201d he said. .  Stating that the goondaraj unleashed by the Congress leaders and party workers had even emboldened anti-social and anti-national elements, Sukhbir said that the State had witnessed a number of murders designed to spoil the communal atmosphere. .  While Pastor Sultan Masih had been murdered in Ludhiana earlier, now RSS leader Ravinder Gosain had also been murdered in Ludhiana, he added. .

A woman talks on the phone at the Airbnb office headquarters in the SOMA district of San Francisco, California, U.S., August 2, 2016. REUTERS/Gabrielle Lurie  . Hong Ge, who previously worked for Google Inc and Facebook Inc, left to pursue another role and the firm is yet to name a successor, said Airbnb in a short statement on Tuesday. . Reuters was unable to reach Ge for comment on Tuesday morning. . Kum Hong Siew, the current president of China operations will take over the role in an interim capacity. . Airbnb faces tough regulatory challenges in China, where movement between cities is closely monitored and people are required to register temporary stays with local police. . Last week, the company announced that co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk would become chairman of Airbnb\u2019s China arm, which goes under the name of \u2018Aibiying\u2019 and competes against local services Tujia.com and Xiaozhu.com. . Airbnb in that announcement also said it has plans to double the number staff in China over the next year and introduce new quality standards. . This month Chinese authorities banned listings on all short-term rental apps in central Beijing during the 19th Congress, a high-profile political event where police increase scrutiny of illegal movement and people who fail to register their residences. . Airbnb, which has roughly 120,000 listing in China, has also had to comply with a national cyber law introduced in 2016 that requires private user data to be stored locally. .

VNASA spends approximately $1.4 billion annually on a portfolio of IT assets it uses to control spacecraft. NASA\u2019s slow progress in improving its IT governance over the past four years could put the agency at risk of experiencing security breaches, warns an audit report. Information Technology (IT) plays an integral role in every facet of NASA\u2019s space, science and aeronautics operations. The agency spends approximately $1.4 billion annually on a portfolio of IT assets it uses to control spacecraft, collect and process scientific data, secure its IT infrastructure and enable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) personnel to collaborate with colleagues around the world. In its 2013 report, the Office of Inspector General (IG) found that the decentralised nature of agency operations and longstanding culture of autonomy hindered NASA\u2019s ability to implement effective IT governance. \u201cWe made eight recommendations and NASA agreed to take action to address our concerns,\u201d the IG report said. In this latest audit, the Office of Inspector General evaluated NASA\u2019s progress in implementing changes to its IT governance structure. But in the four years since issuance of the IT governance report, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has made insufficient progress to improve NASA\u2019s IT governance, casting doubts on the office\u2019s ability to effectively oversee the agency\u2019s IT assets, according to the report issued this week. \u201cSpecifically, the NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO) continues to have limited visibility into IT investments across the agency,\u201d the report said. Ineffective IT governance can result in security breaches, increased costs, missed deadlines, and provision of low quality IT products and services, the report pointed out.

V  Hyderabad, Oct 23:  .  The consortium of lenders who had approved a Corporate Debt Restructure package to IVRCL have decided to exit the CDR mechanism. .  In a regulatory filing made to the BSE, the Hyderabad-based construction and infrastructure company said it received communication from Corporate Debt Restructuring Cell informing that the lenders have decided to exit the CDR mechanism, which was extended to the company to facilitate its turnaround, bringing down the interest rate and extending moratorium on loans. .  Subsequently, the lenders had also invoked the provision of the Strategic Debt Restructure. They also converted some of the debt into equity to pave way for divestment of some of the matured assets, to ease up the debt burden on the company. .  The decision to back out from the debt restructure comes after the CDR empowered group held a detailed meet deliberating with the lenders on the way forward. The empowered group approved the exit of the lenders from the account of the company from the CDR package. .  The lenders have attributed this to failure of the CDR mechanism. .  The woes of the company continue to mount after an under construction flyover on Kolkata collapsed leading to death of 27 people. .  Earlier this year, the long pending proposal of the Tata group entity TRIL, which had struck a deal with IVRCL to buyout its three tollways in Tamil Nadu, failed and the company decided to back out. This also added to already piled up woes of IVRCL. .

Rahul Modi, MD and CEO, Adarsh Credit Co-operative Society, said: \u201cThis tie up will be a game changer in the financial landscape of Rural India. With Oxigen\u2019s Micro ATM, Adarsh Credit will reach it\u2019s 2020 target of acquiring one lakh new villages, that will become financially inclusive. .  \u201cAdarsh Credit with 100 per cent of its business through a digital framework, will now be able to provide its advisors with Oxigen\u2019s Micro-ATM services, e-KYC, virtual Rupay Card, AEPS, value-added services and more.\u201d .

VThe tail forms a twisted shape when in contact with the solar wind. Mars is the most sought interesting and curious planet in the solar system for us on earth. The Red Planet has the closest possible habitable situations for us earthlings if we ever plan on colonizing the solar system. NASA\u2018s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN) started its journey on November, 2014 and studies the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere. The latest discovery from MAVEN reveals that Mars has a twisted \u201ctail\u201d. This invisible magnetic tail is said to form a twisted shape when interacting with the solar wind. As explained by Gina DiBraccio of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Mars\u2019 magnetic tail isn\u2019t \u201clike the magnetotail found at Venus, a planet with no magnetic field of its own, nor is it like Earth\u2019s, which is surrounded by its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, it is a hybrid between the two.\u201d. The twist in the magnetic tail is explained to have been developed by a process called \u201cmagnetic reconnection\u201d. This process occurs when the magnetic fields which are carried by the solar wind merge with the planet\u2019s magnetic fields. MAVEN\u2019s research team further says that this twisted tail could \u201callow some of Mars\u2019 already thin atmosphere to escape to space\u201d. The magnetic reconnection also releases energy which could drive actively propel ions in Mars\u2019 atmosphere which can pass through the magnetic tail and released into space.

NASA\u2019s MAVEN research team will continue to study if the escaped particles in space is the cause behind Mars losing its atmosphere. The study will also observe how over the years the magnetic fields in Mars\u2019 surface affects the tail as the planet rotates. DiBraccio concludes saying, \u201cMars is really complicated but really interesting at the same time\u201d. ALSO READ: You may be able to Snapchat on Mars, reveals Elon Musk.

V  KOCHI: Amrita Institute of Medical Science is hosting Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) state task force meeting for tuberculosis of all medical colleges in Kerala on Tuesday. .  TB Control activities of medical colleges will be analysed in the programme. A CME will be organised as part of the state task force meeting and assessment of the TB Control activities will be done. After delay of almost a year, this year, the state government rolled out the daily drug regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis under RNTCP. .  This is a major shift in the TB treatment policy that has been followed by the Central TB Division since 1997. While patients under RNTCP were being administered drugs thrice a week, the private-sector physicians preferred to put their patients on a daily regimen of tailor-made drug combinations and dosages. The WHO revised its TB management guidelines in 2010, recommending that the daily drug regimen be adopted under RNTCP. .

V Women who did not have anaesthesia may have been at an increased risk for PPD because the labour pain may have been traumatising to the women during delivery. (Photo: Pixabay). Washington DC: Mothers-to-be, please-take-note! Women who give birth in winter or spring are less likely to suffer from postpartum depression (PPD) than women who deliver babies summer, suggests a recent study. The findings indicated that women delivering in winter and spring may be attributed to the seasonal enjoyment of indoor activities. Factors affecting the risk of postnatal depression, also known as postpartum depression (PPD), included the length of pregnancy, whether or not an epidural was given during delivery and body mass index. At least 10 percent of women experience some degree of anxiety or depression after giving birth. Symptoms include sadness, restlessness, and lack of concentration. PPD typically arises from a combination of hormonal changes, psychological adjustments to motherhood and fatigue, said US researchers. They also found that women, who delivered babies at a higher gestational age (further along in their pregnancy), were less likely to develop PPD and women who did not have anaesthesia, such as an epidural, during delivery had an increased risk. The authors said women who did not have anaesthesia may have been at an increased risk for PPD because the labour pain may have been traumatising to the women during delivery, or it's possible those who declined anaesthesia just happened to have intrinsic characteristics that made them more vulnerable to experiencing PPD. Caucasian women had a lower risk of PPD compared to women of other races. Additionally, increased body mass index (BMI) was also associated with an increased risk of PPD. The team analysed 20,169 women who delivered babies from June 2015 through August 2017. A total of 817 (4.1 percent) women experienced PPD. "It is expected that the mother will do better and be less mentally stressed when delivering a mature, healthy baby," Dr Zhou noted. The research is being presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY 2017 annual meeting in Boston.

VArt & Culture. Artistes enact a play, \u201cKanak di Balli\u201d, at Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh, on Tuesday. RAVI KUMAR. Our Correspondent. Chandigarh, October 24. After credible performances of Hindi theatre, the Alankar theatre group ventured to maintain their excellence in classic Punjabi dramas with two shows of a play \u2018Kanak di Balli\u2019 at the mini auditorium of Tagore Theatre here today. The play, based on a book by novelist and thespian Balwant Gargi, is a sordid story of true love, repressed desires and dreams of Taro and Bachna who fall victim to the oppressive and malicious attitude of land lord Maggar Singh. Both are subjected to all sorts of torment and victimisation. In the process, the inherent tendencies of avarice, decadence and degeneration of ethics and human values is revealed. .  The use of original Malvai dialect used in the book and improvement in the roles of protagonists was impressive. The musical renditions and vibrant folk dances, besides stage craft and lights , remained lifeline of the play.

VBuchanan, Grand Bassa County - Over 100 school-going children at the Advent Christian Primary School in Kpandy Town, outside Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, have benefited from a donation of book bags and copybooks from a group call Local Initiative. The bags and books were distributed to the kids Friday, October 20, 2017, on the school campus. Mark Thompson, chief executive officer of Local Initiative, said his group believes in helping the needed. \u201cThe bags and books are meant to augment what the kids already have,\u201d Thompson further stated; adding: "Whenever we leave Liberia, we go and lobby with friends to help the needed.\u201d. He mentioned that Local Initiative chose Advent Christian Primary School because students there were really in need of the items. The school is located in a populated underprivileged community in Kpandy Town, outside Buchanan. The school\u2019s proprietor, Du-Ben Cleon, said they started the school as a study class for kids between ages four to eight as means of keeping them up. Cleon further stated that there was no school for the bigger boys and girls in the community so he decided to turn the study class into a community school due to the huge number of children he had attending the study class. "I opened this school this year. I have over 250 students but there is no money to keep teachers in the school; we are all volunteering," Cleon added. "We have not even found a uniform for the kids to use. Parents are really sending their children," he stated. He was very grateful for the bags and copybooks as they will help most of the students because their parents cannot even afford to buy copybooks for their kids. "Sometimes I can use my own money to get copybooks for these students but thank God for Local Initiative\u2019s intervention," Cleon added. A member of the community, Marpue Kpue, happily thanked Local Initiative for helping their children. "For me, I have no money to buy bags and copy books for my children. Thank God for this group that has come to help our children," Ms. Kpue, a parent, said. Another community member, Joseph Jimmy, expressed his joy to Local Initiative for the gesture.

VSo what was the secret of Brazil's effervescent come-from-behind 2-1 victory over a resilient Germany in the quarter-final of the FIFA U-17 World Cup?. According to Brazil coach Carlos Amadeu, some key strategic changes did the trick. The German coach (Christian Wueck) did a good strategy and blocked Brazil midfielders. He neutralised their offensive system. This caused some problem. The left-back (Luan Candido) was playing his first game in this competition. The German coach knew that and wanted to use that to win,' Amadeu said at the post match press conference. In the second half, Brazil substituted and brought in Weverson. The midfielders played as wingers and the left back and right back went into the middle. The forwards were penetrating inside Germany's defence which confused the rivals. The three-time champions Brazil rallied to overturn Jann-Fiete Arp's 21st minute lead through substitute Weverson (71st) and Paulinho (77th) second-half goals to set up a semi-final clash with England on Wednesday. Germans were brilliant till the 71st minute. At half-time, Amadeu took off Candido who had before this game played for a few minutes in two games for the Selecao boys, bringing on the hugely effective Weverson who turned the tide of the tie. Germany coach Christian Wueck on Sunday came down heavily on US referee Jair Marrufo saying he made the difference in the 1-2 result against Brazil which knocked them out of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in a quarterfinal tie. Asked about the German coach's reaction, Brazil counterpart Carlos Amadeu said it was not on his part to comment on the referee. We have won fairplay award in U-15 and U-17 championships. If someone has done something like this, we will talk to the player. We have only one yellow card going into this match.'.

VPhoto by Kimberley Ross. A new festival is coming to London next summer, with The xx and The National already queued up to play the 10-day event. The new fest will take place in Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, with a three-day music festival, three "huge standalone headline shows", and "free to access" midweek programme (featuring film, spots, education, wellbeing, food, drink, comedy, and more) focused on the local community. The xx will play during the festival weekend on 26 May with Lykke Li and Popcaan, and many more names - "over 200", apparently - are set to be announced in the coming months. The National will hit the park for the first of three 'APE Presents...' standalone shows - they play 2 June with The War On Drugs, Future Islands, Warpaint, and The Districts (more names TBC). "After a thrilling four sold out shows at the Eventim Apollo in September, we are excited to take over Victoria Park next summer," say The National in a statement. "We are already thinking about ways to make this more than just a show...". The full festival takes place 25 May-3 June 2018, and is presented by AEG/Goldenvoice. "The council is pleased to be working with AEG, who were selected following a rigorous procurement process to deliver some exciting events in 2018 which can be enjoyed by local people, Londoners, and visitors from across the UK," says Tower Hamlets mayor John Biggs. This new fest means that Field Day - who've long had Victoria Park for at least part of the new All Points East dates - will be "Upping Sticks". Find out more on Facebook.

V The two member bench had asked for the constitution of family welfare committees for the resolution of matrimonial disputes through discussions and negotiations. (Representational image). Hyderabad: Advocates in the city feel that women cannot be blamed for the alleged misuse of Section 498A of the IPC, which deals with matrimonial cruelty. They say that lapses on the part of enforcement agencies cannot be attributed to women. These advocates were reacting to a directive of a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Mishra which asked for the guidelines issued by a two-member bench of the apex court to be revisited. In July, an apex court bench comprising Justice A.K. Goel and Justice U.U. Lalit had expressed concern over disgruntled wives misusing the anti dowry law to initiate action against their husbands and inlaws. . It had directed that no arrest should be taken on the basis of such complaints without the veracity of allegations being ascertained. The two member bench had asked for the constitution of family welfare committees for the resolution of matrimonial disputes through discussions and negotiations. Chief Justice Dipak Mishra wanted these directives to be revisited. \u201cWe are not in agreement with the judgement passed in the case. We can\u2019t write the law. We can only interpret the law,\u201d he said. Women advocates practising at the Hyderabad High Court were of the opinion that the court should direct its anger towards law enforcement agencies, and not women. Advocate Rachana Waddepalli said that as per the criminal laws, an arrest was not compulsory. \u201cThe police must investigate the matter and then register a complaint under the sections they deem fit,\u201d she said. \u201cIn most dowry harassment cases, the investigating officers arrest the accused without verifying the facts of the case and the evidence, and this has resulted in women being blamed,\u201d Ms Waddepalli added. . Advocate Aruna Koppaka said that in a patriarchal society, Section 498-A brought respite to women who were subjected to violence. \u201cIn a majority of cases, newly-wed couples live in joint families. Whenever a bride is tortured or if she is thrown out of her matrimonial home, she is left with no option but to resort to legal action against her in-laws, who often connive with their son.\u201d. Advocate M.V. Madhurima said Section 498A was a powerful provision. She said disallowing the police to arrest the accused whenever they feel that custodial interrogation is necessary or if there is a possibility of evidence being tampered with, and handing over the responsibility of deciding whether an offence has occurred or not to welfare committees will defeat its purpose. .

VChitrakoot (Uttar Pradesh) [India]: On the second day of Chitrakoot visit, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said his government will aim to provide all services to the pilgrims and tourists visiting the temple town. "We will try to provide more and more facilities to our pilgrims, including a ropeway on Lakshman Mountain. We will begin our 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' here and try to live up to the expectations of masses,\u201d Saffron leader Yogi said. "We will embrace meetings with elected representatives, administration officials to evaluate development projects and law and order. We will also give out certificates to beneficiaries of welfare schemes and address the public," Yogi further added. Before, the Chief Minister carried out an aarti at the Kamtanath temple separately from participating in a five-kilometer long 'parikrama' around the Kamadgiri Mountain. "This journey has generated affirmative energy and brought me closer to nature. Nature is the best gift that almighty gave us so we should preserve and protect it,\u201d CMYogi asserted. "We must respect our holy rivers and perform 'parikrama' of our mountains and forests to preserve our culture,"Yogi further added.

VGoogle\u2019s Chrome Dev Summit is usually the site of big announcements regarding the browser, and this year is no different, with the announcement of a new Android app integration option called Trusted Web Activities. Somewhat akin to Android Instant Apps, this new facet of Chrome is meant to make apps quicker and less resource-draining on users, and easier to create and maintain for developers. Rather than offloading and serving an app on the server side of things, it allows developers to direct users\u2019 devices to full-screen web content experiences in Chrome, expanding the ways a developer can create and serve an app or game, and giving app installations on devices a smaller footprint. As a bonus, Google also announced the Chrome User Experience Report, which will tell developers how well users\u2019 devices have handled the content on their website, with real-time performance metrics aggregated from multiple visitors and device types. Trusted Web Activities, in short, allows developers to leverage Chrome\u2019s built-in rendering engine to process and serve content, rather than having to use built-in Android ones or code their own. Additionally, it allows seamless integration of high-level web content into an Android app, allowing developers to craft experiences that seamlessly go back and forth between the native app and web app. On a good connection, this can provide a premium user experience, such as a VR app or graphically intensive game, without requiring users to install a large app on their device. Additionally, switching between web and native interfaces can make it easy to natively code certain parts of the app and have them interact with the web interface. A good example of this would be a VR shooting game powered by WebVR, with a native app as the container, and a native component to the app that powers user rankings, scoreboard, and the player customization panel. The move is part of an ongoing convergence effort on Google\u2019s part. The web giant is seemingly trying to unite web content and native device content, with the apparent endgame of high-level, device-agnostic web content becoming the norm, with native apps serving only as the containers. With powerful 5G connections on the horizon and smartphones quickly approaching the power level of the average laptop, the stage is seemingly set for Google and others to fulfill such a vision.

VNo matter what your skin care problem might be, there's an essential oil to treat it. When trouble strikes your skin, turn to a natural essential oil. In recent times, a greasy revolution is underway as oil has found its place in our beauty cabinets. From being infused in our makeup to being mixed in our serums, beauty oils are now available in every form. They originate from numerous ingredients and can treat many skin care problems. Here's how these 6 essential oils can treat some of your beauty problems. Before you begin, always do a test patch for essential oils on your wrist or neck to ensure that your skin won't react to it. 1. Discolouration . For the childhood scar that never quite faded or stubborn dark spots that just won't budge, rose hip oil is your answer. It boosts the regenerative powers of skin cells to fade scars, spots and discolouration. Bonus - rose hip oil is also a celebrity pick that is favoured by the likes of Miranda Kerr and Kate Middleton!. 2. Pimples . To get rid of those active pimples that turn up without prior notice, choose tea tree oil. With its Australian origins, tea tree oil contains powerful antibacterial and antifungal agents, which combat pimple-causing bacteria from its very root. 3. Dryness . The best bet for flaky, dry skin is nothing but argan oil because it is rich in Vitamin E and essential fatty acids. Together, this combination helps moisturise even the driest skin intensely. So as a result, the face is left hydrated and healthy. 4. Irritation . For times when your skin feels itchy, red or bumpy, chamomile oil is your go-to solution. Just as a cup of chamomile tea soothes your stomach, its oil equivalent does the same for your face. Chamomile oil is filled with flavonoids which calms irritated skin and soothes redness or bumps. 5. Excessive Oiliness . It may sound counterintuitive to apply oil to treat oiliness, but hear us out. Grapeseed oil regulates sebum production and reduces clogged pores within the skin. It also gets absorbed quickly without leaving a greasy film of oil, which is exactly what every oily skinned girl longs for. 6. Ageing. When crow's feet and wrinkles start to appear, turn to ylang ylang. Originating from the yellow flowered tropical tree, ylang ylang has a delicate floral smell that's known to be stress reductive. Ylang ylang promotes skin elasticity by encouraging quick cell regeneration, thus, reducing signs of ageing.

VTorrential rains and strong winds from Typhoon Lan's passage across Japan on Monday caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closing of highways. Typhoon Lan, the 21st of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, landed in the eastern prefecture of Shizuoka at around 3 a.m. local time with wind gusts of up to 200 km per hour, according to Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Efe news reported. Two major Japanese airlines - Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) - cancelled about 170 domestic and international flights scheduled for Monday, which affected around 43,000 passengers. The high-speed train service Tokaido Shinkansen line - linking Tokyo with the west of the country - was interrupted and different sections of highways have been cut on the main island of Honshu. Heavy rainfall caused by Typhoon Lan on Sunday mainly affected the western end of the country, where two people were killed in Fukuoka and Yamaguchi prefectures. According to the public broadcaster NHK, one person reportedly went missing in Wakayama after a house was buried by a landslide and around 89 were injured. Evacuation orders were declared in hundreds of localities on Honshu Island and the residents in nearly 200 towns were advised to take refuge in the municipal shelters. According to the JMA, Typhoon Lan, after crossing north of Tokyo and Chiba prefecture at 9.45 a.m. local time, is now over the Pacific again, about 80 km from the coastal town of Iwaki (about 170 km northeast of the Japanese capital) and still maintains winds of about 160 km per hour. Typhoon Lan will affect the eastern fringe of Hokkaido Island in the next few hours while progressively weakening, expects the JMA.

VTyphoon Lan smashes Japan, heads out to sea. Tokyo (CNN)At least two people died as mammoth Typhoon Lan struck Japan early Monday, bringing widespread flooding and setting off mudslides before heading out to sea. Lan brought high winds and heavy rain as it made landfall around 3 a.m. local time on the Pacific coast of central Japan, the Kyodo News service reported. Rivers burst their banks in several parts of the country, flooding streets. Video from Japan's public broadcaster NHK shows collapsed roads and homes engulfed by a massive mudslide. Kyodo reports that Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways canceled over 100 flights Monday, affecting over 25,000 passengers. Lan was whipping sustained winds of 165 kph (100 mph) early Monday, according to CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink. . The system will weaken slowly as it tracks quickly to the northeast into the Northwestern Pacific; but will sustain tropical storm force winds of 90-110 kph (57-70 mph) over the next 24 hours, Brink said. The season's 21st typhoon brought heavy rainfall over much of Japan. . Shingu had received nearly 900 millimeters (35 inches) of rainfall since Friday -- over 500 millimeters (19 inches) falling in just 24 hours, Brink said. . Ahead of the storm, more than 200,000 people had been ordered to evacuate, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, with a further 2.2 million homes under advisory to prepare for evacuation. . In Fukuoka, a city on the southern island prefecture of Kyushu, a 63-year-old man died when falling construction scaffolding struck him, police in the city told CNN. . Police in Osaka, in central Japan, said a woman was found dead in a flooded car in the city, though they could not immediately be certain the incident was related to the typhoon. . The storm had already caused massive waves in South Korea. . Typhoon Lan is so enormous that its cloud field is larger than Japan, Brink said. . On Sunday, Japanese voters participated in a snap general election that put Shinzo Abe on course to become the longest-serving leader in the country's post-war history. The turnout Sunday was hit by the typhoon, but a record number of Japanese citizens had voted early. . Journalist Kaori Enjoji in Tokyo contributed to this report. .

V Find out on the latest episode of Ignition .  Find out on the latest episode of Ignition . Even if you \u201conly\u201d get the plain old base model, there isn\u2019t really anything the Pagani Huayra lacks. It\u2019s a powerful, rare exotic that\u2019s as much a rolling piece of artwork as it is a performance car. But for buyers who want one that\u2019s a little better suited for track use, Pagani recently introduced the Huayra BC. Named for Horacio Pagani\u2019s close friend and first customer, Benny Caiola, the Huayra BC is lighter, more powerful, and more track-focused than the regular Huayra, featuring extreme active aerodynamics, suspension, braking, and tire technology. But no matter how much Pagani improves the Huayra\u2019s performance, the iconic Zonda is still out there, casting a long shadow over its successor. After all, it\u2019s hard to displace a legend in people\u2019s hearts. If any version of the Huayra could do that, however, it will be the BC. The question is, can it? To figure that out, our own Jethro Bovingdon hops behind the wheel to push Pagani\u2019s limited-edition hypercar to its limits. To begin, Bovingdon heads to Pagani HQ to take a behind-the-scenes look at the engineering that went into the Huayra BC. Eventually, though, it\u2019s time to take the car for a drive. And what better place is there to start than the back roads of rural Italy? If the Huayra BC has the same kind of character that made the Zonda so special, you can bet it will come out on a winding, empty country road. Then it\u2019s time to head to the supercar\u2019s natural habitat: the race track. Located south-east of Milan, the Autodromo di Franciacorta gives Bovingdon the chance to see how the Huayra BC drives when it\u2019s pushed far harder than you could ever safely do on a public road. At the end of it all, does the ultra-exclusive Pagani Huayra BC manage to win Bovingdon over, or does he still long for the Zonda and its 7.3-liter naturally aspirated V-12? Watch the whole episode below to find out!.

VBrace yourself for this news, pickle-lovers. There's a new snack coming your way that's going to change the way you think about pickles and fruit punch. Tropickles, aka tropical-fruit-punch-flavored pickles \u2014 get it? \u2014 have just launched exclusively at Walmart under the Great Value brand. And they're exactly what they sound (and look) like: your standard jar of cucumber pickles with a not-so-standard color and flavor thanks to the red fruit punch that they're soaking in. While Walmart is the first store to launch an official Tropickle product, the company's spokespeople admit they're not the first to think of the idea. People have been making different versions of fruit-punch pickles (like Kool-Aid pickles) for years, predominantly in the South. And Walmart claims to have learned of the idea through social media. In a statement, Walmart said, "The modern-day couple, the pickle and fruit punch met on social media (they bonded over recipes on Pinterest, to be exact); now, we are celebrating their union on Walmart store shelves." It makes sense that the jars of Tropickles ($2) are not available at all Walmart stores, but at a select 1,400 stores predominantly in the South. . For those of you who have yet to experience such a fruity pickle, here's a quick rundown of what to expect based on our own taste test. POPSUGAR tried the pickles ahead of the launch, and our editors can confirm that Tropickles taste just as equally sweet and tangy as you'd imagine. Less acidic and much more sugary than a regular pickle, the Tropickles' flavor hits your mouth all at once upon your first bite. The fruit punch makes them seem even juicier, and there's no shortage of a tropical aftertaste. If you're an adventurous eater who loves both salty pickles and sweet fruit punch, you just might be surprised by how much you love this unexpected combo. . These babies arrived on store shelves on July 14, so keep your eyes peeled the next time you're grocery shopping at Walmart.

VTOKYO: A rapidly weakening typhoon Lan made landfall in Japan on Monday, setting off landslides and flooding but leaving the capital, Tokyo, largely unscathed, although at least two people were reported killed and train and plane services disrupted. It had weakened to a category 2 storm when it made landfall early on Monday, sideswiping Tokyo, after it had powered north for days as an intense category 4 storm, according to the Tropical Storm Risk monitoring site. Lan is the Marshall islands word for "storm". At least two people were killed, one a man in his 60s who was passing a building site when scaffolding collapsed on top of him and the other a fisherman tending to his boat, Kyodo news agency said. Nearly 90 others suffered injuries, most of them minor, media reported. Another man was missing after a landslide engulfed his home, NHK public television said, although his wife was dug out by rescuers. Rivers burst their banks in several parts of Japan and fishing boats were tossed up on land. A container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbour wall but all 19 crew members escaped injury. The centre of the storm was northeast of Tokyo on Monday morning and it was moving northeast at 65 km/h (40 mph), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It was expected to move out into the Pacific later on Monday and become a tropical depression on Tuesday. Around 350 flights were cancelled and train services disrupted over a wide area, although most commuter trains were running smoothly in Tokyo. Tens of thousands of people were advised to evacuate, and several thousand ordered to move, on Sunday as the storm approached, lashing a wide swath of Japan with torrential rain and wind. Those numbers had fallen sharply by Monday morning. Toyota Motor Corp cancelled the first shift at all of its assembly plants and said that it would decide on a later shift around noon on Monday. \u2014Reuters.

VGNOME developer Javier Jardn is kicking off the development of the GNOME 3.28 desktop environment with the first snapshot, GNOME 3.27.1, which is now available for public testing.  With a three-day delay, the GNOME 3.27.1 milestone has been released this past weekend for early adopters to give us a first glimpse of what's coming to the GNOME 3.28 desktop environment, due for release on March 14, 2018. The focus for this release has been on porting more apps to the Meson build system.  "GNOME 3.27.1, the first unstable release in the 3.28 development cycle, is now available. The porting of more modules to meson continues (which is great!), but It's still causing some problems for some modules," said Javier Jardn. "If you want to compile GNOME 3.27.1 by yourself, you can use the JHBuild modulesets.  Not so many apps and core components are included in the GNOME 3.27.1, which comes with new versions of the GNOME Builder, Evolution, Epiphany, Baobab, GTK+, Mutter, GNOME Shell, Simple Scan, Yelp, Disks, Logs, Maps, Calendar, Boxes, Clocks, Online Accounts GVFS, and dconf-editor.GNOME 3.27.2 coming November 15 with more improvementsAs usual, you can check the release notes here and here if you're curious to know what exactly was fixed or added in each of these apps, and you can compile and install the GNOME 3.27.1 release on your favorite GNU/Linux distribution using the JHBuild modulesets available at https://download.gnome.org/teams/releng/3.27.1/.  The development cycle of the GNOME 3.28 desktop environment will continue next month with the second snapshot, GNOME 3.27.2, which is expected to land on November 15, according to the official release schedule. Of course, this will bring more improvements to your favorite GNOME apps and components.  For the GNOME 3.28 desktop environment, the development team plans on introducing a new app called GNOME Usage, which can show the current resource usage of your GNU/Linux operating system, implement a sharing framework with support for portals, as well as a brand-new on-screen keyboard. .

VCertain schools in the US are receiving threatening messages from hackers in exchange of destroying stolen data.  Dark Overlord\u2019 is a group of hackers who already tried and were successful in hacking Netflix\u2019s production studio servers a while ago. (Representative Image). In the latest incident involving the matter of cybersecurity, CNN Tech has reported that hackers are now trying to use personal details of students and teachers, and using them to gain ransom. The incident has taken place in Montana school district along with several other areas in the United States. Superintendent Steve Bradshaw reported the matter to the police after he received threatening text messages on his cell phone. "The messages weren't pleasant messages," Bradshaw said. "They were 'splatter kids' blood in the hallways,' and things like that." The issue seems to be a serious one as the US Department of Education has issued a warning to parents, teachers and students about a severe cyber threat looming over the schools of the country. Hackers have started targeting schools in a bid to ask for a ransom and are resorting to all sorts of ways to get their demands met. They are stealing student and staff records from the computer database and then using it to send threatening messages to people. When receiving any sort of request, they are sending out demands for ransom in exchange of the stolen data. In a ransom note sent to a number of Columbia Falls school district members, the hacking group called the \u2018Dark Overlord\u2019 demanded up to $150,000 in bitcoin to destroy the stolen private data. The ransom note also contained several violent phrases to threaten the people; some parts of it mentioning threats of bullying, shaming or even violence. \u2018Dark Overlord\u2019 is a group of hackers who already tried and were successful in hacking Netflix\u2019s production studio servers a while ago. There\u2019s no mention as to why the group has suddenly taken to hacking school databases and threatening students as well as staff. It could be that they take the school crowd to be easily exploitable instead of financial institutions. While the US authorities are on the issue and will protect the concerned schools from the attack, it also gives us an example to protect school databases in our country. Data security in most Indian schools and colleges are taken lightly, with no major security firewall built in. If there\u2019s anything Indian authorities have learnt from the WannaCry attack earlier this year, then it\u2019s about time to implement them for a secure computing environment.

V India batsman Dinesh Karthik feels the kind of challenge that young wrist spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal faced against New Zealand in the first ODI will make them "mentally tougher" for future games.  Tom Latham (103) and Ross Taylor (95) added 200 runs in New Zealand's successful 281-run chase during which the spin twins hardly troubled the duo. "These are the kind of games which makes you mentally tougher as a bowler. These are the kind of games which are going to help them to stand up to pressure and learn how to handle pressure when the wicket is not so much helping them," Karthik said at the post-match media conference.  Kuldeep and Chahal have been instrumental in India's success and Karthik feels that their self belief gives team management the confidence and one off day will not matter much in the longer run. "The team management backed them a lot and they believe in themselves. They are two young guys and they have produced some fantastic spells in the last series and I am sure their confidence is sky high. One game here and there, doesn't not make you a bad bowler," said Karthik.  Like his skipper Virat Kohli, the Tamil Nadu batsman was full of praise for Taylor and Latham, who stood out in testing conditions scripting a near flawless run-chase. "Credit to Tom Latham and Ross Taylor. They batted really well. They made use of the conditions and played some good shots. They used the sweep to some good effect," Karthik observed.  Karthik, who looked good during his knock of 37 off 47 deliveries admitted that he should have converted the start.  "There are two ways to look at it. It was a decent start. Having said that, a player like me should have tried and batted a little longer. And that is something, I am disappointed about. I could have batted a little more and we would have probably ended up getting 15-20 runs more towards the end. May be, I got out at a critical time in the game. So pretty disappointed with that aspect but it was decent start and good to have that partnership with Virat," Karthik added.

VNow, pet stores can only sell rescue animals. Animal lovers, rejoice: California has officially become the first state to ban sales from puppy mills. Under the new law, pet store owners will be required to work with local shelters and rescue groups to sell dogs, cats and rabbits. The legislation \u2014 which will be enforced beginning January 1, 2019 \u2014 has gathered much support from animal activist groups, including the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They believe it promotes more pet adoption from shelters and will significantly decrease the amount of animals euthanized there. Currently, an estimated 1.5 million animals are put down in shelters across the United States a year and approximately 99% of dogs sold in pet stores nationwide come from puppy mills.  Happy #NationalRelaxationDay!!#chillin\U0001f44c\U0001f436\U0001f43e. A post shared by humanesociety (@humanesociety) on Aug 15, 2017 at 9:41am PDT. Opponents of the bill \u2014 mainly, pet store owners \u2013 fear that it will limit consumers in their access to popular animal breeds. They also note that the medical history of animals in shelters is not always known, therefore causing a potential risk to the prospective owner. The law, however, will still allow people to buy animals directly from private breeders.  Happy #NationalPuppyDay from these two Puerto Rican cuties!!! \U0001f499\U0001f436\U0001f43e\U0001f436\U0001f499 Thanks to generous supporters, these little heartthrobs hitched a ride with HSUS to their forever homes through our #HumanePuertoRico initiatives \U0001f495\U0001f495 Interested in adopting a Puerto Rican pup in need?? Check out the #linkinbio to learn more about our Sister Shelter Project & the incredible shelters participating! #adoptdontshop #shelterpetsrock. A post shared by humanesociety (@humanesociety) on Mar 23, 2017 at 9:12am PDT. While the legislation is definitely a victory in cracking down on the cruel practices of puppy mills, the problem still remains widespread. According to the Humane Society, there are still at least 10,000 puppy mills across the U.S., many of which are not regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Only time will tell whether the law will help lower those numbers. Here's to hoping it does and that others soon follow in California's footsteps ... er, paw tracks.

V (CNN)Former astronaut Paul Weitz, who commanded the maiden voyage of the space shuttle Challenger, has died, according to NASA. He was 85. . Weitz, who was an astronaut for 28 years and logged more than 790 hours in space, had battled cancer, a NASA spokesperson said. The cause of his death Monday has not been disclosed. "We're saddened by the loss of retired astronaut Paul Weitz," NASA said in a statement Tuesday. The Pennsylvania native was one of 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as the pilot on the Skylab 2 mission that launched in May 1973. The 28-day flight established what was then a world record for a single mission, according to NASA. After working with NASA for 22 years, Weitz retired in July 1976 and returned to the Navy. He would later rejoin NASA. "He was a pioneer. He came out of retirement to fly and that was not commonplace at the time that he did," said Tammy Sudler, president and CEO of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. "So even amongst astronauts, even with people who are in the space community, he is known as one of the good guys." . Led first Challenger crew. Weitz commanded the Challenger when it was launched on April 4, 1983. The Challenger was lost when it exploded shortly after launch in January 1986, killing seven crew members. . Weitz became deputy director of the Johnson Space Center before his final retirement in 1994. He received multiple awards, including the NASA Distinguished Service and NASA Space Flight medals. Curtis Brown, a former astronaut and current board chairman of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, said Weitz proved that age was merely a number when he came out of retirement to serve on the Challenger when he was almost 51. "Paul Weitz's name will always be synonymous with the space shuttle Challenger. But he also will be remembered for defying the laws of gravity -- and age.". Weitz lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, at the time of his death.

VPhobos, one of the moons of Mars is considered a strong candidate as a staging area for future missions to Mars. The significantly lower gravity on Phobos as compared to the Red Planet makes it easier for spacecraft to land and take off. Spacefarers on Phobos could control robotic probes and rovers on the Martian surface, without the significant delay of transmitting signals back and forth from Earth. New research by NASA suggests that powerful outbursts from the Sun could electrically charge the moons of Phobos, introducing complexities to any future planned missions. Phobos as imaged by the MRO.

The charge would build up on the night side of Phobos, facing the surface of the Red Planet, a potential site for future manned missions to establish a command and control center for robotic exploration of the Martian surface. The charge is expected to build up during regular solar activity, but is expected to be particularly severe after excessive solar activity such as coronal mass ejections. The study was a follow up on previous researchers into the build up of electric charges in the craters of the Earth's Moon, as well as the dark areas on asteroids. William Farrell, from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the study says, "We found that astronauts or rovers could accumulate significant electric charges when traversing the night side of Phobos \u2013 the side facing Mars during the Martian day. While we don\u2019t expect these charges to be large enough to injure an astronaut, they are potentially large enough to affect sensitive equipment, so we would need to design spacesuits and equipment that minimizes any charging hazard." The research has been published in Advances in Space Research. The study focused on Phobos, but the same conditions are expected to affect the other moon of Mars, Deimos in a similar manner. Calculations showed that in teflon spacesuits such as the ones used by NASA astronauts on the Apollo missions to the Moon, the buildup of static charge can reach ten thousand volts. After the charge has been accumulated, it can discharge into any electrical instruments touched by the astronaut, leading to damage of the equipment.

VAndy Rubin\u2019s Essential Phone   has received a massive price cut just two months after it started shipping.   The device was billed as a top contender to iPhone X when it made its debut in May. But supposedly weak demand has forced Essential to slash $200 off its price tag already. The Essential Phone gets a lot of things right. Its stunning design, with titanium, ceramic, and an edge-to-edge display, is one of the prettiest we\u2019ve seen this year. Its software is near pure Android without any nasty bloatware. Its specifications are the best available today.  But it also gets a lot wrong. It was very expensive when it made its debut, and if you want to buy it through a carrier, your only option is Sprint. Essential missed its initial shipping deadline, forcing customers to wait longer than originally promised for delivery. These things seem to have killed demand for the first smartphone from Android co-creator Andy Rubin. In an effort to change that, Essential has slashed $200 off its price tag.  Essential Phone now starts at $499.   You can now buy the Essential Phone directly from Essential in either black moon or pure white for $499. That\u2019s for an unlocked handset that will work on any carrier in the U.S. (and most other countries), with 128GB of storage as standard. It suddenly makes the Essential Phone an incredibly appealing flagship \u2014 especially if you\u2019re into Android. It\u2019s half the price of iPhone X, looks almost as good, and has the specifications needed to go head-to-head with any other Android on the market. Apple had to do the same. You may remember that Apple had to make a similar move with the original iPhone. Its high price tag was stumping demand following its big debut, so Apple slashed $200 off just two months after introducing it. This made a lot of early adopters, who had already forked out $599, incredibly unhappy. Apple attempted to appease them with a $100 bill credit, but of course, this didn\u2019t please everyone. Essential is taking similar steps same by offering early customers $200 in store credit which can be used against the purchase of another Phone or accessories. That means you could now get a second handset for a friend for as little as $299. .

V(PTI Photo).  NEW DELHI: Former India captain and current Under-19 cricket team coach Rahul Dravid on Tuesday downplayed speculations over Virat Kohli being denied rest during the Test series against Sri Lanka next month. .  Kohli had recently spoken about players' burnout due to constant cricket and there were rumours that he may be rested for the whole of Sri Lankan series in order to keep him fresh for the tour of South Africa which starts on December 30. .  The first India vs Sri Lanka Test starts from November 16 in Kolkata while Nagpur and Delhi will host the second and third Tests respectively before the sides play three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and a same number of Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). .  "Rotations are needed. There are a lot of matches being played, so you need to rotate the players. I think the management is taking right decision (in terms of rotating the players)," Dravid said on the sidelines of FICCI's felicitation programmes for women cricketers Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami. .  "Everyone needs rest. He (Kohli) will get rest when he wants. When and which series (Kohli will take) rest will be decided by the team management, physios and physical trainers (after discussing with the player). Probably currently he doesn't need rest. He may be rested later. I don't know why there is so much of discussion and controversy," he added. .  Dravid was asked about International Cricket Council (ICC)'s latest decisions on limiting the size of the bats. .  According to the ICC, though the restriction on the length and width of bats remain unchanged, the thickness of the edges can't be more than 40mm and the overall depth can be 67 mm at the most. .  Dravid felt the new rule will not make a big impact to balance the power of bat and ball unless sporting pitches were laid out. .  "It is a good decision though the change isn't very drastic as only a few players use bats which do not come under new rules. It is the quality pitch and ground which matter in cricket (more than the bat)," said Dravid, who has more than 24,000 runs in international cricket. .  Dravid also gave the thumbs-up to ICC's decision to roll out a league each for One-Day Internationals and Tests. .  "The leagues will generate more interest and context to the bilateral series," he said. .

VDuchamp\u2019s version of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was one of nine works in the sale by the French artist, who is seen as the father of conceptual art. One of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s reproductions of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d, on to which he pencilled a beard and moustache, has sold for 632,500 euros ($750,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in Paris. It was part of the sale of a collection of surrealist works owned by American Arthur Brandt, with 110 pieces fetching 3.9 million euros, including commission. However, some standout pieces, including a work by Francis Picabia, which was estimated at 700,000 euros, did not find a buyer. Duchamp\u2019s version of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was one of nine works in the sale by the French artist, who is seen as the father of conceptual art. The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d works are entitled \u201cL.H.O.O.Q\u201d, which in French sounds like the phrase \u201celle a chaud au cul\u201d, roughly translated as \u201cshe\u2019s horny\u201d. It had a pre-sale estimate of 400,000 to 600,000 euros. The version that sold late Saturday was created in 1964 after the original 1919 so-called \u201cready made\u201d piece. The other Duchamp pieces on offer at the auction included \u201cBoite-en-valise\u201d or \u201cBox in a Suitcase\u201d, which beat its pre-sale estimate of 180,000 to 250,000 euros, selling for 319,500 euros. The work is a portable museum featuring 68 of the artist\u2019s most famous works, reproduced or miniaturised. Seven distinct versions were made in limited edition between 1941 and 1966. A painting by Swiss artist Kurt Seligmann called \u201cBuste d\u2019homme\u201d, estimated at 60,000 to 80,000 euros, was sold for 181,250 euros, \u201cnot far from a world record for the artist\u201d, according to Sotheby\u2019s.  Among the six pieces offered from artist and photographer Man Ray, \u201cThe Lovers\u201d, a set of lips engraved in lead and then painted, accompanied by a rope, sold for 81,250 euros, far above the upper pre-sale estimate of 25,000 euros.

VSehore (MP): A tiger mauled to death a 10-year-old girl at a village near the Ratapani wildlife sanctuary here, a forest official said on Monday. The girl along with her two younger siblings had taken their cattle for grazing to a forest adjoining Khanabad village, located in the buffer zone of Ratapani sanctuary, when the feline attacked her on Monday, the forest department's sub-divisional officer, Manoj Bhadoriya, said. Representational image. "As per the information, the tiger pounced on the girl, a class 5 student, killing her on the spot near the village panchayat office," he said. The girl's younger brother and sister made an attempt to save her by throwing stones at the carnivore, but in vain, he said.  As the siblings started screaming, the tiger left the girl and went away from there. The girl's siblings took the body to their village and informed the villagers. Later, the villagers informed the forest department and the police about the incident.  "This is the first such incident reported from this area. The teams of forest department have started a search for the tiger. We have told the villagers to avoid taking cattle into the deep forest areas," Bhadoriya said.  Additional Superintendent of Police Avdhesh Pratap Singh said the girl's body was handed over to the family members after the post-mortem. "A case has been registered and further investigation is underway," he said. .

VAfter taking the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 off-roading in both V-6 and turbo-diesel forms, we can attest to its rough-terrain proficiency. It\u2019s looks don\u2019t really match its attitude, however, as it\u2019s basically a regular Colorado with a hood scoop and a front-bumper skid plate. That\u2019s improving at least a bit, however, as Chevrolet has announced the new ZR2 Midnight and Dusk Editions. Making their debut at the 2017 SEMA show in Las Vegas at the end of this month, the Midnight and Dusk will be two of more than 20 production cars, modified customs, and concept vehicles on the Chevy stand. Like GMC\u2019s Elevation Edition or Ram\u2019s Rebel Black or Rolls-Royce\u2019s Black Badge Editions, Chevrolet\u2019s Midnight ZR2 is indeed blacked out. It has black paint, black bow-tie badges, black 17-inch five-spoke wheels, and a black bed cage with LED lights on top. The Dusk Edition has the same accessory items, but it is offered with the option for any of the ZR2\u2019s other exterior colors, which are shades of blue, green, red, light or dark gray, silver, or white. Basically, this is one special edition offered in numerous colors, and General Motors is pretending it\u2019s two. For the purposes of SEMA, Chevy further differentiates the two. The Midnight on the show floor will have the 3.6-liter V-6 and additional accessories such as a bed-mounted spare-tire carrier, a performance air intake and exhaust, and ZR2-stamped floor liners. The Dusk, which is breaking the Labor Day rule and will be dressed in Summit White, will have the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel and a cold-air intake. These special editions do not offer any performance upgrades, but the ZR2 is already highly focused on taming dirt and rocks. It comes equipped with Multimatic DSSV dampers, an off-road suspension, front and rear electronic locking differentials, hill-descent control, and an Autotrac transfer case. It also sits 2.0 inches higher and has a 3.5-inch-wider track than the regular Colorado. They\u2019ll be on display at the SEMA show, which runs from October 31 through November 3, and will be available from Chevrolet dealers starting in November. Either the Dusk or the Midnight package will cost $3425, Chevrolet said.

VSidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinkaran on Monday joined the chorus in favour of Tamil film \u2018Mersal,\u2019 which is facing BJP heat, saying the saffron party\u2019s demand to delete scenes on GST amounted to \u201cinsulting freedom of expression.\u201d. He also questioned the \u201caggressive\u201d posture of BJP national secretary H Raja on this matter. Answering reporters\u2019 queries on the controversy surrounding the Vijay-starrer, Dhinakaran mockingly said the film crew should thank Raja and BJP state president Tamilisai Soundrajan for giving such publicity to the movie. \u201cThe censor board has allowed (the film\u2019s release) and they are now objecting (to certain scenes on GST)... this amounts to insulting freedom of expression,\u201d he said. Dhinakaran said the film has only tried to highlight an issue, Goods and Services Tax, \u201caffecting people.\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Raja is so aggressive. His tone is intimidating. This is a shameful thing for all politicians, including me,\u201d he said. The BJP leaders could have sorted out the issue with the film producers through talks, Dhinakaran added. Diwali release \u201cMersal\u201d has kicked up a row with the BJP taking exception to references on GST in the movie. BJP leaders, including Raja, Tamilisai Soundarajan and Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan have been demanding that the \u201cincorrect\u201d references be deleted from the big-budget flick. However, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, his senior colleague P Chidambaram, DMK working president MK Stalin, veteran star Kamal Haasan, Tamil Film Producers Council, South Indian Artistes\u2019 Association and a host of Tamil cinema industry representatives had supported the film crew on the issue.

While there are some who would love to be a part of it and gain the experience, but there are surely some who are always in for a big NO. Recently when Bigg Boss gave out its wild-card entries, the makers approached Television actor Shakti Arora to enter the show as a wildcard contestant but Shakti Arora straight away turned them down. . Television actor Shakti Arora who is reminisced with his role in \u2018Pavitra Rishta', \u2018Meri Aashiqui Tumse Hi\u2019 and his latest show \u2018Jhalak Dikhlaja\u2019 has not been seen on screen since a while now keeping his fans anxious to see him back on screen. As per sources, Shakti feels that Bigg Boss is not his choice of show and he cannot be dealing with all the politics and negativity. Adding to this shakti also believes that any amount of money paid to him cannot persuade him to be part of the show and take something he doesn't like. .

Excruciatingly, that's how. A recent Facebook post by UK-based massage therapist Hitesh Patel shows just how rough salon life can be on stylists and colorists. (And that's before taking exposure to harsh straightening and coloring chemicals into account.). "Because [they are] spending hours standing on [their] feet rotated forward, whilst holding [a] brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other angle over [their clients' heads] for hours and hours. Your muscles develop and stop holding your skeletal system in an unnatural off central position. So then when you finally do \u2026 put down your crimping equipment [and] try and sit down [in] a natural neutral position it just doesn't work.". To be clear, the horrifying red marks you're looking at in Patel's photos are not from the daily motions of hairstyling \u2014 at least not directly. What you're looking at is the result of gua sha, an instrument-assisted form of massage therapy that works on scar tissue and, according to Patel, stretches muscles and realigns the spine. So while the treatment looks painful, it's what you can't see \u2014 the invisible toll of a hairstylist's day-to-day routine \u2014 that can apparently cause a great deal of discomfort and damage. Noting that it's also fitness instructors, dentists, mechanics and pharmacists who can face similar occupational issues, Patel writes, "Next time you look at your hairdresser and think they have an easy life, think of these pictures and see how much they sacrifice their own health just so your hair can look good!".

VEveryone\u2019s beauty routine is unique, but celebrity makeup secrets are still our guilty pleasure. With glam squads and the newest products at their fingertips, how could we not at least consider their solicited advice? This week, Zendaya and Victoria Beckham are dropping some serious gems and we can\u2019t help but notice just how easy they are to copy. Zendaya was just one year old when Victoria Beckham was catapulted to superstardom with the Spice Girls, yet the two share more in common than ever before. Besides their respective fashion lines (Daya by Zendaya, Victoria Beckham) and makeup collaborations (Zendaya for CoverGirl, Beckham for Estee Lauder), both have established themselves as beauty icons with plenty of advice to boot. For instance, although glam squads keep them red carpet-ready, like us, they can still appreciate a product that does more than one thing. While detailing her beauty routine with \u201cInto the Gloss,\u201d Beckham credited Estee Lauder\u2019s Aura Gloss with simplifying her routine, as well as the dewy makeup look models wore in her Spring 2018 runway show. \u201cIn the show this season, I put it on the lips and on the top of the cheeks of all the models. I also used it on the eyelids to give it a sort of editorial, wet look,\u201d she shared. \u201cIt\u2019s really nourishing, moisturizing, and I like how I can apply my lip liner once I\u2019ve got that on. She also uses the brand\u2019s Morning Aura , a moisturizer and primer, on the top of her cheeks, eyelids, down the center of the nose, and bow of the lip to capture that straight off the runway look without the extra leg work. Zendaya\u2019s secret weapon, the CoverGirl Oh Sugar Lip Balm, is used in a similar way to create a natural tint on her lips and cheeks. She revealed this and more in a recent interview with W Magazine, where she also debunked the myth that water cures every skin concern. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you no doubt, but it will not make all your blemishes disappear overnight, especially for those with problem skin.\u201d. While Beckham\u2019s product recommendations are on the pricier side ($45 and $95), Zendaya\u2019s go-to CoverGirl balm is just $8. The moral of the story is there are plenty of multi-use options, both luxe and budget-friendly, when it comes to applying a makeup look that will deliver a healthy glow in seconds. Take your pick!.

V  Indo-Japanese car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki is expected to launch the next-generation 2018 Ertiga in India by August next year, as reported by Autocar India. Internally codenamed as the \u2018Maruti YHA\u2019, the company has already started testing the car in India. Recently, the first every spy images of the new Maruti MPV (next-gen Ertiga) were spied in Delhi NCR, while new spy images have been spotted this week. Based on the spy images, IAB have come up with an initial rendering of the upcoming Maruti Suzuki Ertiga. Also Read: New Maruti Suzuki Ertiga 2018 Spied; Price in India, Launch Date, Features, Dimensions, Specs.  The 2018 Maruti Suzuki Ertiga will most probably be based on the lightweight HEARTECT platform. Looking at the spy images, it seems that the MPV will be longer and wider in dimensions. The car will get longer rear overhangs, which should result in better legroom from the third-row passengers. Also on offer will be more usable boot space capacity. It is too early to talk about interior space or features on offer, but knowing new generation Maruti Suzuki cars; there shouldn\u2019t be an issue in these departments. Read More: Upcoming New Maruti Suzuki Cars Launching in India in 2017-18; 2018 Swift, S-Cross Petrol, Vitara Brezza Petrol, Ciaz Facelift & Suzuki Vitara.  According to the report, Maruti Suzuki will equip the new Ertiga with the same 1.4-litre K-Series petrol and 1.3-litre DDiS diesel engine options. That said, the in-house developed 1.5-litre diesel engine is said to be in the final stages of testing and will be introduced later on the MPV. Transmission duties will be handled by a 5-speed manual gearbox. However, there is no word on the availability of any automatic transmission. The new-generation Maruti Suzuki Ertiga will compete against the upcoming Mahindra U321 MPV. .

V, also called Eyjafjallajkull, Eyjafjalla volcano, Eyjafjll, or Eyjafjalla Glacier volcano, subglacial volcano, southern Iceland, lying within the country\u2019s East Volcanic Zone. Its name is derived from an Icelandic phrase meaning \u201cthe island\u2019s mountain glacier,\u201d and the volcano itself lies beneath Eyjafjallajkull (Eyjafjalla Glacier). Its highest point rises to 5,466 feet (1,666 metres) above sea level. Volcanoes and glaciers of Iceland. Records kept since Iceland was settled show that Eyjafjallajkull volcano erupted in 920, 1612 or 1613, and 1821\u201323. The latter eruption continued intermittently for nearly 14 months. In all three cases the eruption of Eyjafjallajkull volcano occurred simultaneously with or was shortly followed by the eruption of Katla, a volcano located some 15.5 miles (25 km) to the east. The Eyjafjallajkull eruption of 2010 began in January with the onset of clusters of small earthquakes, and by early March the earthquake activity had increased in intensity and frequency. On March 21, fountains of lava began exiting through a 0.3-mile- (500-metre-) long vent in the ice-free Fimmvrduhls Pass, which separates the Eyjafjallajkull glacier from the larger glacier Mrdalsjkull to the east. On April 14, lava from new fissures surfaced beneath the crater of the glacier-covered summit. The heat from the lava quickly melted and vaporized the glacier ice above. Mud, ice, and meltwater running off the volcano swelled local rivers and streams, especially the Markarfljt glacial river west of the volcano, which flooded farmland and damaged roads. Expanding gases from the rapid vaporization of ice started a series of moderate phreatomagmatic explosions (which result from the contact of water and magma) that sent a plume of steam and ash almost 7 miles (11 km) into the atmosphere. The plume was driven southeast, across the North Atlantic Ocean to northern Europe, by the prevailing winds. Fearing the damage to commercial aircraft and potential loss of life that could result from flying through the ash cloud, many European countries closed their national airspace and grounded flights for several days. Eyjafjallajkull volcano emitting ash into the air over southern Iceland, April 16, 2010. Plume from Eyjafjallajkull volcano (tan streak) moving southeast over the North Atlantic \u2026.  John P.

VCollege is the time for late-night study-break burgers with your suitemates, loaded deli sandwiches, and endless french fries. But, these days, universities are implementing everything from on-campus farmers markets to aquaponics systems (designed by college alums, of course), as collegiate reputations are going from kegs of lager to bushels of kale. Many universities are now committed to providing better options in dining halls, not to mention sustainability programs, on-site farms, and cows you can pet before you taste their fresh, grassy milk. Here are seven of our favorite healthyish college dining programs. 1. Sterling College, Craftsbury Common, VT. Photo courtesy of @TheSterlingKitchen.  Laugh about Vermont\u2019s hippie rep all you want, but our friends in the Green Mountain State are onto something. Sterling College doesn\u2019t have any food courts or fast food joints on campus. Instead, it manages its food system from seed to compost. All students have to put in one week of dish duty each semester (trust us, your twentysomething, studio-apartment-dwelling self will be grateful), and students roll up their sleeves in the kitchen next to pro chefs to make recipes with produce from local farms. .  Sterling\u2019s Rian Fried Center for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems houses more than 130 acres of farm and gardens, an edible forest garden, the Alfond Draft Horse Barn, hoop houses, and a sugarhouse and sugarbush for  maple syrup production   (it is, after all, Vermont). The college grows 35 percent of its own food using no pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Even cooler? Sterling sources 53% of their grub locally, either from large farms within a 150-mile radius or from small farms within 250 miles. Non-profit  The Real Food Challenge,   a nationwide initiative to make campus food more local, healthful, and sustainable has rated Sterling as #1 in America three years in a row. Those hungry for more can enroll in the  School of the New American Farmstead  , Sterling\u2019s continuing education program, and take classes like Fundamentals of Artisan Cheese, Wildcrafting: Food & Beverages from the Natural World, Artisan Breadmaking & Heritage Grains, and the Art of Fermentation. .

VSan Francisco, Oct 23 (IANS) Refuting media reports of sharing revenue with news publishers, Google has said there is no deal lined up with them and that its subscriptions project is in its early stages. \u201cWe have not reached any conclusion on the revenue side,\u201d Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels was quoted as saying by CNET late on Sunday. . \u201cWe haven\u2019t reached any conclusion [regarding] subscriptions and need to speak to publishers.\u201d. The tech giant has called the report of sharing revenue with news publishers \u201ctotally wrong\u201d and said it is yet to reach any conclusion on the revenue side. Earlier in the day, reports said that Google will give news publishers revenue-sharing deals similar to what it grants YouTube personalities and third-party ad hosts \u2014 helping them connect with a subscriber base. \u201cGoogle would likely take a cut of less than 30 per cent of subscription revenues,\u201d Richard Gingras, Head, Google News, was quoted as saying by Financial Times. The revenue-share agreements with the publishers could be similar to the company\u2019s AdSense business that allows the web publishers to place ads on their site. \u2013IANS. ksc/amit/vm.

V Mumbai, Oct 23 - Designer Neeta Lulla, who earlier designed for Grammy winning record producers The Chainsmokers, is now on board to design for Indo-American DJ and record producer KSHMR. .  DJ KSHMR, whose real name is Niles Hollowell-Dhar, started his tour across India starting from October 20. .  I have always been quite fascinated by Indian sensibilities when it comes to fashion and style and I'm excited to see what Neeta has in store for me, KSHMR said in a statement.  Promoted by Percept Live, after performing in New Delhi, KSHMR will be performing in Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai. .  KSHMR is known to love his kurtas so we have tried to experiment with the style, fabric and design and make a Diwali friendly kurta. The exotic vibe of Kashmir and the aesthetic history of paisley is all the inspiration we needed to design for the very talented Indo American DJ KSHMR, Lulla said.  The National Award winning designer says the design on the kurta will be rather subtle with an Indian touch with astute details in the embroidery.  Given the history of KSHMR and his love for Kashmir, the versatile paisleys seemed very apt to reflect our Indian heritage and the intricacy of our craftsmanship. KSHMR has been very experimental with his music and we thought of doing the same with his outfit.  We have also curated one more kurta where we have embroidered the KSHMR logo in ruby red jewels which he can wear when he performs on stage. The materials used are silk and cotton blend giving it a rich feel, Lulla added.  Lulla has also designed for international celebrities like Steven Seagal and Tyra Banks apart from designing for Bollywood stalwarts like Kangana Ranaut, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Rajnikanth, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan among others.  --IANS.  ks/sug .

VFeel bad leaving Fido at home while you visit the Happiest Place on Earth? Now you don\u2019t have to!.  For many families, this is a day they\u2019ve been waiting for since Lady and the Tramp came out. Okay, maybe not quite that long. But, finally, it has been announced that dogs are allowed at four Disney World resorts. Break out the food and water bowls!. Starting this past weekend, man\u2019s best friend can accompany you on your next magical vacation. As long as you book your stay at the Yacht Club Resort, Port Orleans Riverside Resort, the Art of Animation Resort, or the cabins at Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. Until now, the closest thing to having your pet on vacation with you was boarding him at the on-property kennel. Now, the furriest Disney fan in the family will be welcome to wag his way into a themed-out room right alongside you. And, there\u2019s more. . According to Oh My Disney, the participating resorts are now equipped with pet exercise and relief areas. Your canine will also get his own welcome kit from Pluto, which includes all the things he\u2019ll need to relax and enjoy his vacation, from a special ID tag to a mat with bowls and puppy pick-up bags, as well as a privacy door tag. . Of course, additional fees will apply if you want your pup to accompany you on your trip. Depending on where you stay, the pet and clean-up fees per night will run you between $50 - $75. Have more than one furry BFF? According to the Disney Parks Blog, each room will allow two dogs. Oh, and if you are not a dog lover, or suffer from allergies, don\u2019t worry. You can still stay at one of the pet-friendly resorts, as only certain floors have gone to the dogs. . Finally, wondering what you\u2019ll do with your puppy pal when you head out to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Disney Springs or one of the water parks? Pet-sitting services are available, for an extra cost, of course. To make your little buddy feel better about being separated from you for the day, just pick up a special gift for him in a souvenir shop (coming soon)!.

VAmit Khajuria . Tribune News Service . Unhygienic conditions and lack of infrastructure in the health centres across the region has forced the dengue patients to visit other states for better treatment. . The mosquito-borne disease, which has gripped eight districts of Jammu province, has affected more than 350 patients in the region. . Due to the unhygienic conditions and huge rush of patients in the hospitals, panic-stricken residents of Jammu are preferring to shift patients to the other states as they find local hospitals \u2018unreliable\u2019 for treatment. . The seriousness of the situation can be gauged at the SMGS Hospital, Jammu, where two patients can be seen sharing a single bed while some of the parents are made to hold their children in arms and wait for a bed to get vacant. . \u201cA day after I admitted my son in the hospital, he tested positive for dengue. We got a bed only after one of my relatives approached the superintendent and, that too, on a sharing basis. They are treating the patients in the most unhygienic conditions at the SMGS Hospital,\u201d said Praveen Kumar, father of an 11-year-old dengue patient. . \u201cI have no other option but to take my son to Punjab for better and reliable treatment. Here they might have qualified doctors, but I cannot take any chance with the life of my son,\u201d he added. . Similarly, most of the patients who can afford to move outside the state do not prefer treatment in Jammu hospitals. Sources informed that even doctors and paramedical staff of the Jammu hospitals suggest people to go outside the state for better treatment. . In the last one month, of the 2,100 samples tested by the Health Department, 350 cases were positive. However, according to sources, the figure is much higher as influential people usually prefer private diagnostic centres and straightway go outside the state. . Dr Gurjeet Singh, Health Director, Jammu, said, \u201cThere are no complications in all 350 cases of dengue. It is due to panic created by private laboratories that people are moving outside the state. We cannot stop anyone, but we are doing our best to treat all patients efficiently.\u201d .

VOne of India's biggest counterfeiters Abdul Karim Telgi who was sentenced for allegedly running a fake stamp paper racket died at Bengaluru's Victoria hospital at around 8: 30 pm on October October 23.   Stamp paper scam kingpin Telgi was suffering from meningitis and was on ventilator, his lawyer had said earlier. (Image: IE) . One of India\u2019s biggest counterfeiters Abdul Karim Telgi who was sentenced for allegedly running a fake stamp paper racket died at Bengaluru\u2019s Victoria hospital at around 8: 30 pm on October October 23. Stamp paper scam kingpin Telgi was suffering from meningitis and was on ventilator, his lawyer had said earlier. Reportedly, he died of multiple organ failure. In 2002-03, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) busted his racket after tapping a number of phones. Telgi was sentenced to a 30-year jail term for printing counterfeit stamp papers in India and selling them on to various institutions. The amount involved was then estimated to be worth billions of rupees. After SIT probe, the court slammed Telgi with a 30-year jail term for selling fake stamp paper to banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms and others. A fine of Rs 202 cr was imposed on Telgi. Telgi started off by selling stamps at his vending stall and later he started fulfilling large statutory and legal requirements demand for stamp papers which government was not providing in enough numbers to meet the huge demand in the country. Pune police had finally registered a case against Telgi in 2003 for allegedly heading the stamp paper scam. The size of the scam was reportedly said to be somewhere between Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 crore. All of this was happening right from the early 1990s. He had appointed as many as 350 people as agents who sold the fakes to bulk purchasers. In June 2007, Telgi was once again sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years for another case in the scandal. The Income Tax Department had requested that Telgi\u2019s properties should be confiscated to pay the fine.

VThe International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)-Hyderabad on 24 October announced the launch of a programme in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for technology professionals. Representational Image. IIIT-Hyderabad's Machine Learning Laboratory in partnership with TalentSprint will offer the four-month programme on foundations of AI and ML from January 2018 to address rising demand. The programme fee will be between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. The institute expects 1,000 students for the specialised course in the first year. P.J. Narayanan, Director of IIIT-Hyderabad, told reporters that the first batch will have 300 students. The number will be scaled up to 500. As one of the largest AI research clusters in the country, the institute is seeing a rising demand from the industry for AI and ML advisory services, technology prototypes and capacity building, he said. American research and advisory firm Gartner Inc has forecast the creation of 2.3 million jobs in AI, ML, and Deep Learning (DL) within three years. The hands-on teaching approach will enable engineers in industry to build deep ML programming capabilities in their companies, according to Narayana.

VThis satisfying vegetarian main is a great way to reset after a few weeks of meat-centered holiday eating. Make sure to cool the soup base completely before adding the tortellini; otherwise the pasta will absorb too much liquid and become gummy. Cook the remaining half package of tortellini and top salads for lunch during the week, or seal in a ziplock freezer bag, and freeze until you\u2019re ready to use them. Vegetable stocks can differ in concentration\u2014you may want to start with less and make up the difference with a bit more water depending on the brand you choose. Ingredients. 2 tablespoons olive oil. 2 cups chopped yellow onion (about 1 large). 2 cups chopped fennel bulb (about 1 large). 1/4 cup minced fresh garlic. 2 (8-oz.) pkg. sliced cremini mushrooms. 2 tablespoons unsalted tomato paste. 8 cups unsalted vegetable stock. 4 cups water. 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. 2 (15-oz.) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained. 2 (15-oz.) cans unsalted chickpeas, rinsed and drained. 6 cups stemmed, chopped curly kale. 1 1/2 (9-oz.) pkg. whole-wheat 3-cheese tortellini. 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar. 1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley.

VHighlights. Essential Products has slashed the price of Essential Phone . It's a limited time offer, the company says . The move comes as Google and Apple launch their respective phones. As Google begins shipping the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL smartphones, Andy Rubin's Essential Products has slashed the price of the company's first smartphone - the Essential Phone - from $699 (roughly Rs. 45,460) to $499 (roughly Rs. 32,457) as the newly founded startup attempts to better compete with the big guns. Niccolo de Masi, President and Chief Operating Officer of Essential, made the announcement over the weekend, noting that the move comes as the startup attempts to "make it even easier for you to experience our products and our band." Users can purchase the handset at the revised price from Essential.com, he said. The price revision may help the Essential Phone lure some customers who might have been eyeing Apple's iPhone X, which goes on sale on November 3, and Google's Pixel 2 XL, which went on sale this month. Compared to Essential Phone's $499 price sticker, the Google Pixel 2 XL starts at $849, whereas the base variant iPhone X is priced at $999. Or so will be the hope of the company. According to some figures from marketing research firms, the Essential Phone isn't exactly a hot seller. Baystreet Research, which tracks shipments of phones and other devices across the US, estimated last month that Essential Products has sold just 5,000 units on Sprint carrier in the US. Even as the data didn't reveal exactly how many phones Essential Products has shipped from various channels, it gives us a glimpse at what to expect. Essential says the price drop is part of a "limited time offer," so you might want to rush if you want the handset. The offer will end on November 15th, according to the description in the footprint. Interested customers can avail the discount from this page. "At Essential, one of our driving principles is that premium craftsmanship and the latest technologies shouldn't be for the few. We could have created a massive TV campaign to capture your attention, but we think making it easier for people to get their hands on our first products is a better way to get to know us," Essential's Masi wrote.

VChildren wearing rain suits walk in a heavy rain as Typhoon Lan approaches Japan\u2019s mainland, in Tokyo, Japan, October 22, 2017. Credit: Reuters. Tokyo: A rapidly weakening typhoon Lan made landfall in Japan on Monday, setting off landslides and flooding that prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, but then headed out to sea after largely sparing the capital, Tokyo. Three people were reported killed, hundreds of plane flights cancelled, and train services disrupted in the wake of Lan, which had maintained intense strength until virtually the time it made landfall west of Tokyo in the early hours of Monday. At least three people were killed, one a man in his 60s who was passing a building site when scaffolding collapsed on top of him and another a fisherman tending to his boat. The third was killed when a landslide engulfed his home, media said. Two others were left comatose by injuries and one man was missing, NHK public television said. Nearly 90 others suffered minor injuries. Rivers burst their banks in several parts of Japan and fishing boats were tossed up on land. A container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbour wall but all 19 crew members escaped injury. High waves caused by Typhoon Lan break on the shores of Senjojiki, Shirahama town, Wakayama prefecture, Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo October 22, 2017. Credit: Reuters. Some 80,000 people in Koriyama, a city 200 km (124 miles) north of Tokyo, were ordered to evacuate as a river neared the top of its banks, NHK said, and several hundred houses in western Japan were flooded. \u201cMy grandchild lives over there. The house is fine, but the area is flooded, and they can\u2019t get out,\u201d one man told NHK. Lan had weakened to a category 2 storm when it made landfall early on Monday, sideswiping Tokyo, after powering north for days as an intense category 4 storm, according to the Tropical Storm Risk monitoring site. Lan is the Marshall islands word for \u201cstorm\u201d. The centre of the storm was out in the Pacific northeast of Tokyo on Monday afternoon and it was moving northeast at 75 kmh (47 mph), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It was expected to become a tropical depression on Tuesday. Around 350 flights were cancelled and train services disrupted over a wide area of Japan, although most commuter trains were running smoothly in Tokyo. Toyota Motor Corp cancelled the first shift at all of its assembly plants but said it would operate the second shift as normal.

V For the devout, Nagula Chavithi is a festival dedicated to worshipping snakes, but animal rights activists cry foul that festival is actually a death trap for the snakes. Celebrated on the fourth day after Diwali every year, devotees carry milk and other puja items to worship serpents for prosperity and well-being on this day. But many are unaware of the toll the rituals take on the snakes, many of which end up dead. "What many don't realise is that snakes don't even drink milk. Pouring large quantities of milk into the pits only manages to suffocate the snake," says Pradeep Kumar Nath, founder of VSPCA (Visakha Society for Protection and Care of Animals). .  Poojitha, an animal lover, believes it is misconception and ignorance that drives people to inflict harm on the reptiles. "What the ritual is actually about and what people practice today, are two separate things. The concept of pouring in milk signifies abhishekam. It was not done to feed the snake. But now, people take sachets of milk to 'feed' the snakes instead of small. The milk poured in the pits saturates the soil and destroys both the eco system and a snake's digestive system. As if that isn't enough, we burst firecrackers near these pits. Though burning firecrackers is the ritual, bursting noisy ones and scaring the .  snake isn't." .  Pradeep Kumar Nath, points out that the festival also encourages cruelty on the reptile. "Every year, the tribal people known as 'snake people' supply these cobras after yanking out their fangs and sewing their mouths shut before bringing them to the devotees. These cobras are caught ten days before the festival and are held captive in suffocating baskets devoid of food and water. By the time Nagula Chavithi is observed, the cobra is already half dead," he explains. .  Activists, however state that the scenario, over the last few years, has seen some signs of improvement in Hyderabad. "Thanks to awareness campaigns by NGOs and snake rescue operations, the scenario has improved in the last few years. It's heartening to see that lot of devotees have completely stopped the practice of offering milk to snakes during the festival due to our campaigns. Also, people think twice before killing a snake now. They first call snake rescue centres or handover snakes to NGO's and the forest department. The number of anti-venom centres in city that offer treatment for snake bites to have doubled," says Hyderabad-based eco-activist Ravi Jillapalli, eco activist. .

V         Stories had been integral to human culture and will continue to be so. The style of storytelling keeps on changing. For example, earlier, the storytelling followed the oral tradition, then it followed the expressive arts formats and currently it is the multi-media format that is dominant.   .  If you have a camera, you can create 'photo stories' with little education, effort, planning and practice. If you are not a good orator, you can narrate a story with a series of photographs by honing a few skills.  Producing photo-stories and photo- essays will take your photography to a new creative level of visual storytelling through photography. In visual storytelling, images are ordered in a specific way, either chronologically or as a series or sequence of happening. Writing captions as narratives are also an integral part of a photo story that should help the viewer understand each shot of the series. Captions expand the photographer's as well as viewer's understanding of a snap shot. Planning is an essential part of the process for visual storytelling ahead of photography. Create a tentative structure in mind and write your plan. This will help you to think and create a narrative around the photographs. Your photography plan should include the following steps: selecting the topic, theme or message; research on the topic; clarifying your topic though probable images; and finally planning your shots. Just like a film, your visual narrative should have a lead or opening shot; two-three establishing long and mid shots, 5-10 interactive and sequential shots to build the story, and a conclusion or closing shot to end the story. Creating good photo stories is more a matter of learning by doing and taking a challenge. After some basics and practice, switch over to trusting your instincts and sharpening of your common sense to make stories unfold. This will help you not be afraid of failures or criticism to make you spontaneously creative in photo-storytelling.

V  Amazon  on Tuesday launched a new shipping program designed to make  business  purchasing even easier. Dubbed Business Prime Shipping , the paid annual membership program offers free two-day shipping to all users on an Amazon Business account. . Amazon is hoping the speed and convenience that have made it a household name among ordinary consumers can carry over to the business space.  Pricing is based on the number of users attached to a business account. Small businesses with up to 10 users will pay $499 annually, those with up to 100 users can expect to shell out $1,299 and large companies with over 100 registered users will pay $10,999 per year. . As the name suggests, Amazon Business is specifically tailored to meet the needs of businesses. It offers access to hundreds of millions of products with perks such as business-only pricing and selection, a multi-seller marketplace, tax exemptions, dedicated customer support and more.  Investors are concerned and rightfully so. Amazon could utilize low prices and expedited shipping to wipe smaller suppliers out entirely and capture significant market share from larger players, just as it has done in other industries. . Indeed, Amazon\u2019s announcement is already having an impact. Industrial supply companies W.W. Grainger Inc. and Fastenal Co. saw their respective stock values take a hit on Tuesday. As of writing, Grainger is down more than five percent and Fastenal isn\u2019t far behind with a loss of 3.85 percent. Interested companies can sign up for a 30-day free trial.

VPorsche has kept the promise of introducing purists' 911 with the reveal of the 911 T. The T in the name stands for Touring and is the third introduction in the same vein of the \u2018pure\u2019 911 after the 911 R and the 911 GT3 Touring. It also pays homage to the original 911 T of 1968 that introduced the back-to-basics approach. . The 911 T is the lightest car in the current 911 range thanks to the stripped interior. It tips the scale at a mere 1425kilograms. There are only two seats in the Carrera T, but you get rear-wheel steering as optional which is not available for the standard 911 Carrera. Transmission is a manual with a shorter constant transaxle ratio and there is a standard mechanical rear differential lock as well. The 911 Carrera T is also equipped with several performance-enhancing features that are not available on the standard 911 Carrera. This includes the PASM Sport Suspension with a 10 mm lower ride height, a shortened gear lever with an embossed shift pattern, and Sport-Tex material seat. The rear windshield and rear side windows are made of lightweight glass, and there are door opener loops instead of conventional door openers. Similar to the 911 GTS models, the sound insulation has also been reduced. Porsche has fitted the 911 T with a front spoiler lip that comes with the PASM Sport Suspension. The car rides on a set of 20-inch wheels from Carrera S. The car can be had in five standard and three metallic paint finish. On the inside, you get four-way electric seats but there is an option of full bucket seats as well (first time on a 911 Carrera model). . Powering the 911 T is the same twin-turbo 3.0 flat-six engine which produces 370bhp. The torque is rated at 450Nm from as low as 1,750rpm to 5,000rpm. The lightest 911 can accelerate from 0-100kmph in 4.3seconds, which is 0.1seconds quicker than the standard 911 Carrera. Top speed is 292.13kmph. With the PDK automatic transmission, the T is even quicker taking just four seconds to hit the ton but is a tad slower in the top speed. . The 2018 911 Carrera T is now available to order and is expected to hit the roads by March 2018. The prices for the T starts at $102,100 (Rs 66.8 lakhs).

VDoha [Qatar], Oct 23 (ANI): United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held talks with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in a bid to resolve the Gulf diplomatic crisis. During the talks, Al-Thani affirmed Qatar's continued commitment to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve the Gulf crisis. He also briefed his US counterpart on the latest developments of the Gulf crisis and the Kuwaiti mediation efforts to resolve the issue. The two leaders also discussed the strategic relations between the two countries and ways of boosting and developing them in various fields, as well as the international efforts to fight against the ISIS terror group, besides the latest developments in the region, especially in Syria, Iraq and Palestine. Stressing on Qatar's commitment to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) system, Al-Thani affirmed that the convening of any summit of the GCC will be a good opportunity for a civilized and diplomatic dialogue between the GCC countries. In a joint news conference with his Qatari counterpart, Tillerson said he is not hopeful about Saudi Arabia willingness to begin direct talks to resolve a months-long diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. "In my meetings with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, I asked him to engage in dialogue, but there is not a strong indication that parties are ready to talk yet. We cannot force talks upon people who are not ready to talk," The Peninsula quoted Tillerson, as saying while referring to his earlier discussions in Riyadh. "It's very important for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to continue to pursue unity," he added. Tillerson visited Qatar after his visit to Saudi Arabia as part of a new push to end the current Gulf crisis. Earlier in June this year, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt had snapped its diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of financing extremist groups and imposed a land, air and sea blockade on their Gulf neighbour. However, Qatar rejected these allegations and termed the actions by Gulf member countries of isolating it diplomatically as "unjustified". (ANI).

VFounded by Liz Watt, a trained beauty professional, and business partner and friend Melanie Ess, Boo-ti Parlour stands out because:. 1. It spoils customers rotten \u2013 you get an iPad to plug into Netflix while you stretch out in an Osim massage chair behind drawn curtains for complete privacy. . 2. Facials are carried out in a cosy, partitioned room at the back to minimise noise from the main area where nails are done. When Boo-ti has an event at its second storey space, facials won't be available due to the noise. But it's business as usual downstairs for manis/pedis as customers will be plugged into Netflix. 3. According to Watt, Boo-ti Parlour is the first spa in Singapore to offer Sothy's Homme Facial, "because we want our male customers \u2013 we see one for every four women \u2013 to experience a facial with products made for their skin". . 4. Boo-ti's second storey is for skincare, makeup and grooming workshops, and even yoga classes. . Verdict. Posted by Boo-Ti Parlour on Tuesday, 20 June 2017. "I love how I get a personal iPad to watch Netflix shows so I don't have to tune in to a communal TV screening a show that I'm not interested in. The Osim massage chairs are super comfy and the best part about the privacy curtain is that I can draw it to avoid awkward conversations with fellow customers. Hygiene is also top-notch as all the tools \u2013 including the basins where you soak your feet during a pedicure (here's a pedicure expose you must read) \u2013 are sanitised and sterilized between customers." - Dione, beauty writer. Posted by Boo-Ti Parlour on Monday, 10 October 2016. "The Sothy's facial is super gentle and hydrating, and I could barely hear any noise drifting in from the main area where the customers do their nails during my session. Watt is a one-woman show as she handles all the facials, so you can be guaranteed personable and friendly service every time." - Kayce, beauty writer. Opening hours: 10am to 8pm daily. www.boo-tiparlour.com; tel: 6344-4048. A version of this story was originally published in the October 2017 issue of Her World magazine. .

VThe flood situation worsened in some parts of Manipur with torrential rain flooding more villages and paddy fields and the Iril river flowing above the danger mark on Monday. Villagers said that though the rain had stopped in the valley districts there is still heavy downpour in the hill areas from where all the rivers originate. Some villages at Naharup in Imphal east district and Urup and Arabati in Thoubal district were inundated along with some paddy fields. Angry villagers said that no official and local legislators visited them. They elevated and strengthened the river banks using their own resources to check overflowing.The main streets in the city areas at Sagolband and Uripok in Imphal west district are also flooded. Farmers said they were hoping that after the floods there would be a bountful harvest. But they are now afraid that the verdant paddy fields will be destroyed by the current spell of rain. They also said that they have not received any assistance from the government although the Central government had sanctioned money for flood victims in the northeast. Chief Minister N. Biren Singh had announced soon after the July floods that the government will distribute quick yielding paddy plants. The farmers said that they are yet to get the plants. The torrential rain started in the valley areas on Saturday morning. -IANS.

VIANS. Tokyo, Oct 23 (IANS) At least five people were killed with transportation systems and businesses severely disrupted as typhoon Lan lashed Japan's Pacific coast after making landfall on Monday. The typhoon, with an atmospheric pressure of 950 hectopascals at its centre and packing powerful winds of up to 198 kph, hit the Shizuoka prefecture on Honshu island at around 3 a.m., reports Xinhua news agency. According to local media reports, the 21st typhoon of the season left a trail of destruction, with rivers bursting their banks and landslides engulfing homes, with the western region of Wakayama prefecture seeing as much as 800 mm of rain through a 48-hour period to Sunday. According to the weather agency, Mie prefecture was also hard hit, with the powerful storm dumping 700 mm of rain through the same period, which also caused extensive flooding in parts of Nara prefecture. The victims were reported from Fukuoka, Yamaguchi, Osaka, Wakayama and Mie prefectures. Operations will be halted until Monday evening at Toyota Motor Corp.'s factories in multiple prefectures, including Iwate, Miyagi and Gifu. Japan's two major airline carriers, Japan Airlines Co. and All Nippon Airways Co., cancelled more than 100 flights, with 25,000 passengers affected. Shinkansen bullet train services were suspended along parts of the Tokaido line, and local services in Tokyo and Osaka were disrupted during rush hour. Evacuation orders were issued in some cities and towns, and vote counting following Sunday's lower house election suspended until Monday in areas where access to polling stations was affected by the typhoon. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, typhoon Lan will be downgraded to an extra tropical cyclone on Monday night when it reaches east of Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.

VKolkata, Oct 23 : Demands for tickets for the shifted Brazil-England U-17 World Cup semifinal here skyrocketed with an online queue of more than a lakh registered within an hour after it was thrown open at the official FIFA site. \u201cYou are in an online queue for the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017 tickets. Once it is your turn, you will have 10 minutes to enter the website,\u201d the message on the website read quoting a serial number 121911 with 84735 users still ahead within an hour after it went live. It was a win-win situation for football loving Kolkata fans as FIFA announced the shift in venue from Guwahati with less than 48 hours before the match in an unprecedented development. A known Brazil bastion, Kolkata turned up in record numbers to swell the Saltlake Stadium to support the yellow brigade in their 2-1 quarterfinal win yesterday. With Kolkata set to host the summit clash on October 28, the crowd now have a chance to witness the Samba magic gain as the response is evident from the huge ticket craze. \u201cThe sort of craze we are seeing, it seems selling the tickets would not pose any problem. We are more concerned with giving a large number of options to the fans to redeem the tickets,\u201d FIFA Local Organising Committee project director Joy Bhattacharjya said. The FIFA has put a flat rate of tickets at Rs 100 giving fans in Guwahati the priority as about 18,000 were sold there. Nagpur-based ardent sports fan Om Mundhra, who was to reach Guwahati tomorrow, now has to cancel his flight tickets and alter his travel plans. \u201cCancelling the flight tickets is not priority but I must get the Kolkata tickets now. I\u2019ve booked the tickets months in advance. Till now I\u2019m in queue. But I\u2019m looking forward to watch both the semifinals and final in Kolkata now,\u201d he said.

He'd been driving around all night, and was in the nearby town of Schellville, when he saw something that stopped him in his tracks -- a tree full of fire. Bright orange and red flames flickered and flared through several gaps in the large tree's trunk. Smoke poured out near the tree's top, like a chimney. McDermott said it was an unbelievable sight on what was an unbelievable day, as he crisscrossed the roads trying to find the best way out of the fiery madness. "I've definitely not seen anything like this before," McDermott, who's lived in Sonoma for 10 years, told CNN. "We wanted to know the escape routes in case we needed them. The route to Poloma was open. I just stopped on the side of the road and the whole ridge is on fire.". McDermott said while he was out checking the roads he bought masks -- all the smoke from the fires has turned the air toxic in the Bay Area -- and passed them out to whomever needed it. He also said his parents and other relatives who live in the area are safe. CNN's Doug Criss contributed to this report.

VArchit Watts. Tribune News Service. With the number of patients suffering from dengue on the rise, goat milk is selling in between Rs 250 and 300 per litre here in the district. The daily report of the Health Department shows that as many as 57 dengue patients have been detected in the district so far. The report was, however, nil at the end of August. Health Department officials said there was no loss of life due to dengue till date, but some medical practitioners claimed otherwise. A dengue patient said goat owners were charging six times the cost of milk, which was earlier easily available at Rs 40-60 per litre. It is a common belief that goat milk helps in increasing the blood platelet count. He further demanded that the administration should keep a check on the price of goat milk. The doctors, however, rarely prescribe it to the patients. \u201cNo scientific study has proved the efficacy of goat milk for dengue, but it is not even harmful thus the demand has risen,\u201d said a doctor. The goat milk is easily digestible and recommended for infants. Sources in the Health Department said as many as 34 dengue patients were identified in the Muktsar block, 10 in the Chak Sherewala block, five in the Doda block, three each in Malout and Alamwala blocks and two in the Gidderbaha block. Dr Vikram Asija, district epidemiologist, Muktsar, said, \u201cThough there is a rise in the number of dengue patients, the situation is much better than other districts. Our anti-larvae teams are visiting across the district to take measures in this regard. Besides, we are regularly appealing to people to get the tests done free from any civil hospital in the district.\u201d. He added, \u201cThe dengue cases have risen to 57 this year in just last about one-and-a-half month.\u201d. In demand . The daily report of the Health Department shows that as many as 57 dengue patients have been detected in the district so far. The report was, however, nil at the end of August. Goat milk is selling in between Rs 250 and Rs 300 per litre in Muktsar.

VBy Jim Finkle. Oct 23 (Reuters) - Kaspersky Lab will ask independent parties to conduct security reviews of its widely used anti-virus software to help dispel allegations that the Russian government uses the products to conduct espionage, the Moscow-based company said on Monday. Kaspersky said in a statement that it would submit the source code of its software and future product updates for review by "the broader information-security community and other stakeholders." It also vowed to have outside parties review other aspects of its business, including software development. Reviews of the software, which is used on some 400 million computers worldwide, will begin by the first quarter of next year, the company said. The company did not name the outside reviewers, but said in a statement that it would soon announce parties with "strong credentials in software security and assurance testing for cyber-security products.". U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last month barred government agencies from using Kaspersky Lab anti-virus products, citing concerns that the company was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that use of its software could jeopardize national security. Kaspersky has repeatedly denied those accusations, saying it has not helped Russia or other governments engage in espionage. The Trump administration decision represented a sharp response to what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a national security threat posed by Russia in cyberspace, following a U.S. election year marred by allegations that Moscow weaponized the internet in an attempt to influence its outcome. Chief Executive Officer Eugene Kaspersky said in a statement that he believed the steps announced on Monday would help restore trust in his company. "We want to show how we're completely open and transparent," he said. "We've nothing to hide.". The company said it would open "transparency centers" in Asia, Europe and the United States where customers, governments and others can access results of the outside reviews and discuss any concerns about the security of Kaspersky products. It also said it would expand a program where it pays independent security researchers to find security vulnerabilities in its products, boosting the maximum award size to $100,000 from $5,000.

VImphal: The flood situation worsened in some parts of Manipur with torrential rain flooding more villages and paddy fields and the Iril river flowing above the danger mark on Monday. Representational Image. Villagers said that though the rain had stopped in the valley districts there is still heavy downpour in the hill areas from where all the rivers originate. Some villages at Naharup in Imphal east district and Urup and Arabati in Thoubal district were inundated along with some paddy fields.  Angry villagers said that no official and local legislators visited them. They elevated and strengthened the river banks using their own resources to check overflowing. The main streets in the city areas at Sagolband and Uripok in Imphal west district are also flooded.  Farmers said they were hoping that after the floods there would be a bountful harvest. But they are now afraid that the verdant paddy fields will be destroyed by the current spell of rain.  They also said that they have not received any assistance from the government although the Central government had sanctioned money for flood victims in the northeast.  Chief Minister N. Biren Singh had announced soon after the July floods that the government will distribute quick yielding paddy plants. The farmers said that they are yet to get the plants.  The torrential rain started in the valley areas on Saturday morning. .

VWelp. The Phoenix Suns had a brutal Sunday afternoon that included the firing of their head coach, Earl Watson, and a subtweet from their veteran Eric Bledsoe about wanting to get the heck out of there. Then Bledsoe was openly recruited by conference rival DeAndre Jordan on Twitter. It was all somehow uglier than the two 40-plus-point losses the team suffered in its opening week. Now-former assistant coach Mehmut Okur added onto the pile. Okur was fired along with two other assistant coaches on Sunday, and he took to Instagram in a not-so-thankful way.

VDisappointed with continuous harassment by money lender, Isakimuthu took wife and daughters to Tirunelveli on the pretext of meeting the Collector and set them ablaze. Onlookers came to the rescue of the children after their father set them ablaze outside the Collector's office in Tirunelveli. A daily wage labourer today set his wife and two daughters on fire outside the Collector's office in Tirunelveli. . Isakimuthu and his wife Subbulakshmi were allegedly being harassed by a money lender but they failed to pay the amount. Subbulakshmi had borrowed Rs 1.45 lakh from Muthulakshmi eight months ago, which she claims to have repaid. Though Subbulakshmi had paid around Rs 2.35 lakh including the interest, however, the money lender was demanding more money in the form of interest. According to Isakimuthu's brother, they filed a complaint with the police but no action was taken. . Disappointed with the continuous harassment and inaction by the police, Isakimuthu (28) took wife (25) and daughters, aged 5 and 2, to Tirunelveli on the pretext of meeting the Collector over a solution on the issue. He then poured petrol on them and set them ablaze before attempting self immolation. Onlookers immediately came to the rescue of the family and poured water on them. Police officials then rushed the four to a hospital. . "It took me almost 20 minutes to realise what I was witnessing. I don't think the children will survive," stated a shocked onlooker. "The problem was with loan sharks. The cops were taking the money lender's side. Isakimuthu couldn't do anything. When he tried seeking help from the Collector, he was directed to the SP's office and then back to the police station, which hand in gloves with the loan sharks. There was no other way out, which is why Isakimuthu must have done this", said his brother.

Kher says though it is too early for him to list his \u201cto do things\u201d, he hopes to inspire the students by sharing his experience as an actor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry the burden of being Anupam Kher. I will ask the students and work with them and may be come up with something,\u201d Kher told PTI. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to give them a vast knowledge of world cinema and inspire them. Sometimes you can inspire them by telling your own stories.\u201d. The actor says his stories are not just about his triumphs but also about his defeats and failures. \u201cI am the sum total of my successes and failures. All those years of my days spent on streets of Mumbai are also a part of my knowledge sharing with students.\u201d. Kher is all set to visit Australia in December this year to attend an \u2018In conversation\u2019 event series and award night launched by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA). Kher says while Indian cinema and talent are being recognised globally, Indian audience is also becoming more knowledgeable. \u201cBecause of satellite channels, multiplexes, Indian audience has become more educated and just won\u2019t accept anything that is shown to them. \u201cSo many actors, technicians and camera men are emerging and if you are hardworking and an optimist in today\u2019s time you will find work.\u201d. Kher is currently working on his new book \u201cLessons Life Taught Me Unknowingly\u201d, to be released next April. He will next star in \u201cHotel Mumbai\u201d, an American Australian film directed by Anthony Maras. The movie is based on the 2009 documentary \u201cSurviving Mumbai\u201d, about the Mumbai attacks in 2008 at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.

VCorker: Leaders know what Trump says is untrue. Washington (CNN)Sen. Thom Tillis went to a lunch with Republican lawmakers carrying a bag of popcorn, ready for President Donald Trump's visit to Capitol Hill after he feuded with Sen. Bob Corker Tuesday morning. . A reporter asked the North Carolina Republican if the popcorn was for the fight between the two, which escalated after Trump accused Corker on Twitter of fighting his plans for tax reform. The Tennessee Republican later took to Twitter to call Trump an "utterly untruthful president" and slammed him in an explosive interview with CNN's Manu Raju. Tillis affirmed that the popcorn was in preparation for the lunch that will include both Trump and Corker, and tweeted a picture of himself at a popcorn machine with the caption, "Ready for lunch with POTUS and @SenateGOP." .

VThe answer lies in some of these sizzling snaps. The former Miss Portugal ditched her tiara and sash for some seriously sexy black satin. And when GQ caught up with Iva Lamaro in 2011, there was a camera, some lingerie, stockings and high heels involved. The pageant winner has a Master\u2019s degree in biochemistry and has posed for some of the most prestigious fashion magazines in her home country. So if there was any doubt about Iva Lamaro\u2019s modelling chops, these photos should easily eliminate it:. 1 / 4. Bra, knickers; both by Triumph Elegant Essence. Jewellery by Accessorize.

Oil is holding above $50 a barrel on speculation the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will decide to extend supply curbs past the end of March when it meets in Vienna on Nov. 30. Geopolitical tensions in northern Iraq have also helped to support prices the past week, with Iraqi forces regaining control of Zummar town where Batma and Ain Zala fields are located. West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced as much as 40 cents to $52.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $52.10 at 8:01 a.m. in Hong Kong. Total volume traded was about 58 percent below the 100-day average. The November contract expired Friday after gaining 0.4 percent to $51.47.

VVijaya Narayanan with Luke after it was spotted.  Chennai: . After having offered to volunteer in the search for Luke two-and-a-half months ago, Vijaya Narayanan (53), an animal welfare activist in Besant Nagar, finally received a call on Saturday night. . The dog belonging to the German globetrotting couple Steffan Kaggrah and Janin had allegedly been stolen near the Marina Beach, during the couple\u2019s short stay in the city. They tried everything possible to search for the dog and even announced a handsome reward for those finding it, but later returned to Germany. As news spread, several other activists tried to trace the missing dog. They stuck posters across the city, distributed pamphlets and flooded social media with images of the missing dog. . Vijaya continued her search in a methodical manner. \u201cI had advertised in various newspapers and put up posters wherever I could, covering the entire city. We distributed flyers to everyone,\u201d she said. On Saturday, she got a call, which changed everything. \u201cThe man who called said he has a dog that resembled the picture on the posters that I had put up. When I saw the picture, I was sure it was Luke,\u201d Vijaya remarked. .

V HYDERABAD: Telangana has recorded the seventh highest number of swine flu cases this year so far and as per the latest data Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Delhi have recorded more number of cases. Last year, Telangana stood at fifth position. .  So far a total of 14,365 samples from across the state have been tested and 2,112 have been tested positive. Also, 43 swine flu deaths have been recorded in the state. Gujarat tops the list with 7,658 swine flu cases and 431deaths. .   The state had recorded an 'unusually high' number of cases during the summer (when cases are usually at a minimal) this year. A similar increase in cases was reported from other southern states that led to a suspicion of mutation of the virus. .  The mutation of the virus from the earlier California strain to the newer Michigan strain of swine flu was confirmed around April this year. "While the number of cases continue to come in, we are able to detect cases early due to the increased number of samples being tested. This has helped in decreasing the mortality rate," explained a senior official from the state health -department. .  However, experts say that the number of cases might rise during the winter. "Currently only 7-10 cases are being recorded each day, the numbers may increase during the winter. However, there is no outburst of the virus. It is under control," said Dr K Shankar, director Institute of Preventive Medicine and superintendent Fever Hospital. .
