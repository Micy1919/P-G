VJoey Logano won the drama-filled Can-Am 500 Chase elimination race at Phoenix International Raceway on Sunday, keeping his 2016 Sprint Cup title hopes alive.\u000aLogano held off a bevy of challengers on second green-white-checkered overtime finish to win the race at PIR. Kyle Busch finished second to secure the only other available berth in the Championship 4 group that will race for the championship next Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\u000aNone of it was accomplished easily.\u000aMatt Kenseth appeared on the verge of winning the race and advancing to the Championship 4 race at when he wrecked on the first green-white-checkered overtime finish. Kenseth appeared to come down in his No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota on the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet of Alex Bowman, the Dale Earnhardt Jr. substitute who was attempting to win his first NASCAR race.\u000aIn a flash, Kenseths 2016 championship hopes were gone C setting up a second OT restart.\u000aThis time, Logano led the field to green, starting on the outside of the front row alongside Kyle Busch on the inside. Both were fighting for their own championship lives, as was Phoenix track specialist Kevin Harvick C who started third and needed to win the race to advance to the Championship 4.\u000aLogano surged ahead and was not seriously threatened the rest of the way.\u000as on the verge of winning the race going away when Michael McDowell had a tire go down and hit the wall with just two laps remaining, bringing out the caution and setting up a green-white-checkered overtime finish.\u000aOn the OT restart, with Kenseth on the outside in the front row alongside of upstart non-Chase driver Alex Bowman. As they got into Turn 1, Bowman tried to block Kyle Busch and Kenseth pinched down on Bowman, who seemed to have nowhere to go.\u000aKenseth went spinning off, and so did his Chase chances, opening the Championship 4 door for not only Logano but Kyle Busch, the defending Sprint Cup champion.\u000aEarlier, Chaser Denny Hamlin and his crew chief, Mike Wheeler, attempted a Hail Mary-type strategy on a restart that ultimately backfired on the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing team. While the rest of the leaders and Chase contenders came to pit road when the caution flag came out with 57 laps to go, Wheeler instructed Hamlin to stay out and save fuel.\u000aBut Hamlin was on old tires, and he could not hold off Logano for even a full lap before Logano passed him to regain the lead.\u000aWhen another caution came out for debris with 47 to go, Hamlin was hanging onto second and had no choice but to continue to stay out on the track. This time, he lost one position after another following the ensuing restart C taking him from being in the Championship 4 to way out of it.\u000aWhile all the Chasers kept slicing and dicing their way, dancing in and out of the Championship 4 picture, Bowmans No. 88 Chevrolet continued to be the fastest car on the track.\u000aAs the laps wound down, Kenseth, Logano and Kyle Busch were running 1-2-3 C but with Bowman bearing down on them.\u000aBowman passed Busch for third with 17 to go, then went to work on trying to catch Logano. Two laps later, Bowman passed Logano for second.\u000aThen Busch passed Logano to move into third.\u000aThey remained that way until McDowells wreck brought out the caution that set up the chain of events that knocked Kenseth out of the championship hunt, and ushered Logano and Kyle Busch back in.

VDonald Trump finally crossed a line hes held short of until there was nobody left to offend. He went after Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics \u005cu0026 Religious Liberty Commission.\u000a.@drmoore Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!\u000a Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 9, 2016\u000aMoore has consistently written of Trumps moral failings, his lack of repentance, humility or Godly character as disqualifications for office. At least for Christians to support.\u000aBut now with the nomination all but in hand, Trump believes he doesnt need conservative Christians to take on Hillary. In fact, the general election will be decided by liberals, atheist libertarians and alt-right nativists. There will be no place at the table for many Christ followers.\u000aAs one pastor said last summer, if we elect this man to the White House, Christians will get everything that is coming to us.\u000aFor his part, Moore maintained his Biblical stance in his response.\u000a1 Kings 18:17-19 https://t.co/gpbDUbhIiB\u000a Russell Moore (@drmoore) May 9, 2016

VTouching more upon what Leah wrote about concerning corrupt bargains and the Clintons, the FBI released documents relating to a FOIA request on the controversial pardon of commodities trader Marc Rich yesterday, who faced multiple counts of tax evasion. He fled to Switzerland prior to being indicted on a whole host of charges, including not paying $48 million in income taxes, trading with Iran, wire fraud, and racketeering. Rich died in 2013, but his pardon remained a source of palace intrigue, especially since theres allegations that it could have been influenced by money. Richs wife was a heavyweight in the Democratic donor world, who gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to what would become the Clinton Foundation and Hillarys New York Senate campaign (via USA Today):\u000a"This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization," reads a statement on the FBI records vault website. "The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005. The material is heavily redacted due to personal privacy protections and grand jury secrecy rules." \u000aRich, who died in 2013, was a financier who fled to Switzerland after being indicted on multiple federal charges, including tax evasion, in 1983. Clinton's motive for pardoning Rich on his last day in office was questioned because Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a wealthy Democratic donor who made a $450,000 donation to Clinton's presidential library foundation and more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign.\u000aNow, the Clinton campaign has noted that the timing of this release is odd, though the FBI maintains that they followed protocol regarding the release of FOIA requested documents, according to Politico:\u000a"The FBI's Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. By law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBIs public reading room shortly after they are processed," an FBI spokesperson said. "Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBIs public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.\u000aThis is sort of a double-edged sword. On one hand, its another situation where a Clinton, a pile of cash, and a possible ethically challenged decisions was made; a decision that shines more light into the morally ambiguous (or depraved) ways this power couple operates and will continue to operate should they be let back into the White House. It would a gold rush for the wealthy and well connecteda new Gilded Age. Then again, the FBI is already accused of playing politics with their announcement of that they will be reviewing 650,000 Clinton-related emails found on Anthony Weiners laptop; Clintons top aide Huma Abedin shared the device. Weiner is under a separate investigation for online interactions with an underage girl, which led to the discovery of this trove of emails. FBI Director James Comey has been the Lefts punching bag, though he was their hero last summer, over the past few days for disclosing this update to the public. The original probe was all but closed in July, in which Comey held a press conference to announce that Clinton would not be charged, despite tearing into her and her staffs practices concerning handling classified material. Hes facing blowback, but probably deduced that the backlash would be greater for the bureau should they sit on telling Congress of the emails and risk being accused of being part of a cover-up. In the end, this is all the Clintons fault, though that point and the ethical issues surrounding the Rich pardon could be lost due to the hyper partisan lens the FBI is seen through as of late. \u000aBloomberg reported that Richs companies plead guilty to 35 counts of tax evasion and paid $90 million in fines.

VMark Zuckerberg on Saturday vigorously defended Facebook Inc. against criticism that fake news and misinformation on the social media site may have swayed the outcome of the presidential election, emphasizing his view that Facebooks role isnt to be arbiters of truth.\u000aMr. Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive and co-founder, said in a lengthy post that less than 1% of the sites world-wide content could be classified as fake.\u000aOverall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook page late Saturday. He said the fake news occurs across party lines.\u000aContent on Facebook includes personal updates, photos and other information that isnt considered news. Since not everyone sees the same content, some users feeds may feature significantly more fake news than others.\u000aMr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook is developing tools to reduce fake news on the site, but that its responsibility should be limited.\u000aDefining the truth is complicated, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. We must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\u000aAs readers reacted to Mr. Zuckerbergs post on Saturday, the CEO took to the comments section to address a handful of specific questions. He rejected the idea that Facebook identify itself as a media company because its primary use is connecting friends. News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance, he said.\u000aThe election has forced Facebook to reckon with the way the platform has shaped political discourse through its news feed, the central river of information, images, videos and news that is visited most often by Facebooks users.\u000aMr. Zuckerbergs weekend post amplified comments he made Thursday that the accusation Facebook influenced the election was a pretty crazy idea.\u000aFacebook has often expressed pride in the way it can shape users actions and purchase decisions, and has used that to generate billions of dollars in advertising revenue. But Mr. Zuckerbergs post contends Facebooks power is limited in shaping political views.\u000aFacebook has described themselves as a neutral platform... but theyre creating this product that delivers news to people and thats sort of traditionally associated with media companies, said Michelle De Mooy, an acting director of the privacy team at the Center for Democracy \u005cu0026 Technology, a nonprofit and nonpartisan tech advocacy organization in Washington, D.C.\u000aFacebooks power as a source of information raises questions of whether it should force its users to see opposing views or hire an ombudsman who can oversee news on the platform, she said.\u000aAbout 44% of Americans get at least some of their news from Facebook, according to Pew Research. Prompts from the company this year encouraged more than two million users to register to vote and, Mr. Zuckerberg said, the company estimates it got a similar number of people to vote who might have stayed home otherwise.\u000aA 2012 study by Facebook showed that the companys messages to users directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behavior of millions of people.\u000aCandidates, notably Donald Trump, used Facebook to connect directly with voters. Some of Mr. Trumps posts ignited debate within Facebook over whether they should be removed for violating the companys decency standards.\u000aThe algorithms underlying the news feed reward posts that drive a lot of engagement, in the form of shares, likes and comments. But that same formula encourages fake news, hoaxes and misinformation, according to critics, which include former and current Facebook employees, who are openly disturbed by the election of Mr. Trump.\u000aAnother concern is that Facebooks algorithm puts its users in a filter bubble where they only hear news and information from people who agree with them. Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly rejected that assessment, including on Saturday.\u000aSaturday, Mr. Zuckerberg said he was proud of the role Facebook played in connecting voters with candidates and fostering discussion about the election. A lot of that [dialogue] may not have happened without Facebook.

VALBUQUERQUE, NM  \u000aA former inmate of the New Mexico prison system is suing a senior chaplain of the corrections department and other prison officials for not allowing her to practice Satanism behind bars. \u000aIn her lawsuit, Monica Lujan claims that shes been a Satanist since the age of 13 and was just released from the New Mexico Womens Correctional Facility in Grants. \u000aAccording to court records, Lujan was serving a three-year sentence for low level drug crimes and forgery. \u000aLujan says during her stay at the facility, she was denied the right to have a Satanic bible several times. \u000aAccording to her lawsuit, Lujan claims that prison officials told her that Satanism was prohibited and that she faced retaliation for being a believer. \u000aThe New Mexico ACLU is aiding Lujan in her legal fight. \u000aThis is a case that strikes at the heart of questions of religious freedom, ACLU Executive Director Peter Simonson said. \u000aThe staff at the facility were disapproving of her religion and were denying her ability to practice that religion. \u000aThe lawsuit continues, saying that almost all of Lujans belongings were taken when officers found photocopies of the Satanic bible, a prayer book, and a drawing of a pentagram in her bunk. \u000aLujan claims that seizure left her with just one pair of underwear, that she says she wore for four months. \u000aWe would expect that our client would have been treated the same as anyone else who practices any other religion, Simonson said. \u000aThe government doesnt really have the ability to pick and choose which religion its going to side with, or which religion its going to favor. \u000aAlex Sanchez, the Deputy Secretary of Administrative Support for the New Mexico Department of Corrections, wouldnt comment about the case. \u000aBut Sanchez did say that inmates in the prison system are allowed to practice Satanism behind bars, as long as religious items and rituals arent a threat to security. \u000aWe recognize multiple religions, that includes holy days, property inmates are allowed to have, and how they practice that religion, Sanchez said. \u000aSanchez also said that records show Lujan never claimed any property relating to her religion, such as a bible or other religious items. \u000aThe Corrections Corporation of America is also listed as a defendant in the suit. CCA is a private company that helps the state run some of its facilities.\u000aMugshot of Monica Lujan.

Vhen it became clear in the early hours of Wednesday that Donald Trump was going to be the next president of the US, Florian Philippot, chief strategist of Frances far-right Front National, tweeted: Their world is collapsing. Ours is being built. Amid the euphoria and self-aggrandisement, there is a scarily credible proposition.\u000a\u000aWho are they whose world is collapsing? Arguably, the whole American-centred order created from the ruins of the second world war. And who are the new forces that Philippot is so confident will build on its ruins? They are in fact rather old forces: the ethnic nationalists whose logic brought the world to such a state by 1945 that a whole new order had to be built.\u000a\u000aIn Flann OBriens parodic novel The Poor Mouth there is a map of the world as seen by poor Gaelic peasants. It comes with a compass marking the four directions: west, west, west and west. This compass might also serve for the map of the world that most Europeans have had in their heads. For all the attempts of the EU to become an independent superpower, we have continued to look west for leadership. There has been an assumption that the US is the defining power, the one whose actions, good and bad, give the world its essential shape. Now that assumption has been pulled from under us. Trumps victory was forged in part by his stated desire that the US should no longer be the worlds policeman and arbiter C and that victory in itself shows us that, whatever the new presidents intentions, the US is in no shape to play those roles.\u000a\u000aEarly on Wednesday morning, the TV anchors rolled out the cliched phrase that comes unbidden to the lips on these occasions: Donald Trump is the next president of the United States and leader of the free world. A line from Elbows song came to mind: The leaders of the free world are just little boys throwing stones. For two things are clear: there is no free world any more and, if there were, Trump would certainly not be its leader.\u000a\u000aThat very phrase, in all its pomposity, once delineated not just a place but an idea. The free world in the cold war was the US, the anglophone countries, Japan and western Europe, and the American president got the title of its leader in much the same way that a new pope automatically becomes bishop of Rome. It came with the job, and it was not just an honorific. It had content. The western world order was built on US military, economic and ideological power. The US was the essential member, and de facto leader, not just of Nato but of multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation. And this free world seemed to be dramatically expanding. After the fall of the Berlin Wall it even looked like a world, stretching as it did around the planet.\u000a\u000aAnd now? The title leader of the free world being bestowed on Trump is like British monarchs styling themselves kings of France until the early 19th century, or one of Trumps own beauty queens being named Miss Universe. It is an absurdity. To be fair to Trump, he doesnt want it. His America First slogan is, among other things, a disavowal of any ambition to lead the world. But even if Trump did want to see himself this way, nobody else would. For in the American crisis that Trump embodies, the whole concept of a US-centred world order has imploded. There may be no western world any more, and if there is it is not at all clear in what sense many of its citizens are going to be free.\u000a\u000aIn this great disruption, Trump is as much an effect as a cause. The final act may be dramatic, but the play has been on for a while. There have been two successive models of a US-led world order C one ended in triumph, one in disarray. The first was of course the cold war, with its binary division of the world into competing hegemonies. There was no other possible leader for the western hemisphere C as Britain discovered in the Suez crisis, the US alone could dictate the terms on which other countries, even those with delusions of grandeur, operated their foreign policies and military engagements. This should not be seen, in rosy retrospect, as a golden era. It had its horrors and its follies. Europeans were often uneasy under the American umbrella, during the Vietnam war, for example, or Ronald Reagans nuclear buildup. But the perceived Soviet threat meant that US leadership was never itself threatened.\u000a\u000aThe second version was the era of imperial hubris when the US thought of itself not only as the sole superpower but (in the typical imperial manner) as the universal civilisation. It is increasingly hard to remember, but there was a period in which even Russia seemed to be a nascent eastern America, taking its burgers from McDonalds, its economics from Chicago, its loans from the US-led World Bank, and its political direction from Washington. Ideologically, the US formula (liberal democracy + deregulated markets + free trade = the end of history) was unstoppably ascendant. American prestige was so high that no one thought twice about, for example, having Bill Clinton as the final arbiter of the Northern Ireland peace process. Something that was technically an internal UK problem. It was what the leader of the free world did.\u000a\u000aWe know, of course, that this hubris was followed by the Iraq war and its brutal exposure of the belief that anywhere in the world could be transformed (with the help of a quick, clean invasion) into a little America. We know, too, that George W Bushs follies created huge fissures in the facade of American leadership. But it should be borne in mind that the Europeans remained almost desperate to restore the status quo. The rapture that greeted the then presidential candidate Barack Obama in Berlin in July 2008, with more than 100,000 people gathering to adore him at the Victory Column, suggested that much of the free world was still dreaming of another JFK to whom fealty could be offered. The reign of the neocons was seen as an unfortunate episode in an enduring marriage.\u000a\u000aIch bin ein Berliner: US president John F Kennedy gives his historic speech in Berlin on 26 June 1963. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\u000a\u000aBut Obama (and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton) could never fully restore American leadership. The ability of the US to project its power has never recovered from the Iraq disaster. The hesitations and confusions that characterised the US responses to the Arab spring were not merely a function of weak leadership. They reflected the new realities of the inability of the US to shape a messy world to its desires and the unwillingness of Americans to let their sons and daughters die?trying.\u000a\u000aBehind all the bluster about restoring Americas standing as the global alpha male, Donald Trump seems to understand these realities. His response is typically incoherent, a strange mix of anti-militarist isolationism and militarist unilateralism. But his confusion is not unique: George W Bush also won the presidency as an isolationist and we know how that worked?out.\u000a\u000aWhats different about Trump is that he wants to follow his America First logic in every direction, specifically into trade policy and the destruction of the Paris climate change accord. And he will bring to this a mindset that cannot be appeased, even if other leaders are minded to try to do so. He simultaneously imagines the US as pathetically weak, kicked around by its trade partners and robbed blind by its military allies, and as immensely strong, able to dictate the terms of all of its engagements with the rest of the world. Thats a formula not for deal-making, but for a toxic cocktail of paranoia and petulance that no one is going to drink.\u000a\u000aThe world cant wait around this time and hope for a new Obama to ride in and restore the natural order of American leadership. The old Obama couldnt even do that, and after a minimum of four years of President Trump the world will be a much more anarchic place. With Trumps election, the US has lost for a generation the claim that underlay its supremacy: the claim to be the shining light of democracy and tolerance. If there is a world that the US leads now, it is the increasingly unfree world of the new managed democracies, in which ethnic nationalism and media control fuel elected dictatorships.\u000a\u000aWho can now take up that banner of open democracy thrown aside by the US? Perhaps the spectre of Donald Trump, and of the Donald Trumps within its own borders, will scare the European Union into the realisation that it is the only large bloc left in which a revived social contract can offer the hope of real equality without which democracy cannot survive.\u000a\u000aThe EU has a short time in which to grow up and realise that it no longer has a benign big brother to the west. All it can look to is itself and?the lesson it learned in its darkest days. It is?the lesson the Americans are now teaching themselves: that absolute hopelessness corrupts?absolutely.

VThere are very few people left in this fine nation who Donald Trump hasn't insulted, and now the incredibly long list includes Beyonc and Jay Z.\u000aAt a rally in Reno, Nevada, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's recent get-out-the-vote rally featuring the artists. "On quick notice, we didnt bring any so-called stars along D we didnt need them," he said. "The reason Hillary has to do that is, nobody comes for her. She cant fill a room. Thats almost like a form of cheating, right?"\u000aOf course, it doesn't really matter what Trump's opinion of celebrity supporters is, because he doesn't really have any. In addition to Bey and Jay, Clinton counts Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Kerry Washington, Demi Lovato, Lena Dunham, and Chlo? Grace Moretz in her corner, just to name a few. Trump has Aaron Carter and Scott Baio.\u000aTrump further used his rally to criticize Jay Z's use of profanity. "He used every word in the book last night," he told the Reno crowd. "He used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, 'I did not like Donald Trump's lewd language.' My lewd language. I tell you what, I've never said what he said in my life."\u000aThis sentiment riffs off an attempt to use the art of Clinton's supporters against the candidate. Previously, Trump supporter Betsey McCaughey attempted to insult Beyonc's language as an attempt to absolve Trump of his notorious comments on the #TrumpTapes.\u000a"I wanted to point something out," said McCaughey while defending Trump back in October. "Hillary Clinton expresses that she finds the language on that bus horrific, but in fact she likes language like this. Quote, 'I came to slay bitch, when he F me good I take his ass to Red Lobster.'"\u000aIn regard to both stories, we anxiously await Bey's response of dignified silence.\u000aWith Election Day less than 48 hours away, be sure to read our our piece on how to vote, and then check out our latest video series: Dear Future President.\u000aRelated: We Polled Young Americans About the Election, And This Is What They Had to Say

VWrestling \u000aFormer WWE Tag Team Champions  and formerly two-thirds of The Shield  Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins team up on Monday Night Raw this week to face best friends Chris Jericho and WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens. As the former Shield brothers try to put their rough history aside to function as a team, Jeri-KO will undoubtedly try to prove that their bond as BFFs is too strong for Rollins and Reigns to overcome. As WWE tours through Europe, the outcome of this tag team match will almost certainly have ramifications for the Survivor Series.\u000aSeth Rollins seems like the obvious choice to take the fifth spot on Team Raw for the Mens 5-on-5 Traditional Elimination Tag Team Match. But two spots remain for the team captained by Raw Womens Champion Charlotte, and no one has been announced to join the Raw Tag Team Champions. Assuming Paige and Sasha Banks arent in the running, the three women competing for the final two spots on the Womens team include Alicia Fox, Dana Brooke and Summer Rae. Of course, WWE could use this as an excuse to bring up a competitor from NXT, like current champion Asuka. Likely candidates to join The New Day on Team Raw include Enzo and Big Cass, Gallows and Anderson, Sheamus and Cesaro, The Golden Truth and The Shining Stars.\u000aWho will join The New Day at Survivor Series? [Image via WWE]\u000aThis will be the first Monday Night Raw in several weeks to go without an appearance from either Brock Lesnar or Bill Goldberg. Since Goldbergs return to WWE will headline WWE Survivor Series 2016, there will sure to be plenty of mention of the men who last faced each other at WrestleMania 20. With what should be a very hot crowd in Glasgow at the SSE Hydro, Commissioner Stephanie McMahon and General Manager Mick Foley have the potential for a really fantastic episode of WWE Raw.\u000aRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR\u000aWWE Hell In A Cell 2016 Results: Charlotte Defeats Sasha Banks In Main Event\u000aWWE NXT Results: Samoa Joe Is Injured  Shinsuke Nakamuras Era Of Strong Style Begins\u000aWWE Monday Night Raw Results: Roman Reigns, Jeri-KO, Charlotte \u005cu0026 5 Others Named For Survivor Series\u000aWWE SmackDown Live Results: Huge Announcements For Survivor Series And WWE TLC\u000aAJ Styles Wins Main Event At WWE No Mercy 2016  Why Did The Title Match Open The Show?\u000aWWE CWC Results: Daniel Bryan Moved To Tears As Round 3 Of WWEs Cruiserweight Classic Begins\u000aComplete WWE Backlash 2016 Results  New Champions Crowned: AJ Styles, Becky Lynch, Heath Slater And Rhyno\u000aWWE: Bobby Roode Is First To Join New NXT Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic  6 Teams Announced So Far\u000aTotal Bellas Series Premiere Recap: Daniel Bryan Retirement, Nikki Bella Injury, And John Cenas Insane House Rules\u000aWWE Predictions: Which Superstars Will Represent Raw And SmackDown In Survivor Series Matches?\u000aUpdated WWE Survivor Series 2016 Card\u000aBrock Lesnar vs. Goldberg\u000aKevin Owens, Roman Reigns, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, \u005cu0026 TBA vs. AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Randy Orton, Bray Wyatt \u005cu0026 Baron Corbin  5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Mens Elimination Match\u000aCharlotte, Bayley, Nia Jax \u005cu0026 TBA vs. Nikki Bella, Becky Lynch, Alexa Bliss, Carmella \u005cu0026 Naomi  5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Womens Elimination Match\u000aThe New Day \u005cu0026 TBA vs. Rhyno and Heath Slater, The Hype Bros, American Alpha, The Usos \u005cu0026 TBA  10-on-10 Traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination Match\u000aDolph Ziggler vs. TBA  WWE Intercontinental Championship Open Challenge\u000aThree traditional Survivor Series Elimination Matches are in the process of being set up for this years event, and Lesnar vs. Goldberg has been booked for the main event.

VIf you're deciding whether or not you can afford to make the leap from renting to buying a home, many factors can help you decide: Do you have a high credit score? How much debt are you holding? Have you saved up for down payment? \u000a While your situation may never be perfect - it's  okay if you still have student loans! - there's one major sign that you're absolutely not ready to buy a house: You don't have an emergency fund. \u000a "A lot of times what I see is people will have money saved for a down payment and they end up putting the entire amount toward the down payment to afford the home, and have no money leftover," says Eric Roberge, CFP and founder of Beyond Your Hammock. \u000a When it comes to buying a home, the more you have in savings, the better. But the money you're putting away for a down payment - typically 20% of the price of the home - should remain completely separate from your  emergency fund. \u000a "You can never have enough money saved in the home buying year," Roberge says. "The process itself is complicated enough without having financial difficulties." \u000a Beyond paying for the actual house, becoming a homeowner inevitably  comes with hidden costs, so it's smart to have money leftover to pay for repairs, insurance, and house maintenance. Without that cushion, you risk putting yourself into debt trying to stay afloat or defaulting on your mortgage, both of which will cost in you in the future. \u000a "Unlike a rental arrangement with a one- or two-year contract and known termination clauses, defaulting on a mortgage can do major damage to your credit report," Certified financial planner Jonathan Meaney told Business Insider. \u000a At the end of the day, it's better to be safe than sorry. If your plan to afford a down payment involves purging your entire savings account, you might want to take a step back and reevaluate your financial goals. \u000a "Things are going to be expensive, so you want to have a buffer for that," Roberge says.

VA harrowing open letter was published by the Cheltenham Guardians after they spent two hours caring for a vulnerable young woman named Emily\u000aThe volunteers cared for the drunk woman and tracked down her friends\u000aDespite promises to come and pick her up, Emily's friends never showed \u000aEventually they called an ambulance to collect her, costing the NHS ?300\u000aVolunteers looking after a girl so drunk she had been sick on herself and could not remember where she was staying were mocked by the friends who abandoned her.\u000aA harrowing open letter was published by the Cheltenham Guardians after they spent two hours caring for a vulnerable young woman named Emily who was left by her friends during a night out on Friday. \u000aThe group cared for the heavily intoxicated Emily while they attempted to track down her friends who thought it was funny she was unable to look after herself.\u000aGuardian Emma attempted to keep Emily warm in the rain whilst waiting for an ambulance shortly after 4am on Saturday morning \u000aDuring the course of the night Emily was cared for by four different groups of volunteers and emergency service staff and was eventually taken away in an ambulance, costing the NHS ?300.\u000aDespite repeated calls to her friends, who promised to come and collect her, they never came back.\u000aThe letter starts: Dear friends of Emily, You may have started your night together enjoying the vibrant bars and clubs of Cheltenham, but somewhere along the way you lost your friend, you lost Emily.\u000aALCOHOL COSTS THE NHS ?3.5BN A YEAR \u000aEach year about 1.4 million of all ambulance call outs are alcohol related (stock photo)\u000aAlcohol costs the NHS an estimated ?3.5bn per year, according to the latest figures.\u000a Health and Social Care Information Centre research suggests this roughly amounts to about ?120 for every taxpayer.\u000aThe treatment of alcohol-related conditions costs the NHS about 3.6 per cent of its annual budget.\u000aAbout 35 per cent, 1.4 million, of all ambulance call outs each year are alcohol related. \u000aThe NHS is not the only emergency service to bear the brunt of binge drinking. \u000aUp to 80 per cent of weekend arrests are alcohol-related , and just over half of violent crime is committed under the influence, according to the Institute of Alcohol Studies. \u000aWhen we found Emily she had already been sick in the back of a taxi and was in the care of taxi marshals. It's fair to say she had seen better days.\u000aWhen the Cheltenham Guardians collected Emily from the taxi marshals it was raining and she had been sick. One volunteers got Emilys phone and called the people she had been with to come and pick her up.\u000aWhen we contacted you, you told us that you would wait outside a club on Regent Street for her. We were keen to return her to her friends and into your care, says the writer.\u000aWe took Emily to the club and you were not there. We waited, and still you didn't come. We contacted you again as we were concerned for Emily's welfare. It was cold, raining and she was poorly.\u000aYou found it funny that your friend was in a state, you told us again that you would come for her so we waited, and still you never came.\u000aWe were keen to get her to safety yet only you held the key, you knew where Emily was, you knew where Emily was staying yet still you never came.\u000aThe Street Pastors, volunteers from local churches, were then called in to help the Guardians with the poorly woman.\u000aWe were keen to get her to safety yet only you held the key, you knew where Emily was, you knew where Emily was staying yet still you never came, states the writer.\u000aEmily told us that she was staying in Montpellier, that's all she remembered. It was dark, raining hard, you knew where we were yet still you never came. We walked Emily to Montpellier, we called you again and you promised you would take a taxi and help us help your friend yet still you never came. \u000aCheltenham Guardians are a partner in the care response to the night time economy in the town and often look after vulnerable, extremely intoxicated revelers \u000aThe group often shares pictures and stories of the people they have helped on their Facebook page \u000aWith Cheltenham races in town, and the England verses Scotland football game on, the group were pulling an extra shift in the town centre between 11pm and 7am to help out the stretched emergency services. \u000aBut eventually, just before 4am, the group had no choice but to call an ambulance.\u000aIn a damning final few words to Emilys so-called friends the Cheltenham Guardians wrote: I hope you read this and understand that you tied up valuable resources for over two hours and forced the attendance of an emergency ambulance at a cost to the NHS of ?300. Most of all you were not a friend of Emily's.\u000aI hope you enjoyed your night at the expense of us, South Western Ambulance Service and Emily. Great job guys, you can be really proud of yourselves. \u000aMailOnline has contacted Cheltenham Guardians for further comment. \u000aEmily's story has gone viral since it was posted on Facebook with more than 1,500 shares and hundreds of comments chastising the friends who abandoned the young woman \u000aTHE CHELTENHAM GUARDIANS FACEBOOK POST IN FULL: \u000aDear friends of Emily. \u000aYou may have started your night together enjoying the vibrant bars and clubs of Cheltenham, but somewhere along the way you lost your friend, you lost Emily. When we found Emily she had already been sick in the back of a taxi and in the care of taxi marshals.\u000aIt's fair to say she had seen better days.

We told you that we would need to call Emily an ambulance as we could help her no further, we did not have the answers, you did, yet you found it funny, you mocked us, and still you never came. \u000aWe called an ambulance, and they came. Friends of Emily, we looked after your friend for two hours. We cared for her unconditionally whilst you purposefully gave us the runaround, hindered our progress, and despite our pleas you never came. One day you may find yourself in our care. \u000aWe will care for you unconditionally, we will ensure you are safe. I hope you read this and understand that you tied up valuable resources for over two hours and forced the attendance of an emergency ambulance at a cost to the NHS of ?300. Most of all you were not a friend of Emily's.\u000aI hope you enjoyed your night at the expense of us, South Western Ambulance Service and Emily. Great job guys, you can be really proud of yourselves. Picture: Guardian Emma attempts to keep Emily warm in the rain whilst waiting for an ambulance shortly after 4am this morning.

VTV \u000aWill The Real Housewives of New Jersey actually see the cast members come together and make a deal on tonights season 7 reunion show episode? On Sunday afternoon, Jacqueline Laurita posted a tweet that states that she made a deal with her co-stars Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Siggy Flicker, and Dolores Catania at the reunion show.\u000aThe deal seems to involve not publicly bashing one another after the seasons conclusion. Jacqueline tweeted that as she agreed to at the reunion show, after the final episode and blog, there will be peace on her end. Jacqueline promised that shell stick to the deal she made.\u000aAs agreed upon at #rhonj reunion, after tonight's final episode \u005cu0026 blog, I'll stick to the deal we made. There will be peace on my end. ??????\u000a Jacqueline Laurita (@JacLaurita) November 13, 2016\u000aSome people praised Jacqueline for making the deal. One viewer tweeted to Jacqueline, Melissa and Teresa that she hopes that they all stick to the agreement, as the latest seasons ugliness has been hard to watch.\u000a@JacLaurita @Teresa_Giudice @melissagorga I hope you all stick to it. As a fan it has been ugly to watch.\u000a AnnieB (@AnnieBinTX) November 13, 2016\u000aThere were several people, however, who predicted that the peace wont last or even start. One viewer pointed out that every year, the cast members promise to change.\u000a@JacLaurita doesnt this always get said ????\u000a Sammy Theasby (@samanthatheasby) November 13, 2016\u000aA preview for part 2 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey season 7 shows that viewers will see Teresa Giudice and Jacqueline Laurita continue to very heatedly argue with one another. At one point, Teresa even calls Jacqueline a b**ch.\u000aYou are a disgusting, low, dirty, b**ch.\u000aThe womens husbands even get involved, with Chris Laurita seemingly wondering when Teresa and her husband, Joe Giudice, will take responsibility for their crimes.\u000aAt what point are they going to take responsibility for what they did?\u000aAt another point, Jacqueline, seemingly in reference to Joe and Melissa Gorga, says that theyre going to eat their words if they go there. Joe speaks up to defend his wife.\u000aI dont eat any words honey. A friend doesnt do what you did.\u000aJoe may have been referring to the moment during the casts Vermont trip when Jacqueline yelled out that Melissa has had four nose jobs. Another preview of part 2 of the reunion show shows that Jacquelines accusation against Melissa will be a hot topic. Host Andy Cohen asks Melissa if she really has had four nose jobs. When Melissa denies that she has had four nose jobs and Jacqueline questions if it was really one done by two different doctors, Melissa yells out that its her business to tell.\u000aWhy do you care! It was the worst kept secret but it was my secret to tell!\u000aAs Melissa yells at Jacqueline, Jacqueline calls her Pinocchio and says that she has the incredible shrinking nose. Melissa for years had publicly claimed that her nose looks different because of makeup contouring,\u000aJacqueline Slams Melissa As A Sneak, Liar, and Manipulator! https://t.co/VqPRgZCbMQ via @www.realmrhousewife.com pic.twitter.com/KiMi3ONF95\u000a Brightly (@Brightly5) October 10, 2016\u000aJacqueline explains that she pointed out Melissas nose job as a way to show that she can lie with a straight face. Melissa calls Jacqueline a s**t friend and accuses her of being the one who has had the most plastic surgeries. After Jacqueline adds in that Teresas also a liar who actually went to to jail for lying, Teresa shoots back that shes a very low, dirty b**ch. Teresa then makes fun of Jacquelines appearance.\u000aLook at her clown-looking face. Shes probably the clowns that are coming around our house. No, shes a clown. Shes a wolf in lambs clothing but shes a wolf with rabies.\u000aWill viewers also see more of Teresas accusation that Jacqueline, along with their former co-star and her sister-in-law Caroline Manzo, had something to do with her federal case and ensuing imprisonment? On part 1 of the reunion show, Teresa dropped the shocking accusation that Jacqueline, perhaps with the help of Caroline, tipped off the feds. Jacqueline vehemently denied that she tipped off the government. Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania, friends of both Jacqueline and Teresa, were visibly shocked by the accusation.\u000a Grab your favorite bag of The Little Kernel \u005cu0026 tune in tonight 10:00 P.M. Bravo Reunion Part I: Real Housewives of New Jersey . . . ????Go to TheLittleKernel.com for locations near you! ???? . . . ????????www.realmrhousewife.com/2016/11/04/rhonj-season-7-reunion-jacqueline-teresa-fight/???????? . . . #rhonj #bravo #thelittlekernel #popcorn #savethedrama #norespectforliars #letsgetreadytorumble\u000aA photo posted by Jacqueline Laurita (@jaclaurita) on Nov 6, 2016 at 10:12am PST\u000aIn her blog post recapping part 1, Teresa clarified that she believes Jacqueline communicated with people who were set on hurting her and her family.\u000aIs Jacqueline Laurita the reason Joe and I had legal problems? No. Were Jacqueline and others involved in communicating with some of the people that set out to hurt Joe and I? YesDid it bother me that someone who I thought my was my friend was in cahoots with people that were trying to destroy my family and hurt my children? AbsolutelyShe ran out of Rails in the season finale because she is a coward, she knows what shes done to hurt my family, and she knows that I know.\u000aAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, Caroline Manzo, when asked about Teresas accusation, indicated that its so foolish that it doesnt even deserve a response.\u000aIn her blog, Teresa also repeated her claim that Jacqueline Laurita played a part in trying to expose Melissa Gorgas past history as a stripper, a claim that Melissa, during part 1 of the reunion show, backed up for the first time. Teresa promised that things will become a lot clearer when part 2 of the reunion show airs.\u000aWhen she didnt show up at the Season 3 reunion, its because she knew what she had done to Melissa, and she didnt want to be confronted about it. Youll see a lot more of me confronting Jacqueline in the second part of the reunion, and things will become a lot clearer.\u000aHours prior to part 2 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey season 7 reunion show airing, Teresa Giudice teased that viewers will get their answers to what they wondered about after last weeks episode tonight.\u000aPart 2 of #RHONJ Reunion tonight at 10pm on @Bravotv .. if you had questions after last week, tonight you will get your answers pic.twitter.com/1NOqh2mg2s\u000a Teresa Giudice (@Teresa_Giudice) November 13, 2016

VMegyn Kelly writes about Roger Ailes final days at Fox News in her new memoir Settle For More\u000aThe Fox News host writes that Ailes 'engineered hit pieces' about her online when she refused to publicly support him \u000aKelly then made the decision to speak with the Murdochs about the alleged harassment she had experienced from Ailes in the past \u000a'I could ensure that the owners of Fox News Channel ... understood they might actually have a predator running their company,' writes Kelly\u000aAiles stepped down as CEO of Fox News two weeks after Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against him and the network \u000aMegyn Kelly details the final weeks of Roger Ailes' two-decade career at Fox News in her new memoir Settle For More, and reveals just how strained her relationship had become with her boss towards the end.\u000aThe popular host of The Kelly File claims that after Gretchen Carlson filed her sexual harassment suit against Ailes in July, the then-CEO asked Kelly to speak out publicly in support of him, just like every other Fox News personality was doing at the time.\u000aKelly refused to do this however, and writes in her book that as a result Ailes 'engineered hit pieces' about her online.\u000aThat is when Kelly realized she had to make a decision she writes, and determine whether she would stay quiet or finally speak out. \u000aShe chose the latter, and while the rest of her co-workers were praising Ailes, she went and spoke to his bosses, specifically News Corp executive co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch.\u000a'I could ensure that the owners of Fox News Channel - Rupert Murdoch and his sons - understood they might actually have a predator running their company,' writes Kelly in a passage from her book that was published in the The New York Times. \u000aScroll down for video\u000aEnd of the road: Megyn Kelly writes about Roger Ailes final days at Fox News in her new memoir Settle For More\u000aIt was previously revealed that Kelly's memoir would feature a section detailing the harassment she experienced when she first began working for Ailes at Fox News.\u000aKelly's decision to go back and add a section about Ailes' harassment was made after her book had already been completed and sent off to her publisher.\u000aThe book is being released by HarperCollins, which is owned by Fox News' parent company News Corp. \u000aShe writes in the book that at the time of the alleged harassment she spoke with a lawyer, but decided to keep quiet in the end.\u000a'If I caused a stink, my career would likely be over,' writes Kelly. \u000aRadar Online was the first to obtain the section of the memoir in which Kelly details Ailes' alleged offenses and misconduct, two weeks ahead of the book's November 15 release.\u000aRumors first began to circulate back in July that Kelly was one of the women who had allegedly been sexually harassed by Ailes while working at Fox News.\u000aThese claims came after it was reported that Kelly had agreed to speaking with lawyers investigating claims of sexual harassment at the network after Carlson filed her lawsuit.\u000aClaim: The Fox News host writes that Ailes (above) 'engineered hit pieces' about her\u000aCarlson ultimately settled that suit for a reported $20million, a little less than half of the $42million that Ailes is said to have walked out the door with as part of his severance package.\u000aAiles has also denied the sexual harassment claims that Carlson made in her lawsuit.\u000aSome of the offenses detailed in Carlson's complaint, including Ailes' offensive and lewd comments, the suggestion of a sexual relationship with his employee and remarks about the clothing and body shape of Fox News' female talent, are remarkably similar to the incidents Kelly writes about in her memoir.\u000a'There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger's office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me - veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the 'very sexy bras' I must have and how he'd like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice,'' writes Kelly in one passage.\u000aShe also writes that Ailes crossed a line in early 2006 when he began 'trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.'\u000aKelly does on to claim in the passage that when she shoved Ailes off her and rebuffed his advances, he 'ominously' asked her: 'When is your contract up?'\u000aHe then went in for another kiss writes Kelly.\u000aReaching out: Kelly writes that she spoke with Lachlan Murdoch (above with wife Sarah at his father Rupert's March wedding) about Ailes\u000aThe misconduct and harassment only lasted for six months according to Kelly, with the host explaining that after she spoke with a supervisor and reported Ailes the two began a decade-long relationship that was strictly professional.\u000aTen years after her final encounter with Ailes however, Kelly was once again forced to speak up when she witnessed firsthand the 'intense campaign' launched by her former boss to get the network's talent to publicly praise him in the wake of Carlson's lawsuit.\u000aAlmost here: Kelly's book will be released next week \u000a'I was approached several times, and several times I refused,' writes Kelly.\u000aShe then adds: 'There was no way I was going to lie to protect him.'\u000aIt is unlikely that Kelly will speak publicly about Ailes' alleged harassment beyond what she details in the book though, as the host tends to avoid getting caught up in public feuds.\u000aAiles and his lawyer Susan Estrich swiftly released a response to Kelly's bombshell claims last week, stating: 'Mr. Ailes denies her allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct of any kind.' \u000aEstrich's statement also detailed some of the praise that Kelly had lavished on her boss in a recent interview with Charlie Rose.\u000aUnfortunately, Estrich and Ailes incorrectly claimed that Kelly's comments were made 'on the Charlie Rose program' just 'one year ago.'\u000aThe comments were actually made when Kelly was profiled by Rose for an episode of CBS Sunday Morning that aired in April.\u000aIn that interview Kelly said of Ailes: 'I really care about Roger. And he has been nothing but good to me. And he's been very loyal. And he's had my back. And he's looked out for me.'

VBarack Obama to the rescue! With thousands of women terrified by Donald Trumps statement to ban abortion, the former president is determined to pass a new rule that will protect Planned Parenthoods funding  permanently! Read all about it, here!\u000aAs far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, Im pro-life, said Donald Trump, 70, in the midst of his Feb. campaign at the University of Houston. Im totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. Women across America are terrified that the business mogul will defund the establish thats provided so many with birth control, cancer screenings, and abortions. Thankfully, Barack Obama, 55, has a plan that will protects womens (pro-choice) rights, and its called, Title X.\u000aTitle X says that states cannot withhold family planning money from certain recipients for any reason other than the providers ability to deliver services to program beneficiaries in an effective manner, according to the Huffington Post. This means states can no longer vote to defund Planned Parenthood and the sometimes controversial services it provides. States like Texas, Florida, and Louisiana have voted to defund the company in the past. Under Title X, women will not be asked to pay money for abortions for any reason.\u000aThanks to the Obama administration, women will still be able to access the birth control they need to plan their families, and the cancer screenings they need to stay healthy, said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, to the news website. This is fantastic news for womens rights  and their health! In Florida alone, there are an estimated 84% of pregnant women living with Zika! The mosquito-driven disease can cause the birth defect of microcephaly, which is incurable. Microcephaly is a condition where the baby is born with an abnormally smaller head, thus leading to poorer brain developments. In our humble opinion, women should never be told what to do with their bodies!\u000aHollywoodLifers, what do you think of the Title X rule? Do you support it?

VFor the first time in 70 years, the largest supermoon closest to Earth will emerge overnight on Nov. 14, according to NASA.\u000a This years three full moons from October, November and December will make up the undeniably beautiful supermoon as it orbits close to Earth, Space.com reported.\u000a Novembers "Beaver Moon" is expected be the closest and brightest supermoon of 2016. It will also be the largest since 1948, scientist Bob Berman told Space.com. \u000a What is a supermoon?\u000a The term supermoon comes from when a full moon is within 90% closer to Earth than average during its orbit, NASA astronomers said.\u000a Why do supermoons occur?\u000a Supermoons occur because of the moon's elliptical orbit, which is roughly 30,000 miles closer to Earth. Its the closest point  also known as Perigee  that will create the supermoon when the sun, Earth and moon align, NASA officials said. They also said the moons orbit would cause it to appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter in the sky.\u000aOn Monday, Nov. 14, the moon will orbit closer to the earth than at any time since 1948, named a 'supermoon.'\u000a When and where is the best time to view the November supermoon?\u000a For skywatchers in the U.S. and Europe, the best times to view the November supermoon from your window or outside is Sunday starting at 8 p.m. and Monday at 8:52 a.m., NASA astronomers said.\u000a The Slooh Community Observatory will broadcast the supermoon for free on Nov. 13 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and Space.com will also stream it live throughout the night to Monday at 8:52 a.m., NASA astronomers said.\u000a How did the November supermoon get its name?\u000a Native Americans of the Algonquin tribe and colonists named Novembers full moon the Beaver Moon because they would set beaver traps to acquire fur for warmth, according to The Old Farmers Almanac.\u000aAn aeroplane flies past the London Eye wheel, and moon, a day before the "supermoon" spectacle in London, Britain on Nov. 13.\u000a Some Native Americans also called Novembers full moon the Full Frost Moon, the Almanac states.\u000a When is the December supermoon?\u000a Decembers "Cold Moon" will make up the third supermoon to close out the year. Astronomers expect it to reach its peak on Dec. 13 at 7:05 p.m.\u000a NASA officials in an Oct 14. blog post call the supermoon of Dec. 14 remarkable for a different reason, because its going to wipe out the view of the Geminid meteor shower," meaning skywatchers would be able to see Geminids per hour when the showers reach its peak.\u000a When is the next supermoon?\u000a Scientists predict the next Supermoon of this size, brightness and proximity wont come again until Nov. 25, 2034, at 10:33 a.m. according to NASA.

VKellyanne Conway, President-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager, said Sunday that Hillary Clinton should perhaps "take a look in the mirror" before blaming FBI Director James Comey for her unexpected loss. \u000a In recent days, Clinton's team has pinned blame on Comey, contending two letters he sent Congress several days before the election regarding Clinton's use of a private email server depressed potential Democratic voters and threw Trump the election. \u000a On Sunday, "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd asked Conway about the claim. \u000a "Do you believe Comey did have an impact? Whether a direct impact or not, do you believe that it had some help to your candidacy in the last 11 days?" he asked. \u000a Conway said it was "unfortunate" that Clinton, who she described as a "woman of enormous gifts and talents," was blaming the FBI director. \u000a "I just can't believe it's always somebody else's fault," Conway said. "Sometimes you just have to take a look in the mirror and reflect on what went wrong." \u000a Conway said polls were tightening before Comey's first letter to Congress, and noted that the former secretary of state's own campaign said at the time the email announcement was unlikely to change many minds. \u000a The political world was left in shock on election night when Trump defeated Clinton to secure the White House, a feat some pollsters had estimated had a 1% chance of taking place.

It was all just a big joke!\u000aAdding: No one actually expected me to win, especially me. I mean, I dont know s**t about running a country.\u000aAccording to one witness, Mr Trump threw the keys to the White House off the top of the Trump Tower, exclaiming F**k that s**t before rearranging his hairpiece and scoring a hooker.\u000aIn a historical victory over humanitarianism, Trump legitimately won the election against Hillary Clinton with absolutely no vote rigging at all.\u000aHis decision to stand down has shocked and disappointed his supporters, with one man in South Carolina dressed as Pepe the Frog losing consciousness in a gutter. Further scenes of chaos ensued across the United States with reports of NRA members shooting each other by mistake, pro-life campaigners having unprotected sex with abandon and one senior KKK member waving a Black Lives Matter placard in front of the Statue of Liberty.\u000aAt the time of writing the position of President is currently vacant. A spokesperson for the White House said:\u000aWell probably just put an ad on Craigslist or something.

VDonald Trump has defied all expectations from the very start of his presidential campaign more than a year ago. \u000aVery few people thought he would actually run, then he did. They thought he wouldn't climb in the polls, then he did. They said he wouldn't win any primaries, then he did. They said he wouldn't win the Republican nomination, then he did.\u000aFinally, they said there was no way he could compete for, let alone win, a general election.\u000aNow he's president-elect Trump.\u000aHere are five ways he pulled off what was unexpected by most and incomprehensible to many. \u000aTrump's white wave \u000aToss-ups were tossed aside. One after another, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina went to Mr Trump. \u000aThat left Mrs Clinton's blue firewall, and the firewall was eventually breached.\u000aThe Democrat's last stand largely rested on her strength in the Midwest. Those were states that had gone Democrat for decades, based in part on the support of black and working-class white voters. \u000aThose working-class white people, particularly ones without college education - men and women - deserted the party in droves. Rural voters turned out in high numbers, as the Americans who felt overlooked by the establishment and left behind by the coastal elite made their voices heard.\u000aWhile places like Virginia and Colorado held fast, Wisconsin fell - and with it Mrs Clinton's presidential hopes. \u000aWhen all is said and done, Mrs Clinton may end up winning the popular vote on the back of strong support in places like California and New York and closer-than-expected losses in solid-red states like Utah. \u000aThe Trump wave hit in the places it had to, however. And it hit hard.\u000aTeflon Donald\u000aMr Trump insulted decorated war veteran John McCain. \u000aHe picked a fight with Fox News and its popular presenter, Megyn Kelly. \u000aHe doubled down when asked how he once mocked the weight of a Hispanic beauty pageant winner. \u000aHe offered a half-hearted apology when the secret video surfaced of his boasting about making unwanted sexual advances towards women.\u000aHe gaffed his way through the three presidential debates with clearly lightly practised performances.\u000aNone of it mattered. While he took dips in the polls following some of the more outrageous incidents, his approval was like a cork - eventually bouncing back to the surface. \u000aPerhaps the various controversies came so hard and fast that none had time to draw blood. Maybe Mr Trump's personality and appeal was so strong, the scandals just bounced off. Whatever the reason, he was bulletproof. \u000aThe outsider\u000aHe ran against the Democrats. He also ran against the powers within his own party.\u000aHe beat them all. \u000aMr Trump built a throne of skulls out of his Republican primary opponents. Some, like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Ben Carson, eventually bent knee. The holdouts, like Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are now on the outside of their party looking in.\u000aAnd for the rest of the party insiders, from House Speaker Paul Ryan on down? Mr Trump didn't need their help - and, in fact, may have won because he was willing to take a stand against them. \u000aMr Trump's pox-on-them-all attitude is likely to have proved his independence and outsider status at a time when much of the American public reviled Washington (although not enough to keep them from re-electing most congressional incumbents running for re-election).\u000aIt was a mood some other national politicians sensed - Democrat Bernie Sanders, for instance, as well as Mr Cruz. No one, however, captured it more than Trump, and it won him the White House. \u000aThe Comey Factor\u000aThe polls clearly did a woeful job predicting the shape and preferences of the electorate, particularly in Midwestern states. In the final days of the campaign, however, the reality is that the polls were close enough that Mr Trump had a pathway to victory.\u000aThat pathway didn't look nearly as obvious about two weeks ago, before FBI director James Comey released his letter announcing that they were reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.\u000aTrue, the polls were tightening a bit, but Mr Trump's sharpest rise in the standings came in the weeks between that first letter and Mr Comey's second, in which he said he had put the investigation back on the shelf.\u000aIt seems likely that during that period, Mr Trump was able to successfully consolidate his base, bringing wayward conservatives back into the fold and shredding Mrs Clinton's hopes of offering a compelling closing message to US voters.\u000aOf course, Mr Comey's actions never would have been a factor if Mrs Clinton had decided to rely on State Department email servers for her work correspondence. That one is on her shoulders.\u000aTrusted his instincts\u000aMr Trump ran the most unconventional of political campaigns, but it turned out he knew better than all the experts. \u000aHe spent more on hats than on pollsters. He travelled to states like Wisconsin and Michigan that pundits said were out of reach. \u000aHe held massive rallies instead of focusing on door-knocking and get-out-the-vote operations. \u000aHe had a disjointed, sometimes chaotic national political convention that was capped by an acceptance speech that was more doom-and-gloom than any in modern US political history.\u000aHe was vastly outspent by the Clinton campaign, just as he was during the Republican primaries. He turned consensus wisdom about how to win the presidency on its head. \u000aAll of these decisions - and many more - were roundly ridiculed in "knowledgeable" circles. \u000aIn the end, however, they worked. Mr Trump and his closest confidants - his children and a few chosen advisers - will have the last laugh. And they'll do it from the White House.

VThe latest earthquake was farther away from the population center of Christchurch than the 2011 temblor (above), which killed more than 160 people.\u000aWELLINGTON, New Zealand  A powerful earthquake struck New Zealand near the city of Christchurch early Monday, with strong jolts causing some damage to buildings more than 120 miles away in the capital, Wellington.\u000aNew Zealand emergency services warned that a tsunami was possible and told people near the coast of the South Island to move to higher ground. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no immediate danger of a broader tsunami from the 7.4 magnitude quake.\u000aIn Wellington, 132 miles north of the quakes epicenter, power was knocked out in some places, and some windows smashed and some chimneys collapsed.\u000aThere were no immediate reports of any major damage or injuries in Christchurch.\u000aThe quake, which struck just after midnight Sunday, was centered 57 miles northeast of Christchurch, according to the US Geological Survey. It was at a relatively shallow depth of 6 miles. Earthquakes tend to be more strongly felt on the surface when theyre shallow.\u000aThe quake brought back memories of a 2011 earthquake that struck Christchurch, destroying much of the city and killing 185 people. But Mondays quake was much farther away from any major population centers.\u000aNew Zealand sits on the Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\u000aThe No. 8 Texas A\u005cu0026M Aggies lost to the Ole Miss Rebels on Saturday night. How does this loss impact the Top 10 of the College Football Playoff rankings?\u000aThe No. 8 Texas A\u005cu0026M Aggies were the fourth Top 10 team in the College Football Playoff rankings to lose in Week 11. Texas A\u005cu0026M lost at home to the Ole Miss Rebels on a Gary Wunderlich field goal with seconds left in the game.\u000aChaos in is full effect in Week 11 with Texas A\u005cu0026M, Clemson, Washington, and Auburn all losing on Saturday. Here is what the Top 10 of the College Football Playoff rankings could look like when they are released again on Tuesday night.\u000aAlabama Crimson Tide\u000aMichigan Wolverines\u000aOhio State Buckeyes\u000aClemson Tigers\u000aLouisville Cardinals\u000aWashington Huskies\u000aWisconsin Badgers\u000aPenn State Nittany Lions\u000aOklahoma Sooners\u000aColorado Buffaloes\u000aAlabama annihilated the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Crimson Tide remained undefeated and would retain the No. 1 ranking entering Week 12. Should Michigan beat the Iowa Hawkeyes in Iowa City, the Wolverines would be the No. 2 team in the country.\u000aOhio State crushed the Maryland Terrapins on Saturday afternoon. The Buckeyes would be the No. 3 team in the country. Clemson may have lost at home to the Pittsburgh Panthers, but the Tigers would only fall to No. 4 in next weeks poll.\u000aLouisville came on strong in the fourth quarter to hold off the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. The Cardinals have to be No. 5. Washingtons loss at home to the USC Trojans drops them to No. 6.\u000aWisconsins big win over the division rival Illinois Fighting Illini would have the Badgers in at No. 7. Penn State held on to beat the Indiana Hoosiers. The Nittany Lions would improve to No. 8.\u000aComing in at No. 9 would be the Big 12 powerhouse that is Oklahoma. Assuming they beat the lowly Arizona Wildcats, the No. 10 team in the country would be Colorado. What a time to be alive!

VWrestling \u000aWith Survivor Series a mere week away, WWE is really going to build it up on the final two television shows this week. Starting things off, Monday Night Raw is set to really get things going in a big way as there will be a couple of huge clashes taking place. One thing is that a couple of guys from Tuesday nights are set to show up before Team Red and Team Blue square off. Oh yeah, theres also the fact that Goldberg and Brock Lesnar will meet face-to-face for the first time in more than a decade.\u000aIn one week, Survivor Series will be all about brand supremacy as Monday Night Raw faces off against SmackDown LIVE. As of now, WWE has five interpromotional matches confirmed for the card and two of them will be for championship belts that could very well switch brands/shows.\u000aThe biggest match of all, though, is going to be one that pits one Raw superstar against another Raw superstar and it has been 12 years in the making. The official website for WWE revealed its preview for this Monday nights show and it looks as if Goldberg and Brock Lesnar are going to tangle.\u000aWill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar clash before Survivor Series?\u000aEver since Paul Heyman issued the challenge for Goldberg to return and face Brock Lesnar, The Man accepted and then traded appearances with the Beast Incarnate. At one point, Goldberg had time in the ring with Heyman and made short work of him, but not his opponent.\u000a[Image by WWE]\u000aFor weeks now, the two superstars have been confirmed to appear at the Keybank Center in Buffalo, New York, by the official page for WWE Live Events. Its hard to think that they will be in the same building and have no kind of interaction, but will it be civil or explosive?\u000aShane McMahon and Daniel Bryan come to Raw\u000aThe general managers and commissioners of Monday Night Raw and SmackDown LIVE have been mouthing off for weeks now, but things picked up last week. As reported by Inquisitr, Team Blue took Baron Corbin off the team and replaced him with none other than Shane McMahon.\u000a[Image by WWE]\u000aNow, Shane-O Mac and General Manager Daniel Bryan are heading to Raw to face off with Stephanie McMahon and Mick Foley as the two shows prepare for their big matches at Survivor Series. Things could get heated in a hurry as all four will look to stand by their brand.\u000aCan Team Red form a united front against SmackDown LIVE?\u000aJeri-KO (Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens) cant stand the former brothers of The Shield (Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins). The former brothers of The Shield are not fans of Jeri-KO and pretty much want to destroy them. Then, there is the fifth member of the team who is Braun Strowman and he doesnt like anyone.\u000aIf the members of Team Red cant stand to be around one another and stop fighting within, how can they possibly take on Team Blue?\u000aIs Sami Zayn about to bring the Intercontinental title to Team Red?\u000aDolph Ziggler issued the open challenge to any member of the Raw roster to challenge him for the Intercontinental Title atSurvivor Series. Sami Zayn defeated Rusev last week to win that title shot, but will he actually be able to bring the belt to Monday nights?\u000a[Image by WWE]\u000aBefore that match even happens, Ziggler will give The Miz a title rematch on this weeks SmackDown LIVE according to the official WWE preview. If The Miz ends up capturing the title back, one has to wonder if hed be willing to honor the match against Sami Zayn.\u000aCan The Brian Kendrick keep the Cruiserweight division under the Raw banner?\u000aWhile one belt may end up switching to Monday nights, another title has the possibility of switching to Tuesday nights. If The Brian Kendrick loses at Survivor Series, the Cruiserweight Title could go with Kalisto to SmackDown LIVE and that could have serious implications on many superstars.\u000aIf Kalisto were to win the Cruiserweight Title, not only would the belt switch brands, but the entire cruiserweight division would as well.\u000aOfficially, the 900th episode of SmackDown LIVE on Tuesday night will be the final WWE television show before Survivor Series on Nov. 20. Still, the company knows that Monday Night Raw is their flagship show and that the biggest storylines need to be wrapped up then. That includes Team Red and Team Blue squaring off one more time, two titles in limbo, and Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg finally meet face-to-face for the first time since WrestleMania XX.

VThis video brings road rage to a whole new level. \u000aIn a viral clip that began making the rounds on Sunday, a Donald Trump supporter harangued a black man in Memphis, Tennessee, after the black man supposedly cut him off while driving. \u000a"Black lives don't matter," the white driver says to a black driver, while coming over to his car and yelling at him through the open window. "There ain't no proof." \u000aHe adds, "Just cause you say something, don't mean nothing." \u000aAfter the white man yells at him for cutting him off, he says that the black man's driving maneuver makes him a "nigger." \u000aSource: Mic/Facebook Racist driver Source: Mic/Facebook\u000a"That makes you a nigger," the white man says about the man's driving. "That proves that black lives don't matter." \u000aThe man then begins to chant "Trump!" and then hushes his wife and tells her to "be a woman" when she tries to intervene. \u000aWhen the black driver asks the unidentified white man to tell him more about black people, the white driver says:\u000a"Black people were bought by a contract and we got ripped off because y'all should've got returned when there was evidence and proof that y'all couldn't do anything." \u000aWatch the full exchange below.

VEdgar Mitchell was the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 14\u000aAliens have contacted humans several times but governments have hidden the truth for 60 years, the sixth man to walk on the moon has claimed.\u000aApollo 14 astronaut Dr Edgar Mitchell, said he was aware of many UFO visits to Earth during his career with NASA but each one was covered up.\u000aDr Mitchell, 77, said during a radio interview that sources at the space agency who had had contact with aliens described the beings as 'little people who look strange to us.'\u000aHe said supposedly real-life ET's were similar to the traditional image of a small frame, large eyes and head.\u000aChillingly, he claimed our technology is 'not nearly as sophisticated' as theirs and "had they been hostile", he warned 'we would be been gone by now'.\u000aDr Mitchell, along with with Apollo 14 commander Alan Shepard, holds the record for the longest ever moon walk, at nine hours and 17 minutes following their 1971 mission.\u000a'I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we've been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomena is real,' Dr Mitchell said.\u000a 'It's been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so, but slowly it's leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it.\u000aUFO theorists believe Roswell in New Mexico was the site of an alien crash in 1947\u000a'I've been in military and intelligence circles, who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge, yes - we have been visited. Reading the papers recently, it's been happening quite a bit.'\u000aDr Mitchell, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a Doctor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics claimed Roswell was real and similar alien visits continue to be investigated.\u000aHe told the astonished Kerrang! radio host Nick Margerrison: "This is really starting to open up. I think we're headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction.' \u000aMr Margerrison said: 'I thought I'd stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and there's no debating it.'\u000a Officials from NASA, however, were quick to play the comments down.\u000aIn a statement, a spokesman said: "NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe.\u000a'Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.'

VThe Associated Press \u000aNEW YORK  A secret child is usually the stuff of soap operas and romance novels  which makes it a perfect fit for the Jackson family.\u000aJanet Jacksons former brother-in-law set off a deluge of water cooler chatter when he claimed the singer has an 18-year-old daughter, Renee, with her first husband, James DeBarge.\u000aYoung DeBarge, a 28-year-old aspiring singer, said Renee has been living with Rebbie Jackson, Janets oldest sister, and that James and the Jackson family kept everything real close, real tight.\u000aJanet Jacksons spokespeople didnt return calls for comment Monday or Tuesday. The whereabouts of Rebbie Jackson and James DeBarge were unknown.\u000aJanet and James were married for three months in 1984. Simple math means an 18-year-old daughter would have been born about 1987, shortly after Jackson released her breakthrough album, Control.\u000aYoung DeBarges claim was no surprise to Jackson fans, who have long spoken of a secret child from her tumultuous marriage to DeBarge, a singer in the family R\u005cu0026B group DeBarge.\u000aNot surprisingly, its difficult for celebrities to keep secrets. The last such bombshell might be the 2003 disclosure that longtime U.S. senator and former segregationist Strom Thurmond had a black daughter.\u000aIn 2000, it was revealed that Jesse Jackson had a year-old daughter with a young staffer. And earlier this year, a former flight attendant said Prince Albert of Monaco was the father of her 2-year-old son.\u000aA closer parallel to the Janet Jackson-James DeBarge accusation might be Loretta Young and Clark Gable, whose daughter was born after their brief fling in 1935. Young, who wasnt married at the time, kept her pregnancy a secret. The baby was placed in an orphanage and later adopted by the actress, though no adoption papers were filed.\u000aWhile many cases suggest its the fathers reputation thats being protected, the gender lines seem to be switched in the Janet Jackson story, where shielding Jacksons (not the fathers) reputation is the apparent motive for concealment.\u000aIn the acclaimed 2003 documentary My Architect, Nathaniel Kahn told of the secret life of his father, world-renowned architect Louis Kahn. In it, the filmmaker examines why his father kept him and his mother (as well as another child and mother) a secret for his entire life.\u000aWhether Renee would make that public step remains to be seen. At 18, its (legally) her destiny  and Young DeBarge did say, Shes a wonderful singer.

VFamous Relationships \u000aEver since the news that her former husband Brad Pitt and his second wife Angelina Jolie were divorcing, Jennifer Aniston has been faced with rumors about everything from her views on their divorce (did she really proclaim that it was karma?) to speculation that she would reunite with Pitt (despite the fact that shes currently married to Justin Theroux). Now Aniston has dropped a bombshell, revealing her 1 feelings about how she felt when she and Brad split as well as how she feels about all those endless tabloid stories on subjects such as her childless status. Jennifer is opening up amid allegations that Theroux has issued a warning to Pitt.\u000aJennifer Aniston talks being shamed for her divorce from Brad Pitt and why Justin Theroux is the right guy for her. https://t.co/eTlxFJV04B pic.twitter.com/OYYJEGnSb3\u000a EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) November 7, 2016\u000aAniston revealed that she feels she was shamed for her divorce from Brad, reported ET.\u000aAnd that shaming isnt limited to the aftermath of that breakup from Pitt. Jennifer is now admitting that she feels her romantic relationships were shamed during her entire career as an actress.\u000aJennifer Aniston feels she was shamed after her divorce from Brad Pitt. [Image by Chris Pizzello/AP Images]\u000aIn addition to denouncing those who attempted to shame her when she was single after her divorce from Brad, the 47-year-old Friends actress is taking a stance against those who tried to pass judgment on her for being childless, as well as body-shaming. Jennifer opened up about those concerns in a recent interview with Marie Claire.\u000aMy marital status has been shamed; my divorce status was shamed; my lack of a mate had been shamed; my nipples have been shamed.\u000aTo those who still feel tempted to pick apart Aniston in terms of her body or her choices when it comes to having children, Jennifer questions why women are viewed only through this particular lens of picking us apart. Moreover, she demanded to know why society focused on those elements.\u000aI have worked too hard in this life and this career to be whittled down to a sad, childless human.\u000aIn addition to attacking the various types of shaming that she has experienced, Aniston was candid in disclosing how she feels about Justin.\u000aJennifer Aniston refuses to "be whittled down to a sad, childless human": https://t.co/Z3iQtabhEL pic.twitter.com/uYgvsibz7I\u000a E! News (@enews) November 7, 2016\u000aJennifer is just as vocal about how much she appreciates Justin as she is about her frustration in being shamed, and Aniston emphasized that she truly cares about her husband, reported E News.\u000aAll I know is that I feel completely seen, and adored, in no matter what state, gushed Jennifer. And it brings forth the best part of myself, because I care about him so much.\u000aJennifer Aniston shares her love for Justin Theroux. [Image by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Images]\u000aCalling Theroux a good person, Aniston shared that both spouses have refused roles so that they can be closer. In order to take a role, she needs to be madly in love with the opportunity, explained Jennifer. And its not always easy to find those roles that are worth it, she added.\u000aThis is a time when Im not completely sure what Im doing. Im at this sort of crossroads.\u000aThe actress is exploring what inspires her, she explained,and is searching for something that makes my heart sing, describing that as the most challenging aspect of her life.\u000aWhile Aniston takes on that challenge, Theroux allegedly has issued a different sort of challenge in the form of a warning to Jennifers ex husband Brad Pitt.\u000aJustin Theroux Did NOT Warn Brad Pitt To Stay Away From Jennifer Aniston, Despite Report https://t.co/ntPOC642mK\u000a Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) November 6, 2016\u000aJustin reportedly issued a warningto Brad to stay away from Jennifer, claimed Celeb Dirty Laundry via Gossip Cop, which checked out the allegation.\u000aReferring to Therouxs Instagram photo that included a wall with a sentence F*ck Brad Pitt, the report claimed the photo was Justins way of telling Brad to back off from his wife. The story also alleged that Theroux and Aniston got into a nasty fight over her possibly communicating with Brad Pitt again, describing Justin as infuriated with knowing that his wife might possibly be in love with her ex-husband.\u000aHowever, Gossip Cop pointed out that the wall contained a variety of phrases, and after numerous reports claiming that Theroux had been throwing shade at Pitt, Justin even headed back to Instagram to emphasize that he was not shading anyone.\u000aAs for the allegation that Jennifer and Justin were fighting, Gossip Cop reported that she is not in touch with Brad and no nasty fight occurred, nor did Theroux try to warn Pitt.

VThe outlook for Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) fourth-quarter earnings isn't very good. Management's guidance for the quarter indicates that investors will probably see a decline in operating income year over year. Management expects $0 to $1.25 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter, compared with $1.1 billion last year.\u000aAmazon's revenue guidance of $42 billion to $45.5 billion is largely in line with analysts' expectations, but the operating margins are much lower than expected. Amazon exhibited a similar performance with its third-quarter results, meeting revenue expectations but falling well short on earnings results.\u000aThe fourth quarter is typically Amazon's most profitable of the year. Should investors panic that margin is taking a hit?\u000aBuilding out the fulfillment network\u000aAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told analysts in the company's second-quarter earnings call that it would ramp up its fulfillment network openings. And that's exactly what happened.\u000aAmazon opened 18 new fulfillment centers in the third quarter. It has already opened five more in the fourth quarter. That ought to complete its fulfillment center build-out for the year, which Olsavsky noted is 26 new centers -- an increase from 14 last year.\u000aBut even with the buildout complete for the year, Amazon still faces costs with getting those fulfillment centers online and running at full capacity. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Olsavsky noted, "There will be a cycle where those [fulfillment centers] will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017."\u000aThese fulfillment centers are imperative to Amazon's operations. In the fourth quarter last year, it faced capacity issues, which led to higher fulfillment costs. Fulfillment costs have continued to climb through 2016 as it brings more fulfillment centers online.\u000aA growing percentage of its sales is coming from its Fulfilled by Amazon program, which requires more warehouse space. Additionally, Prime membership continues to grow, which requires more fulfillment centers to guarantee two-day shipping. As more fulfillment centers move to full capacity over the next couple of years, fulfillment costs as a percentage of revenue ought to decline.\u000aContinued investment in Prime Video\u000aThe other major area of investment is in Prime Instant Video. Olsavsky told analysts that Amazon is doubling its content budget for the second half of 2016. It's tripling the number of originals on Prime compared with last year.\u000aPrime continues to grow rapidly, and video is one of its best onboarding tools. When Prime trial members use video, Amazon sees higher retention rates, and it sees higher renewal rates from full Prime members who use video.\u000aOriginals can be some of the most cost-effective content for a streaming service, but they're extremely front-loaded. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) found originals to be some of the most efficient content on its platform. What's more, originals are an effective tool to reduce churn, as they allow for something new every month.\u000aInvesting in video is a key way to grow Prime memberships, which is one of the three pillars of Amazon's business. Of course, that Prime membership growth needs to be supported by more fulfillment centers, which has caused an increase in the amount Amazon is spending. All of this goes to support future revenue growth. As long as revenue growth remains on track -- and it is -- there's not much to be worried about with Amazon's margins.

VDonald Trump (Photo Credit: Twitter/@realdonaldtrump\u000aDonald Trump will be the next President of the United States of America. In an election that stunned the nation, a man who embraces bigotry and racism will lead the country for the next four years. The reality of a Trump presidency is frightening on every level.\u000aMillions of Americans sided with the most unfit presidential candidate in history because he spoke their language. Hate and divisiveness lives in America, but that doesnt mean that we die. Black Americans have always survived.\u000aOur ancestors endured 400 years of slavery where we were considered three-fifths of a human. Post-slavery, the United States government created Black Codes which led to Blacks being arrested and jailed for small crimes such as vagrancy. At the same time, the rise of the KKK led to Black murders and lynchings that often remained unsolved. Jim Crow laws in the South made it illegal for Blacks to attend certain schools, eat at certain restaurants, and even sit next to a White person on a bus. Blacks faced intimidation and restrictive voting laws until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Black people found life after Reaganomics, high poverty rates, the crack-cocaine era, and mass incarceration.\u000aThe Trump Presidential administration will likely present another major challenge for Black America. But the best way to endure a crisis is to fight harder than before. Black people must fight harder to make education a priority for our kids; we must fight harder to ensure that we come together to give college students the finances to achieve; we must work harder to build and support Black businesses; we must come together to bring crime down in our communities by training and creating more jobs for those who lack skills.\u000aPolicies in healthcare and education will be affected by Trump, but Blacks have always had to solve the issues facing Black America. With Trump in office, this will continue. Weve been here before. As a result, Blacks will survive the Trump administration and beyond.

VThough President Barack Obama is set to leave office in matter of months, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is not willing to let him go without a full explanation as to why his administration refused to jail the Wall Street banksters behind the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\u000aIn a letter sent to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz on Thursday, the progressive firebrand demanded an investigation into why the DOJ refused to file criminal charges against individuals despite serious indications of violation[s] of federal securities and other laws, uncovered by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) probe into the causes of the economic crash.\u000aWarren said her staff reviewed thousands of documents recently made public by the FCIC, and identified 11 separate FCIC referrals of individuals or corporations to DOJ in cases where the FCIC found such evidence. According to Warren, Nine individuals were implicated in these referrals (two were implicated twice).\u000aThe DOJ, she continued, has not filed any criminal prosecutions against any of the nine individuals. Not one of the nine has gone to prison or been convicted of a criminal offense. Not a single one has even been indicted or brought to trial.\u000aFurther, she notes that her staff review identified potentially illegal activity at 14 corporations (including five that were implicated in multiple referrals). Though there were five corporations that reached a settlement with the DOJ, not one was criminally indicted or brought to trial.\u000aSummarizing the letter, financial reporter David Dayen noted that the corporate criminals examined in the FCIC documents included:\u000a ... most of Americas largest banksCitigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America)along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Socit Generale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moodys, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u000aThe FCIC presented DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave 0 representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law. \u000aAnd the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae, CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG, CEO Stan ONeal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch, and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup.\u000aThe DOJs failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable, Warren concludes. This failure requires an explanations.\u000aThursday also marks eight years since Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Warren said the anniversary is a good occasion to stop and ask where the real accountability is and get some answers out of the Justice Department about why they havent prosecuted anyone.\u000aOn social media, Warren reiterated that point:\u000a8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy \u005cu0026 millions of people suffered for it.\u000a Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 15, 2016\u000aWarren also wrote to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), on Thursday asking for his department to release any and all materials related to the FBIs investigations and prosecutorial decisions regarding the FCIC referrals, noting that the additional information may help in the examination of this failure.\u000aIn the Comey letter, Warren acknowledges that the FBI does not typically release internal documents from its investigations, but that the bureau under Comey recently set new precedent for doing so with its disclosure of information pertaining to the investigation of presidential nominee Hillary Clintons email server.\u000aAt the time, Comey said that making these materials available to the public [was] in the interest of transparency.\u000aThese new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals, Warren writes. If Secretary Clintons email server was of sufficient interest to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then sure the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency.\u000aShe concludes: For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of intense public interest about which the American people deserve the details than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.\u000aIf you have trouble leaving a comment, review this help page.

VNames used to refer to the "black" community have changed, and continue to change. I sometimes say I was born a colored boy, then I became a Negro, then black, then African-American, and still we are not done. To the list of identities black people in America have assumed or been asked to, we can now add, thanks to this presidential election season, "Obama's people" and "The African Americans."\u000aMany of these names were imposed on us, but not all. For a people to be whole, they must participate in their naming. After being called blacks in a derogatory manner by the white community for years, we reclaimed that term and began referring to ourselves as black, in an effort to embrace and define ourselves. Malcolm X became widely known as one of the first black public figures, while Justice Thurgood Marshall insisted on being called a negro until shortly before he died.\u000aDuring most of these name changes, I didn't understand how relational and situational these processes were. But they were, and still are. It matters not only what we call ourselves, but what others call us. These are not just labels; they indicate different social positions. As such, they not only situate and affect blacks, but also whites. This dance is relational even if it is not symmetrical.\u000aWhen Donald Trump refers to "the African Americans," his use of the word "the" attempts to put black Americans into one monolithic category. The "the" becomes a code, a signal that he distances himself from an entire group. He is reassuring his supporters that "the" group he is referring to is the Other. During one debate, Trump declared his commitment to be a president who would serve all people he responded in part like this: "African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what's happening to our inner cities."\u000aTrump's characterization of black people and black neighborhoods is the worst, and most racist, stereotype that exists, because it signifies that black space and black people are separate and to be feared. His stereotyping distorts the complexity and reality of black life in America. It also asserts that this imagined black space is far from normal--normal being defined as white space--and can only be fixed by law and order.\u000aBlacks do not comprise one bloc of people. Our community is diverse. Most blacks do not live in the city, or the inner city. Most blacks in America are not poor.\u000aBut from "welfare queen" to "inner city" to "The African Americans" the list of both coded and explicit characterizations of what is a multifaceted community grows. Yes, there are real issues facing black Americans, just like any community, but they are not all bad, and they are not all the same. Far too many African Americans are in jail, but not all are. Far too many black Americans fear getting shot by police, but not all do.\u000aFor Trump there is little to no relationship between the black space and the white space that most of his supporters inhabit. Trump's strategy and use of language is designed to further stigmatize the black community to a largely white base. The kind of extreme stereotypes Trump projects publicly about black people are in the same vein as ones he communicates about other groups, including Mexicans, Muslims, and women. They are the most crass and simplistic projections. In Trump's worldview, black communities are gang-plagued ghettos, all Muslims are radical terrorists, the entire country of Mexico is an organized crime cartel, and women are liars and nasty people whose worth is due to their physical appearance and usefulness to men. As over the top and absurd as these characterizations sound and are, what matters is the frequency of and consistency at which these stereotypes are communicated, and that Trump's demagoguery is constantly amplified on prominent, national media platforms.\u000aLanguage has always been a way to divide, conquer, classify, and control, but it also helps to constitute who we are and what we think. Language matters, as the stories we live help to give facts and reality their meaning. It is hard to sway minds that have already made unconscious connections.\u000aLanguage matters because when used as rhetoric it can have a purposeful smoke-and-mirrors effect, shielding more pressing issues that need our attention. As Trump warns that millions of immigrants and blacks are likely to steal the election, we remember that the history of fraud in the US elections has not been about black and brown people voting, but about Republican governors making it more difficult to vote. I worry that Trump may be suggesting that the very civic participation of blacks and other Others may be experienced itself as a kind of loss, as a kind of theft.\u000aI don't know what we will call ourselves in the coming years, given the growing diversity in the black community, largely due to immigration from Africa and the Caribbean. While I cannot say what we will settle on, I can say it will not be a singular term such as "The Blacks" or "The African Americans." Instead, I hope it will be a name that reflects our diversity as well as our deep and changing relationships. I hope our evolving name helps us claim ourselves in deep relationship with those who might think of us as Other. Our name will not only name, it will help us claim ourselves with full dignity and our belonging with all other members of The Earth.

VQuickhoney for Reader's Digest\u000aScientific efforts to develop a new eating plan to substantially reduce Alzheimers risk may be working. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago developed the MIND diet over a two-year period. They took elements of two proven heart-healthy regimensthe Mediterranean diet and the blood-pressure-slashing DASH diet (aka Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). Then they consulted the latest human and animal nutrition studies and tailored a combo designed to boost brain health. (MIND is short for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) Finally they tested the eating plan on 960 volunteers over four and a half years. The MIND diet reduced Alzheimers risk by 53 percent among those who followed the plan strictly and by 35 percent for those who followed it moderately well, according to research published in Alzheimers \u005cu0026 Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimers Association.\u000aThe brain-boosting benefits come down to two general principles: Limit foods that are high in saturated fats and calories but have low nutritional value, and eat more foods that offer nutrients that help your brain, says Martha Clare Morris, the plans chief creator and the director of nutrition and nutritional epidemiology at Rush. The top nutrients are vitamin E; B vitamins; omega-3s; some of the carotenoids, lutein in particular; and flavonoids, she explains.\u000aHere are the 10 foods to eat and five foods to limit every week, which make up the core of the MIND diet.\u000aDo Eat \u000a ? Six or more servings of leafy-green vegetables every week. (Thats almost a salad a day.)\u000a ? At least one serving of another vegetable every day.\u000a ? More than two servings of berries every week.\u000a ? More than five servings of nuts every week. (Try them as a daily snack.)\u000a ? Extra-virgin olive oil instead of butter and as your primary cooking oil.\u000a ? More than three servings of whole grains every day.\u000a ? Fish that hasnt been fried for at least one meal every week.\u000a ? Beans for more than three meals every week (that is, eat beans roughly every other day).\u000a ? Poultry for more than two meals every week.\u000a ? A glass of wine every day (though Morris says theres no need to drink this if youre avoiding alcohol).\u000a Do Limit \u000a ? Butter to one tablespoon every day.\u000a ? Cheese to less than one serving every week.\u000a ? Red meat to fewer than four meals every week.\u000a ? Fried foods and fast food to less than one serving every week.\u000a ? Sweets and pastries to fewer than five servings every week.

VI wear several different hats; in one, I practice an aggressive brand of preventive cardiology and heart disease reversal. In another role, I serve as an impartial medical expert, reviewing records from other doctors and hospitals where patients have experienced bad outcomes, often death.\u000aSounds fun, I know!\u000aJust this week, I reviewed a file of a 50-year-old male smoker who went to the emergency room with two days of chest pain. He had minimal testing, and was released in an hour with instructions to see his family doctor in a week. Sadly, he died of a heart attack three days later.\u000aThis is all too common. While not all deaths can be foreseen and prevented, I've created a list of questions to ask and tests to request from your healthcare providers, whether during routine office visits or trips to the ER with chest pain. Hopefully this will prepare you for dealing with an overtaxed medical system and protect you from heart damage.\u000a Ask for a coronary artery calcium scan (CACS) \u000aA CACS is by far the most accurate way to determine if your heart arteries are silently suffering. The heart gives no warnings until the arteries are badly blocked, and the first symptom you have may be the day you die. In my community, this widely available CT scan costs $80, uses no dye, and takes one minute. It's far more accurate for screening your heart than a stress test. Your score should be zero, and anything higher should prompt you to see a preventive cardiology expert.\u000a Never leave an ER without a complete evaluation \u000aFor starters, don't go to an urgent care clinic with chest pain, pressure, tightness, squeezing, or compression. Go to an emergency room.\u000aThat said, ERs have pressure on them to turn over rooms. I've reviewed charts from dozens of young people sent home with cursory evaluations, only to die or be maimed by massive heart attacks within days.\u000aBottom line: DON'T GO HOME without a thorough evaluation. Second, ask for "serial" cardiac enzymes that are repeated two or three times, every four to six hours. Third, ask for a repeat ECG to compare to the one you got initially.\u000aFinally, ask for a definitive test before discharge. This may be a treadmill stress test with echocardiography (no radiation) or nuclear imaging (radiation). In some ERs, the CACS or the advanced coronary CT angiogram may be available. If you're not severely allergic to iodine dye, this is by far the most accurate way to be sure your arteries are clean. If they aren't clean, a cardiologist will have to evaluate your status, but you'll know the score and -- most importantly -- be alive.\u000a Ask for advanced labs \u000aI've had 30-plus years of training and practice, so I can tell you that you'll probably have the same lab tests at an annual physical now as you would've in the 1970s. This isn't just outdated, it's unacceptable -- there have been major advances in laboratory testing in the past 40 years, believe it or not. I suggest asking for the following tests:\u000aAdvanced lipid profile: Rather than giving you an LDL cholesterol level, advanced panels measure LDL particle number and size, which are more predictive of future heart and stroke events. Two people with the same cholesterol levels can have widely different particle and size measurements, making for very different risks.\u000aLipoprotein a: This is a genetic form of cholesterol that's elevated in about 20% of those tested. It's rarely drawn, even though hundreds of research studies indicate that if it's high, the risk of heart attack and stroke skyrocket. There's even a foundation dedicated to educating the public of the risk.\u000aHomocysteine: This amino acid is produced by a process called methylation. It's important for artery and brain health, and when elevated, it may be due to a genetic defect in the MTHFR gene, which is also easily measured. It can be treated with methylated B complex vitamins, and the level will return to normal.\u000aInflammatory markers: The best known is hs-CRP, but there are at least five others I measure in my practice, like MPO. If there are markers of inflammation in the blood, a hunt is on for insulin resistance, infections, food allergies, skin conditions like psoriasis, a diet rich in processed foods, central obesity, gingivitis, and sleep apnea... among others. Inflammation can be reduced by addressing these root causes.\u000aTMAO: This is a newly described marker of heart and kidney health that's elevated after eating meat- and egg-heavy diets with an altered gut microbiome. It has been shown to cause heart and kidney damage, and is associated with worsened prognosis -- if you have high levels of this, you may want to make a transition to a more plant-based diet.\u000aYears ago, a routine physical included an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) but it's often skipped now. I suggest it for one particular reason: the measurement called the QT interval, which is the time between two waves in your heartbeat. A segment of the population has a genetic defect that causes the QT interval to be prolonged, and some people are prescribed drugs that prolong the QT interval.\u000aA long QT can result in death from a cardiac arrhythmia, and a number of medications have been pulled off the market due to this side effect. Knowing if you have a prolonged QT interval before you're prescribed antibiotics, antidepressants, and other medications is key.\u000a Get a vascular screening \u000aMany hospitals offer a vascular-screening program using ultrasounds of the carotid arteries, abdominal aorta, and legs. While they're rarely definitive, they can offer a good value if you're a smoker or have a family history of early heart disease or stroke. Arteries should have no plaque, so the presence of "mild" plaque should prompt you to have a complete evaluation by a vascular expert.\u000a Be wary of drug interactions \u000aThere are so many potential drug interactions and some of them are deadly. Some of them center on the long-QT syndrome found on your ECG mentioned above. There are online resources to check your list of medications for interactions, particularly if you are prescribed a new medication. Antibiotics are particularly frequent causes of drug interactions that can be avoided with proper research online.\u000aWhile I favor natural medicine and therapies emphasizing healthy lifestyle choices, there are genetic and acquired health issues that can be identified and addressed with proper evaluations. Heart issues are the focus of my quarter century of practice, but these lessons are 1 of other conditions (e.g., a bad headache not fully evaluated in the ER).\u000aDon't be afraid to challenge, ask why, read, and refuse to go home before proper testing is performed. My hope is that I'm never sent a medical chart to review with your name on it.\u000a Other Stuff You'll Like \u000a Clickbait

VThe states second highest court has upheld the convictions of four people in Genesee County, including a man serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting a child.\u000aTerrel A. Goodson was one of four defendants who had cases decided by the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, which issued its rulings Friday.\u000aGoodson was sentenced May 15, 2014 to 15 years to life in prison after a jury found him guilty of predatory sexual assault against a child. Goodson was convicted of raping a 10-year-old girl who was spending the night at Goodsons girlfriends apartment on Hutchins Street in 2013.\u000aGoodson appealed the verdict, claiming that the evidence was not sufficient enough to prove him guilty. Goodsons appeals lawyers argued that the victim and victims mother were not credible witnesses and that there was a lack of forensic evidence linking him to the crime.\u000aThe court unanimously ruled against Goodson, saying the weight of evidence was enough to convict him.\u000aGoodson also claimed he was deprived a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient representation by his defense attorney.\u000aBoth claims were unanimously dismissed.\u000aGoodson, who lived in Holley at the time of his arrest, is serving his term at Great Meadow Correctional Facility. He is eligible for parole in 2028.\u000aThe Appellate Division ruled on three other cases:\u000a- Jon J. Magliocco was already a registered sex offender when he was convicted of having a sexual relationship with a girl under 17 in 2014. Magliocco, 38, of Batavia was sentenced to two years in prison, was released but violated parole and was returned to serve out the remainder of his term.\u000aMagliocco appealed his conviction, even though he waived a jury trial and pleaded guilty. The court ruled against him, saying his plea was done voluntarily and that he had no right to appeal the severity of his sentence.\u000aMagliocco is scheduled to be released in January from Midstate Correctional.\u000a- A woman who fled the state rather than be sentenced for driving drunk with two toddlers in the car had her conviction upheld.\u000aNichole M. McKerrow was arrested in 2012 after police found her passed out in her car with two children inside. She was convicted of aggravated DWI but fled New York and went to Georgia to avoid sentencing. She was later arrested and returned to New York and sentenced to one to three years in state prison. She was released in August 2015 but remains on parole until September.\u000a- The court upheld the convictions of a Batavia man who had 75 charges against him in 2013 and 2014.\u000aBrian L. Smith, 54, is serving a two-to-eight year prison term for repeatedly stalking and harassing his ex-girlfriend in 2013 and 2014. Smith had been given a plea deal to avoid state prison but violated a court order of protection immediately after the plea deal and before he was supposed to be sentenced to jail. He also tried to smuggle drugs into jail. The judge instead imposed a state prison term.\u000aSmith appealed, claiming he was given to chance to withdraw his guilty pleas and was denied effective counsel.\u000aThe court unanimously upheld the conviction and sentence.\u000aSmith is in Midstate and is eligible for parole in September.

VLike many proud parents in the age of social media, Danica likes sharing photos of her adorable daughter on her Facebook page. \u000aBut Danica is aware of the digital dangers, and since she was putting her daughter out there, she made sure to set her profile to its private setting. \u000aWhat Danica didnt realize was that while her profile was private, her posts were still made public. \u000aIn 2015, one of Danicas Facebook friends noticed at least five photos of her four-year-old daughter, Bryleigh, on a complete strangers profile. Whoever it was had stolen and reposted Bryleighs pictures without Danicas consent. \u000aBut things were about to take an even creepier turn. The stranger, who was listed under the name Ramon Figueroa, claimed that Bryleigh was his daughter! The photos included captions like, Yall cant say ma daughter not ma twin, and, This is how she looks in the morning she said daddy stop [taking pictures]. \u000aDanica was horrified. Frantically, she sent Figueroa a message and asked him to remove the photos of Bryleigh  but he quickly blocked her from any further communication. \u000aThe enraged mother reported the photos to Facebook, and so did 40 of her friends who banded together in Bryleighs defense.\u000aScroll down to see what happened next, and please SHARE this scary story with your friends on Facebook!

She also had acromegaly, a condition that makes the bones of the head particularly large\u000a THE MEDIEVAL GIANTESS \u000aThe most notable thing about the woman is her staggering height of 7 feet 2 inches (215.5 centimetres).\u000aHer bones were normally proportioned, suggesting she suffered from gigantism C a condition caused by an over-production of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.\u000aShe also had acromegaly, a condition that makes the bones of the head particularly large.\u000aWith gigantism and acromegaly come a wealth of other health issues, which could be seen in the woman.\u000aHer spine showed evidence of degenerative joint disease, which was probably a result of her height and body weight.\u000aEvidence of a broken arm and leg at some point in her lifetime could also be seen, as a result of weak bones.\u000aSmall nodes on her ribs also suggest that she suffered from pleurisy, a lung inflammation condition.\u000aThe skeleton, estimated to date to between the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 14thcentury, was first discovered in 1977.\u000aBut details of the woman it belonged to have just been release in a new book, called 'New Developments in the Bioarchaeology of Care.'\u000aWhile all other burials in the cemetery were made with the head facing west, this woman's head was facing in the opposite direction.\u000aThe positioning of her body in the grave was also strange, with her right arm and left bent, rather than fully extended. \u000aMagda Matczak, author of the book, wrote: 'The unusual burial orientation, disposal of the body without care, and lack of grave goods may indicate that this woman belonged to a lower social stratum.'\u000aBut the most notable thing about the woman is her staggering height of 7 feet 2 inches (215.5 centimetres).\u000aHer bones were normally proportioned, suggesting she suffered from gigantism C a condition caused by an over-production of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.\u000aShe also had acromegaly, a condition that makes the bones of the head particularly large.\u000aWith gigantism and acromegaly come a wealth of other health issues, which could be seen in the woman.\u000aHer spine showed evidence of degenerative joint disease, which was probably a result of her height and body weight.\u000aEvidence of a broken arm and leg at some point in her lifetime could also be seen, as a result of weak bones.\u000aSmall nodes on her ribs also suggest that she suffered from pleurisy, a lung inflammation condition.\u000aWhile all other burials in the cemetery were made with the head facing west, this woman's head was found to be facing in the opposite direction. The positioning of her body in the grave was also strange, with her right arm and left bent, rather than fully extended\u000aThe mysterious skeleton was found just outside a church of the Ostrw Lednicki stronghold in Poland. Other strange finds at the cemetery include a person with dwarfism, and a woman with leprosy\u000a WHAT IS GIGANTISM?\u000aGigantism is a rare condition that causes abnormal growth. \u000aThis change is most notable in terms of height, but girth is affected as well. \u000aThis condition, which most often affects children, occurs due to a non-cancerous tumor on the pituitary gland that creates too much growth hormone. \u000aChildren with gigantism will grow unusually tall, and many will experience delayed puberty.\u000aDiagnosing gigantism can be difficult for parents, because the condition does not cause many signs other than unusual height. \u000aIf the family is an unusually tall family, this may simply be attributed to a growth spurt or the child's genetic makeup.\u000aOther conditions associated with gigantism and acromegaly include skin changes, psychiatric problems and diabetes, and while these could not be detected from her skeleton, the researchers believe there is a high chance she suffered with these.\u000a 'We know that it is hazardous to speculate about the emotional state of a past individual when we have only her bones to guide us,' Ms Matczak wrote.\u000a'However, based on modern clinical findings we feel justified in suggesting that the woman with gigantism may have felt any one, or more, of the following at different times, or even concurrently: irritability, anxiety, emotional liability, uncertainty, confusion, sadness, and anger.'\u000aBefore the 19th century, gigantism was not a well-known condition.\u000aSpeaking to Forbes, Francesco Galassi, a researcher at the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, said the find 'expands our limited knowledge of the evolution of the morphology of these two incapacitating and stigmatising conditions.'\u000aOther strange finds at the cemetery include a person with dwarfism, and a woman with leprosy.

VReprinted with permission from AlterNet. \u000aVery few pollsters predicted Donald Trump even clinching the nomination and it took months for some to accept his run as anything other than a publicity stunt. Still, when he did win the nomination, Trumps chances of becoming president never hovered above 30% according to Nate Silver, until approximately 8:30pm on election night.\u000aHowever, Washington, D.C.-based professor Allan Lichtman explained why Trump would win in September 2016.\u000aBased on the 13 keys, it would predict a Donald Trump victory, he told the Washington Post.\u000aLichtmans system of keys is detailed in his new book, Predicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House 2016. In short, it was the political climate surrounding President Obamas second term that laid fertile ground for an upset from the Republican side.\u000aWhile 90% of Republicans voted for Trump, Lichtman insisted that this marriage between establishment Republicans and Donald Trump is doomed.\u000aIm going to make another prediction, Lichtman said. This one is not based on a system; its just my gut. They dont want Trump as president, because they cant control him. Hes unpredictable.\u000aLichtman then explained what he believes the House is planning.\u000aTheyd love to have Pence  an absolutely down-the-line, conservative, controllable Republican. And Im quite certain Trump will give someone grounds for impeachment, either by doing something that endangers national security or because it helps his pocketbook.\u000aAnd hes not the only one making this prediction.\u000aAlexandra Rosenmann is an AlterNet associate editor.

VFILE - In this Oct. 24, 2016, file photo, Houston Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler (17) greets Denver Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian (13) after an NFL football game in Denver. Osweiler's 5-2 record as Denver's starter earned him a $72 million contract. Trevor Siemian went 6-1 in his first seven starts for the Broncos, and he got a tongue-lashing. Jack Dempsey, File\u000aBrock Osweiler's 5-2 record as Denver's starter earned him a $72 million contract in Houston. Trevor Siemian went 6-1 in his first seven starts for the Broncos, garnering both criticism and kudos.\u000aSiemian threw a pick-6 against San Diego last weekend, his first interception since Sept. 18, but the Broncos prevailed 27-19 largely because the Chargers dropped four other passes that went right to them.\u000aWhile acknowledging that Siemian's O-line didn't do him any favors and his ground game didn't help him much, coach Gary Kubiak called out his quarterback earlier this week, saying his decision-making needs to get better.\u000aOn Wednesday, Kubiak tallied the votes and announced after practice that Siemian's teammates had named him offensive co-captain.\u000a"That's pretty cool, to be such a young guy and in his first year of playing," Kubiak said. "It tells him that they want him to lead them, regardless of what year he's in. So, he needs to continue to do that and push forward and we've got to help him."\u000aSiemian joins seventh-year wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, the longest-tenured Bronco, as offensive co-captain.\u000a"It means a lot to me, to first of all be a part of this locker room, and then to know some guys think of me in that light," Siemian said. "So, it's a huge honor to me. I'm really excited to be a part of this thing."\u000aWhile Siemian is settling into an expanded leadership role, his play has flat-lined after a stellar first month as Peyton Manning's surprise successor. And the Broncos desperately need him to rediscover that mojo over a daunting second-half schedule that features a single home game in November (Chiefs), December (Patriots) and January (Raiders).\u000aSiemian, the 250th overall draft pick in 2015, out-dueled top overall picks Cam Newton, Andrew Luck and Jameis Winston in his first month, but he bruised his left shoulder against Tampa Bay and missed the second half.\u000aThe injury kept him out against Atlanta a week later. With rookie Paxton Lynch at quarterback, the Broncos lost to Atlanta. Four days later, a still sore Siemian was back under center and clearly compromised in Denver's loss at San Diego.\u000aSiemian looked much better 11 days later in a win over Houston and he won the rematch against the Chargers on Sunday  but he can thank his defense for hitting Philip Rivers 17 times, deflecting 13 of his passes and picking off three others.\u000aSiemian was 20 of 38 for 276 yards with no touchdowns, a pick-6, a strip-sack and a season-worst 65.2 QB rating.\u000a"I wasn't seeing things right," Siemian said.\u000aOpponents now have plenty of film to break down Siemian's strengths and shortcomings, tendencies and trends.\u000aUp next is Oakland in a renewed rivalry between 6-2 teams trying to keep up with the New England Patriots for supremacy in the AFC.\u000a"He's a good young quarterback and seems to have command of the offense and Kubes is not afraid to let him throw it," Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. "They're opening games throwing the ball a bunch, so I think he's been a nice  I don't know if you call it a pleasant surprise or not  they probably knew what they had, but obviously there was a lot of discussion of who was going to be their quarterback. And he's come in and done a nice job for them."\u000aThe Raiders proved to be the toughest team for both Manning and Osweiler last year when the Broncos were marching toward their Super Bowl title. Neither one found the end zone against Oakland.\u000aIn Week 5, the Broncos won 16-10 at Oakland when cornerback Chris Harris Jr. returned an interception 74 yards for Denver's only TD as Manning was picked off twice and sacked twice.\u000aIn Week 13, the Raiders rallied for a 15-12 win in Denver despite being held to 126 yards because the Broncos fumbled twice in the red zone and Osweiler was sacked five times by Khalil Mack.\u000a"You certainly have to be aware of where he's at," Siemian said of Mack. "And (Bruce) Irvin on the other edge is pretty good, too. So, we're going to have our hands full."\u000aNotes: CB Bradley Roby was named AFC defensive player of the week after recording seven tackles, two pass breakups and a pick-6 while starting for Aqib Talib (back). The honor comes a week after he was named the NFLPA community MVP for his efforts to empower kids through academic and social outreach programs.\u000a---\u000aAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP-NFL

VBreakups sometimes necessitate a few days of sweatpants and a pint or two of Ben \u005cu0026 Jerrys. But proving yet again that stars are not, in fact, just like us, Bella Hadid (who is rumored to have called it quits with The Weeknd) was out and about in Los Angeles yesterday, carrying on in 1 Hadid-sister fashion: by setting a new trend. \u000aSlip dresses have been all the rage for months now. But to add a fresh twist on the trend, the 20-year-old model cinched her silky nude number with a black belt. The effect: a bit badass and a welcome tweak on the now-ubiquitous throwback garment. It's a simple, easy-to-copy styling trick that has a lot of impact. \u000aHadid finished off the look with several other of-the-moment trends. Taking a cue from Demna-era Balenciaga, Hadid wore her distressed denim jacket off the shoulders, which we've found to be quite difficult to do IRL, so props to her. She also opted for a Gigi-approved monochromatic look, sporting matching laceless nude sneakers with black detailing. And for further proof that Hadid may have, in fact, begun to move on, look no further than her necklace, which spells out her own name, instead of reading "Abel."

VBILL WECHTER via Getty Images\u000aTo my friends (yes, friends) who voted for Trump: \u000aYou say you voted for Trump for reasons entirely absent from hatred, racism, and misogyny. You are sick of being called a racist, a misanthrope, a sexist, a xenophobe.\u000aSo let's start with this premise: I believe you when you say you don't hold any of these things in your heart. I believe you when you say that these things are not why you voted for him. I BELIEVE YOU.\u000aBut/and: he and his surrogates do say hateful things, and use coded language like "certain groups" and "certain neighborhoods." Some people are hearing those things and are now feeling emboldened to do and say truly hateful, un-American things to minority groups. The stories are pouring in: American women having their hijabs ripped from their heads, women being grabbed as men laugh and say "we can grab you by the pussy now," brown schoolchildren coming home in tears because some of their white classmates have told them they'll have to leave the country, Black people being called n*** in the street by white people who say, "God, it feels so good to say that in public again."\u000aBut you are not doing those things, and you wouldn't. I know that that is not YOU. Hear me say it. Stop thinking I am saying this at you, when I am just saying it to you. I believe you, so please believe me.\u000aYour knee-jerk reaction is going to be to shout, "Those bad apples don't represent me, so don't lay their horrible behavior at my feet!" How many ways can I say this? I believe you. But/and this is still a real phenomenon. You and those apples supported, and support, the same man, even if for vastly different reasons. And those bad apples feel really, really good right now. The KKK is holding a celebratory parade. A PARADE. Those awful people?--?who I rush to say, again and again, are not you?--?feel vindicated and empowered by this election result.\u000aSo here's where I stand: You voted for him, so I believe you have a responsibility to hold him to a truly American standard.\u000aI'm not asking you to reject the president-elect.\u000aI'm not asking you to apologize for your vote.\u000aI'm not telling you you're not allowed to feel vindicated for your feelings of being ignored and left out and lied to.\u000aI'm not telling you what your stance on immigration or refugees or Black Lives Matter should be.\u000aHere's what I am saying: You've said all along that you disagree with the 'inelegant' things Trump says about all kinds of groups of people. You've agreed that his statements about women are abhorrent. You say you like him because he gets stuff done, not because of the way he speaks. And I believe to my core that you agree that all people should be treated with decency.\u000aSo, now you get to prove it. It's actually so simple: Demand that it end. Demand that he finally, vociferously reject the KKK and other white supremacist groups. Every single time he or his surrogates says something over-generalized about any group of people?--?"all Black people live in inner cities and their lives are hell"; "all/most/many refugees/immigrants/Muslims/whatever are dangerous"; "that woman is only a 7"? -- hold him to the highest standard you have. Contact him and tell him, "I support you, I voted for you, and I demand that you stop saying these things."\u000aNow is a real chance to prove everyone wrong. It's also a real chance to actually protect some fellow Americans and fellow humans from harm. How?\u000aYou, a good-hearted, well-intentioned, America-loving person, can publicly and loudly demand that the president-elect and all of his surrogates and appointees denounce all hate groups who are celebrating this win as a win for their agenda. You can demand?--?publicly, not just on your Facebook feed or just to friends?--?that the president-elect make a public statement disavowing and condemning every single act of violence, intimidation, bigotry, misogyny, and hatred that is being done in his name and in the name of his movement. He should just say it: "This is disgusting, it's un-American, and I will not allow it to be done in my name or in celebration of my Presidency."\u000aYou are the only ones who can do this.\u000aDo it because you are all the things you say you are: loving, tolerant, inclusive, and American.\u000aDo it because, as Edmund Burke said, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good (wo)men to do nothing."

VAh, sugar. The thing that makes literally anything taste good. It's in everything you love and, most importantly, in everything you might make an effort to avoid. \u000aThe worst of the sugars is sucrose, the artificial, bad-for-you stuff that's added into foods and sweets to make them taste delicious. Not only is there a correlation between excessive sugar intake and health issues like diabetes and obesity, it is also purported that sugar is linked to bad skin, bad moods and low energy. The commonly believed reason for the latter two is that, once the addictive sugar high weans off, your energy and mood dips. Like with caffeine, but tastier and less obvious.\u000aI decided to take the plunge so you don't have to: cut out sugar for two whole weeks and see what kind of difference  if any  it would make. Even though I was eating quite a bit of sugary nonsense at the time, I went in pretty optimistic, thinking I could definitely tackle this.\u000aWhen I started out, my skin was misbehaving quite a bit, with little pimples appearing mainly in my hairline. I wondered whether my no-sugar diet would eliminate this. I also generally have issues with maintaining a steady level of energy throughout the day, so I thought that maybe cutting sugar out might leave my energy levels more even.\u000aFor the first couple of days, I was sort of OK. It was a little bit challenging, but not, like, the worst. The easiest thing to cut out was sugary drinks, because I became wise to that whole 500-spoons-of-sugar-in-one-glass-of-soda thing ages ago, so I mainly drink water or diet drinks (I know, I know  those aspartame-containing drinks aren't much healthier) and I never take sugar in my coffee or tea, anyway. \u000aVIDEO: Why We're Obsessed with David Kirsch's Diet Book\u000aAfter a few days, though, it was apparent that sugar is in everything, especially in things that are low-fat. It's in, like, every packaged food ever. I was having a bit of trouble avoiding sugar entirely and, sometimes, I'd already be eating something only to gander at the ingredients and realise I might as well have been drinking a Coke. \u000aThe only way to really avoid sugar, it seemed, was to eat only stuff at home, so I tried that.\u000aI didn't cut out natural sugars, like fructose, which is found in fruit. My goal here was to eliminate the processed, unnatural stuff, and I mostly succeeded, with a few tiny, unthinking slip-ups, mostly thanks to deceiving hidden sugars. Like, why is there sugar in a pasta salad? My bad.\u000aSo, here I am, two weeks out and, to be completely honest, I'd love to say that I'm a transformed person and my entire life has turned around, but it didn't make that much of a difference. Maybe I wasn't eating as much sugar as I thought I was?\u000aThe main benefit, I think, is that I somehow feel healthier. Like, on any given day, I don't feel bad about myself and what I've eaten, which sugary foods have the ability to make me feel. My stomach isn't bloated, mostly because I haven't been adding extra, sweet treats throughout the day.\u000aAs for my energy levels, I honestly feel almost exactly the same. I still experience fluctuations in energy throughout the day, with most of my energy uselessly coming to me at night. I've just always been this way; I don't think cutting out one type of food is going to change that, I guess.\u000aMy skin did improve a slight, slight bit, but really nothing that anybody else might notice. I think if I did this for long enough, though, I might see a noticeable difference. Plus, I'd probably need to cut out a whole lot of other foods, too, but baby steps, am I right?\u000aAll in all, I'd probably recommend trying this just to show yourself that you can, and the feeling of accomplishing something is pretty worth-it. It's also a useful first step to better eating; I like cutting one thing out at a time so that I'm not suddenly deprived of 65 different food options on any given day, making me less likely to have cravings and subsequently stop eating healthfully.\u000aSugar is really addictive and delicious, and it's somehow comforting to know that if I want to not eat it, I can.

Vkaley_cuoco_01 alien_artifact / Flickr CC\u000aHave we seen the last of Kaley Cuoco in The Big Bang Theory? Is season 10 the last for Penny because of a controversial BDSM scene?\u000aIt seems like the showrunners of The Big Bang Theory are bringing all the big guns for Season 10 to ensure that the show remains entertaining and fresh for fans.\u000aThat apparently includes a bold BDSM scene in the upcoming episodes, which has stirred up a fair bit of controversy already.\u000aKaley Cuoco recently shared a photo on Instagram of a behind-the-scenes look at the episode where both Penny and Leonard (Johnny Galecki) are dressed in BDSM Latex, reports The Huffington Post.\u000aWhile Galecki is sporting leather chaps and holding some sort of a whip, Cuoco is fitted with a body-hugging red corset dress and net stockings. Complete with a black leather choker, a police cap, and red lipstick, Kaley Cuoco is almost unrecognizable.\u000aEven though both Cuoco and Galecki seem more than comfortable with each other in the show, a scene that has heavy sexual connotations is bound to be difficult to shoot, seeing that both of them are former lovers.\u000aAlso, it may not be fun for Cuocos current boyfriend, Karl Cook, to watch his girlfriend enact such sexual scenes with the ex-love of her life.\u000aIt seems like Cook is presently out of town, since Kaley Cuoco recently posted a picture of them on Instagram with the caption Missing this sweet so much! Get back here, Mr! as reported by the International Business Times.\u000aWe wonder if the conversation regarding Cuoco agreeing to do such steamy scene with Galecki is going to be a heated one after Cook returns. Will he tell Cuoco to quit TBBT after Season 10?\u000aKaley Cuoco has hinted before that season 10 might be the last we see of Penny. But since none of the main cast members have renewed their contracts for next season, it is not yet clear if Cuoco actually meant that The Big Bang Theory Season 11 might be cancelled altogether.\u000a #bts of last nights @thebigbangtheory__ #kaleyspolaroids #corsettook15minstogeton @sanctionedjohnnygalecki\u000aA photo posted by @normancook on Nov 4, 2016 at 2:12pm PDT\u000a Missing this sweet ??so much!

VThe Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov passes within a few miles of Dover, in the southeast of England as a fleet of Russian warships sail through the North Sea, and the English Channel Friday October 21, 2016, on their way to the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Gareth Fuller/PA Wire)\u000aMOSCOW (AFP)  A flotilla of Russian warships is now in the eastern Mediterranean off the Syrian coast after being sent to reinforce Russias military in the area, a naval commander said on state television. \u000aThe commander of Russias flagship Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, Sergei Artamonov, said via videolink that the ships are now in the designated zone in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast. \u000aThe battle group has traveled to Syria from the North Sea through the English Channel in the biggest such naval deployment in recent years as part of Russias military intervention in Syria.\u000aRussia has been flying a bombing campaign in Syria for the past year in support of President Bashar Assad and has deployed a naval contingent to back up its operation.\u000aThe naval task force has been monitored closely by NATO, whose chief Jens Stoltenberg voiced concern the ships would be used to support the Russian military operation in Syria and increase human and civilian suffering.\u000aThe ships commander was speaking to a presenter on Russia-1 television from inside the Defense Ministry for a news show that will air this evening in Moscow.\u000aHe confirmed that aircraft are already taking off from the ships deck to view the conflict zone.\u000aFlights are being carried out from the deck they are working on coordination with the shore port, he said.\u000aThe flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days, he added.\u000aRussias Interfax news agency on Friday had cited a Russian military and diplomatic source as saying that Russian MiG and Sukhoi jets have been regularly flying into Syrian airspace from the Kuznetsov to determine combat missions.\u000aThe Russian television channel also spoke to the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, which is part of the same flotilla.\u000aAsked whether foreign aircraft were flying over the ships, the commander, Vladislav Malakhovsky, said they are afraid to come closer than 50 kilometers away, realizing very well how powerful the nuclear cruiser is.\u000aRussia says it has ceased strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo since October 18 and has also held brief unilateral ceasefires on the ground it calls humanitarian pauses.\u000aIt has accused the United States-led coalition of failing to persuade rebels to cooperate to allow civilians to leave, as only a few have done so.\u000aThe Russian defence ministry on Saturday said that it will introduce further humanitarian pauses only on condition that the United Nations humanitarian mission guarantees it is ready and able to organize aid supplies and evacuations.\u000aThe UN has warned that east Aleppo is now down to its final food supplies and has urged Russia to extend future truces to allow supplies through.\u000aRussia said Saturday it is ready to act at any time as long as the UN officially confirms its readiness and ability to supply humanitarian aid to Aleppo and evacuate wounded and sick peaceful residents.\u000aIt complained that previous assurances from the UN had turned out to be just words.\u000aVehicles carrying humanitarian aid that try to enter the designated humanitarian passages into the city have every time faced shooting from the rebel fighters and have been unable to drive through because of mined roads, the ministry said.\u000a Read more on: Moscow, Russia, Syria, Syrian civil war, Bashar Assad

VLeader of the banned northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, Sheikh Raed Salah center, in the Supreme Court in Jerusalem January 26, 2016. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\u000aThe jailed head of the banned Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement announced Sunday night that he will begin a hunger strike in protest at his prison conditions. \u000aSheikh Raed Salah, 58, an Israeli citizen from the northern city of Umm al-Fahm, began serving a nine month sentence in May. He was sentenced last year for incitement to violence and racism over an inflammatory sermon he delivered in 2007 in Jerusalem. He has previously served terms for similar offenses. \u000aSalah has been a key agitator on the Temple Mount, accusing Israel of seeking to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock shrine at the holy site.\u000aSalah is being held in the Ramon Prison in southern Israel. Prisons Service officials confirmed that Salah stated his intention to refuse food, but they say that so far he has not returned any of his meals uneaten, the Walla news site reported.\u000aAccording to Palestinian media, Salah began his strike to protest being held in solitary confinement. He is barred from any contact with other inmates.\u000aIn February, Salah went on a symbolic hunger strike in solidarity with Mohammed al-Qiq, a Palestinian prisoner being held by Israel under administrative detention. At the time, Salah told Al-Jazeera that former Knesset member Mohammad Barakeh was joining him in his protest.\u000aIn April, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Salah of stirring up trouble on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem ahead of the Jewish holiday of Passover that fell at the end of the month, and called for him to be jailed.\u000aIn the 2007 sermon that landed him in prison for incitement to terrorism, Salah expressed the hope that the streets of Jerusalem be purified with the blood of the innocent, who shed it in order to separate from their souls the soldiers of the Israel occupation, also in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque. He added that our finest moment will be when we meet Allah as martyrs in al-Aqsa.\u000aIsrael formally banned the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement on November 17, 2015, charging that the group had links to terrorist groups and was instrumental in inciting a wave of violence over the past year which has seen dozens of stabbing and shooting attacks by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs.\u000aThe North Branch rejects the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians and boycotts national elections on the grounds that they give legitimacy to the existence of the Jewish state.

VGetty Images\u000aAfter Hillary lost the election there were a lot of people out there who were praising what a gracious loser she was.\u000aIn fact, one story was going around about how Hillary ran into a jogger while walking in the woods and the two of them took a picture together.\u000aThe jogger posted on social media about how warm and upbeat Hillary was despite losing the election.\u000aSounds nice right?\u000aMaybe not. It looks like this jogger may not have randomly bumped into Hillary after all.\u000aMargot Gerster was out hiking with her daughter when she ran into Hillary and Bill Clinton in the upstate New York town of Chappaqua, where the Clintons have a home.\u000aShe took a photo with the former first lady who beamed from ear to ear, appearing to have had the weight of the world lifted from her shoulders as she stood next to Gerster.\u000aClinton was said to have been out walking her dogs with former president Bill Clinton, when Gerster spotted them.\u000aHowever, some critics allege that their meeting while hiking was staged and not random at all.\u000aAdding more fuel to those claims is the fact that its actually not the first time theyve met.\u000aWhen Gerster was in high school, her mother held a fundraiser for Clinton at Crabtrees Kittle House in Chappaqua.\u000aGerster and her sister posed for a photo with Clinton inside the restaurant which happens to be one of the politicians favorites, as the siblings smiled next to a beaming Clinton.\u000aThe fundraiser their family hosted may have been during the period of time Clinton was running for senator or when she served as senator for New York.\u000aGerster has since removed both photos from her profile on Facebook.\u000aHeres a picture from Gersters Facebook page that has been taken down.\u000aFrom Michael Smith News:\u000aThis is Margot Gerster with Hillary. Margots worked on Hillarys campaign. They are close and have been for years.\u000aCould the two of them have randomly bumped into each other?\u000aOf course. She lives in a small community.\u000aBut Hillary doesnt really deserve the benefit of the doubt on things like this anymore.\u000aWhy remove the photo from Facebook if you arent hiding something?\u000aDefinitely a strange development

VIf pooping is comfortable, things are (literally) going well\u000aiStock/Sarah Musselman\u000aPooping shouldn't require too much pushing. Likewise, bowel movements shouldn't hurt. Ideally, you should "evacuate" your waste with almost zero effort and feel as though you've fully emptied yourself, Princeton, New Jersey-based gastroenterologist Anish Sheth, MD, author of What's Your Poo Telling You?, told Time. (Related: Here are some of your weirdest pooping habits, explained by science.)\u000aBrown is best\u000aiStock/kilks\u000aStool should be any shade of brown or green. "Typically, the food you eat takes three days from consumption to becoming waste," says Dr. Neal. "If stool is on the greener side, it may have taken a shorter time to digest, but it's generally no cause for concern." If stool appears black or tarry, it may be evidence of blood (read on for more about that). "The darker the stool, the higher up in your GI tract the blood is likely coming from," Dr. Sheth told Time. He explains that blood emanating from ulcers or stomach problems will darken as it passes through your digestive system.\u000aToo few or too many bowel movements can indicate trouble\u000aiStock/gmcoop\u000aWhile everyone has his or her own "normal," having bowel movements three times a week or less is the common definition of constipation. (Related: Here are surprising reasons you're suddenly constipated.) On the flip side, it's harder to say what constitutes too many daily visits to the potty: Some people, due to genetics or lifestyle, are super poopers and need to do some business three or more times a day. That's okay, as long as you're consistent with your own routine, since the real sign of trouble is when you experience a significant change in bowel movement patterns. "If your digestive clock suddenly goes from three times a week to three times a day, that could be a sign of an underlying condition and shouldn't be ignored," says Dr. Neal. Slight changes in the frequency of bowel movements or the consistency of your stool, however, generally don't indicate a problem. "Maybe you ate something that didn't agree with your stomach, or perhaps you were a little dehydrated," says Dr. Neal. "These and many other routine factors can change the color, size, frequency, and consistency of your stool."\u000aSuper stinky stools may mean something is off\u000aiStock/Enrico Fianchini\u000aBowel movements that leave your housemates running for cover often have to do with what you eat, but may be a sign of a medical condition. "Food that's not digested properly reaches the colon and starts a fermentation process that turns sugar into gas," explains Dr. Neal. "That can produce a foul-smelling stool." A healthy digestive system will break down food in your small intestine and likely not have as much food left to reach the colon to begin the fermentation process. If your stools go beyond the normal unpleasant, but familiar odor, talk to your doctor. You may have a food intolerance or sensitivity that needs to be addressed. (Related: Here are clear signs you could have IBS.)\u000aVery loose poop (but not diarrhea) may be sign of celiac disease\u000aiStock/omersukrugoksu\u000aAlthough celiac affects only about 1 percent of the population, it's estimated that 83 percent of Americans who have celiac disease don't know they have it, according to the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness. Signs in your stool may be one of the majorand possibly the onlyindications you have it, says Prevention. With celiac disease, your body is unable to tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Eating gluten destroys villi (the tiny, fingerlike protrusions lining your small intestines) and you're unable to absorb nutrients from the foods you eat. This contributes to the loose stools you could have several times a day. Talk to your doctor about whether you should be screened for celiac disease. Switching to a gluten-free diet can aid absorption, firm up your stools, and address any other related symptoms such as fatigue, pain, bloating, depression, or rashes. (Related: Here are 11 silent signs you have celiac disease.)\u000aThe occasional floater is perfectly normal\u000aiStock/mauro grigollo\u000aWhen poop floats instead of sinks it may mean you have excess gas in your digestive tract, says Prevention. "If you've been eating lots of beans, sprouts, cabbage, or very large meals, it's perfectly normal for stool to float because of gas, and it's not a cause for concern," says Dr. Sheth. However, if floaters become more common for you or you spot an oil-slick appearance, it could mean something is preventing your body from being able to absorb fats from food. For instance, inflammation or an infection in your pancreas could prevent you from producing enough digestive enzymes. A food allergy or infection could be damaging the lining of your intestines that's affecting absorption, too. Ask your doctor for a stool sample test to see if there's fat that shouldn't be there. Dr. Sheth says additional workups may be necessary to get to the bottom of the problem.\u000aSurprise! You can be regular but still constipated\u000aiStock/Wavebreakmedia\u000aSome people assume that if they go to the bathroom every day then they're not backed up. "But if your stool is consistently hard and comes out in pieces rather than a soft, single piece that passes without much effort, you may be constipated," Dr. Sheth told Prevention. The most common culprit is inadequate fiber intake. The average U.S. adult only downs about 15 grams of fiber a daya fraction of the recommended 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men. Read labels and keep a food journal for a week to track how much fiber you're actually taking in. If you're falling short, bulk up your diet with additional fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Don't forget to hydrate either. According to research in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, fluid intake is the biggest predictor of constipation, Men's Health noted. People who consume less water are more likely to suffer constipation than those who drink more. (Related: Check out these foods that can cause constipation.\u000aStool shape can signal trouble\u000aiStock/TheDman\u000aResearch suggests that the healthiest stool resembles smooth sausage links. "Sometimes it can be a little bit on the firmer sidewhere it's shaped like a sausage and has a few cracks on the surfaceall the way to soft, semi-formed blobs," gastroenterologist Richard J. Saad, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, told Men's Health. Anything harder or softer than that can be a sign something's wrong. (Check out the Bristol Stool Scale, a handy medical aid that classifies the form of feces into seven categories.) While deviations in form (or frequency) could be a symptom of something as simple as constipation, they could also indicate a more serious problem, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, a bowel obstruction, or maybe even colon or stomach cancer, says T. Lee Baumann, MD, a medical consultant based in Birmingham, Alabama, and the author of Clearing the Air: Art of the Bowel Movement. If constipation isn't the issue, make an appointment with your GP, ASAP. This is especially 1 if what you see in the toilet looks like thin ribbons or pencil-sized strandsa possible sign of a bowel obstruction or even a symptom of colon cancer.\u000aMedication can mess with your bowel movements\u000aiStock/solidcolours\u000aGot the runs? A host of meds may stimulate your system. According to Men's Health, the biggest culprits are antibiotics, NSAID pain relievers, magnesium-containing antacids, and proton pump inhibitors for heartburn. If you suspect one of these is responsible for a rush to flush, talk to your doctor about adjusting your dose or medication.\u000aSome drugs can affect the hue of your poo\u000aiStock/txking\u000aCertain OTC medications, such as Pepto-Bismol, can turn your stool black. It occurs when sulfur in your digestive tract combines with bismuth, the drug's active ingredient, and forms bismuth sulfide, a black-colored substance. The discoloration is temporary and harmless and may linger several days after you stop popping Pepto. (Related: Check out these natural stomach soothers.)\u000aBlood in your stool is always a red flag\u000aiStock/kledge\u000aIf you see even a small amount of blood in your feces on a recurring basis, talk to your doctor. "Blood can be a sign of hemorrhoids, anal fissures, pre-cancerous colon polyps, or an inflammatory bowel disease," gastroenterologist Vasudha Dhar, MD, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University, told everydayhealth.com. In the worst-case scenario, it could be a sign of cancer.

"Support the good. Lobby against what we disagree on. No one is bigger than us all." \u000a The owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC's "Shark Tank," who often roiled Trump during the lengthy campaign after initially appearing open to the idea of a Trump presidency, then posted a verse from the Pledge of Allegiance. \u000a "One Nation.

VEvery presidential election, liberal celebrities always vow to leave the country if a Republican wins. They act like people actually care about their threats. Everyday Americans have way too much on their mind to worry about some reality-detached Hollywood multimillionaire claiming hes going to move to Canada if Trump wins. As if Trump gives a you-know-what about their threats.\u000aAnd why do they say theyre moving to Canada? Why dont they say theyre moving to Mexico? Why are they so racist against Hispanics? Why do they only want to live around people who look and act like them?\u000aThere were quite a few celebrities who said they were going to leave if Trump won the White House. Now, theyve predictably back-pedaled.\u000aComedian Amy Schumer said in September that shes going to have to learn to speak Spanish and learn a new comedy routine, because shes moving to Spain if Trump wins. Its beyond my comprehension if Trump won. Its too crazy, she said.\u000aWhat does she say now? First of all the interview where I said I would move was in London and was said in jest, she said on Instagram. Not that anyone needs more than a headline to count something as official news. Anyone saying pack your bags is just as disgusting as anyone who voted for this racist homophobic openly disrespectful woman abuser. So, she was only joking. I mean, she is a comedian.\u000aAl Sharpton also said he was leaving the country in the apocalyptic event that Trump won the general. If Donald Trump is the nominee, Im open to support anyone, while Im also reserving my ticket to get outta here if he wins, only because hed probably have me deported anyway, he said earlier this year in February.\u000aIs he sticking to his word now? All of us said that. That was said in jest. Were not going anywhere. Clearly, it was said in jest. If thats the comfort they got, they might as well get ready for an uncomfortable ride. Okay, whatever you say.\u000aBreaking Bad star Bryan Cranston vowed to leave if Trump were elected President. I would definitely move, he said. Its not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it wont. Well, it did. So, is he moving?\u000aAlthough shocked and disappointed by the outcome, I hope the pres-elect will work to unify our wounded country. I sincerely wish him success\u000a Bryan Cranston (@BryanCranston) November 9, 2016\u000aSinger Cher tweeted during the summer that if Trump won, Im moving to Jupiter. Wait, as in Jupiter, Florida? Or the gas giant? I guess well never know for sure. She hasnt weighed in as to whether shes leaving yet now that the world is coming to an end.\u000aMiley Cyrus said shed move out da country, but she has since accepted a Trump presidency.\u000aOther celebrities who threatened to leave include actor Samuel L. Jackson, Lena Dunham, Barbra Streisand, Whoopi Goldberg, and many others. My guess is that theyve all either changed their minds or were only joking.

VBella Hadid showing off her toned body in the beach. Image Source: Instagram/@bellahadid\u000aWhen she was announced as part of the Victorias Secret Fashion Show lineup, Yolanda Fosters younger daughter was over the moon. But as with all high profile modeling gigs that involve skimpy lingerie and the whole worlds attention focused on your runway walk, the gig comes with a heavy price. Pun intended, 20-year-old Bella Hadid has had to shed so much weight to look toned and ready for the VS show, that she actually voiced out how much she disliked the results. What kind of work went into the Bella Hadid diet that made her so skinny?\u000aThe IMG Worldwide talent surprised tabloids with her drastic weight loss, which is to say she wasnt especially stocky to begin with. On one hand, her Instagram (@bellahadid) showcases her immense rise to popularity, nabbing designer brand endorsements such as Calvin Klein and Dior. But on the other hand, fans are noticing how thin she is beginning to look, to the point of unhealthiness.\u000aAccording to The Daily Mail UK, Bella has spoken out against her detractors who are saying she is promoting an unnerving image to young girls. The sister of Gigi Hadid clarified that she didnt mean to lose so many pounds for the VS show, and that her weight has always fluctuated anyway. Just because shes a model doesnt mean she is immune to insecurity. I wish my a** was bigger, she mourned.\u000a @mishacollection ? @ninomunoz ? @michelleaznavorian\u000aA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Oct 12, 2016 at 7:31pm PDT\u000aBella Hadid Diet, Revealed! What she had to do to lose so much weight\u000aCommitting to the strict lifestyle that comes with the job, you would be surprised with just how much exercise is involved in the Bella Hadid diet. She revealed to PEOPLE magazine that she borrowed her sisters trainer, Rob Piela, from the Gotham Gym in NYC. She credits him for her strict regimen, and says that if she is with another trainer, she freaks out.\u000aTraining every day for three hours, Bellas routine of choice is boxing for toning, and consumes a high protein diet even while traveling. She rarely indulges in plane food, though she was a fan of pasta as her cheat meal. And while her dieting and exercise have definitely shown results, Celebrity Dirty Laundry is pointing a finger at her brand of hypocrisy. On one hand, Bella wishes she gained back the weight she lost for the show, and is abhorring the loss of her curves. But on the other hand, both Hadid sisters are aware of the price to pay when it comes to climbing the ranks of high fashion. Its either size 0, or bust.\u000aWhat are your thoughts surrounding Bella Hadids interview about weight loss and diet?

VAbout Vladimir Putin\u000aCurrent President of Russia Vladimir Putin has an estimated net worth of $70 billion. He has been serving the post since May 7, 2012. Since 2008, he has been serving as the Chairman of political party, United Russia.\u000aFrom 1999 through 2000, Putin served as Russias Prime Minister. A year later, he became the countrys president, a position he held until 2008. During the 2008 presidential election, Dmitry Medvedev won as President.

VVern and Nanette had six kids, but they desperately wanted another child. One night, Nanette had a distinct dream about a little girl named Emily. \u000aThough Emily was a figment of her imagination, I knew that she was mine. \u000aThe couple had a hard time getting pregnant again, but just when they decided to adopt, Nanette got pregnant with her seventh child. Still, Nanette couldnt stop thinking about that little girl she envisioned so clearly. \u000aVern and Nanette flew to the National Adoption Center in Ukraine and began searching through photos of orphaned children for hours. They immediately stopped on a black-and-white photo of a little girl with a big bow in her hair. \u000aVern and Nanette knew: This was Emily. This was their daughter. They got the approval to adopt her. \u000aUpon returning home to the states, Vern and Nanette quickly fell in love with Emily, but they also made a startling discovery. They had no idea that Emily had a sibling who was still in Ukraine  an older sister named Elizabeth who was more like a mother to Emily, since their birth parents were out of the picture. \u000aSix months after learning of Elizabeths existence, Vern and Nanette received a photo of her in the mail. \u000aAnd soon after that, they received a handwritten letter from Elizabeth herself. \u000aWhen Vern and Nanette read what Elizabeth had to say to them  the people who took Emily away from her  they made another stunning realization\u000aWatch the video below to see how this story unfolds, and please SHARE it with your friends on Facebook!

VYour soon-to-be first couple. \u000aMuch has been made over Donald Trumps multiple marriages: The nations 45th president-elect D and a noted traditional marriage advocate D has been married to third wife Melania Knauss since 2005, but was divorced twice before that.\u000aHis first marriage to Ivana Zelnickova lasted from 1977 to 1992, reportedly ending in a $25 million settlement for Ivana. He was married to second wife Marla Maples from 1993 to 1999. He has children with all three women.\u000aTrump created a media firestorm when he left Ivana for Maples in the early 90s D and in typical fashion, he was all too willing to comment on it. \u000aWhen a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of assa good one!there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left, he was quoted as saying in Vanity Fair in September 1990.\u000aThe three Mrs. Trumps: Ivanka Trump (left), Marla Maples (center) and Melania Trump.\u000aWhile Trump will be the first president to have multiple failed marriages under his belt, he wont be Americas first divorced president: Ronald Reagan, the countrys 40th commander in chief, was the first and only other president to have taken office after going through a divorce. \u000aThe actor-turned-conservative politician split from his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, decades before he ran for president. He remarried in 1952 to Nancy Reagan, who became first lady when he took office in 1981. \u000aRonald Reagan with first wife Jane Wyman (left) and with his second wife Nancy (right).\u000aReagans marital history was seemingly a non-issue when he ran for office, but divorce had certainly been problematic for candidates in the past. In 1963, former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York married his second wife Happy Rockefeller soon after both had divorced their first spouses. The New York Times speculates that the ensuing public controversy may have cost him the Republican presidential nomination in 1964.\u000aBy the time Reagan and his picture-perfect (second) marriage came around, Americans were ready for a divorc to take office, writes political scientists Alexander Heard and Michael Nelson in their book Presidential Selection.\u000aLike Southernness and Catholicism, divorce was long considered a barrier to the presidency. Yet Reagan campaigned in 1976 and was elected in 1980 with scarcely a hint that his divorce should be held against him, they write. Societys tolerance for divorce had grown so great during the 1960s that it no longer was a barrier when candidate Reagan encountered it.\u000aAnd it was definitely not a barrier in 2016 either! \u000aRelated Stories\u000a Donald Trump Is Honored To Have The Greatest Temperament, Donald Trump Says \u000a Hey, Melania Trump, Have You Read Your Husband's Tweets? \u000a Trump Called Pregnant Melania A 'Monster' And A 'Blimp' \u000a Heres Some Other Quotes Melania Trump Could Make Her Own

VMartin Luther King called Marcus Garvey the first man to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny. His philosophy of black self-determination influenced black leaders from Nelson Mandela to Jomo Kenyatta to Malcolm X.\u000aAt a time when lynchings still occurred, Garvey was a firebrand who turned soapbox speeches on a Harlem street corner into a mass movement for black rights. By 1920, just six years after arriving in the United States from his native Jamaica, he had organized the largest ever march of black people on the streets of Harlem. People called him the Black Mosesthe man who would lead them out of the downtrodden legacy of slavery.\u000aBut instead of achieving lasting global celebrity like those he inspired, Garvey faded into obscurity, his name one that might seem only vaguely familiar except to those well-versed in black history.\u000aMarcus Garvey mural in Kingston.\u000aNow a movement is underway to restore Marcus Garveys legacy by asking US president Barack Obama to issue a pardon for what many consider to be Garveys wrongful conviction for mail fraud. Supporters include the families of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and Bob Marley. Jamaicas prime minister Andrew Holness also supports the effort.\u000a They are starting to call Black Lives Matter a terrorist group. Its no different than what they did 100 years ago with Marcus Garvey, The time has come when he should be exonerated, he said during a visit to New York earlier this year.\u000aA presidential pardon for Garvey would be especially symbolic today, with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, advocates say.\u000aBenjamin Crump, a lawyer who has represented several black families including those of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, said the effort is especially symbolic against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u000aWe know now more than ever that this notion that black lives matter, that black experiences matter is at the crux of the national conversation, Crump said.\u000aIn many ways, when you see the young people standing up and taking a stand, it harkens back to what Garvey was trying to do over 100 years ago.\u000aGarvey and the UNIA\u000aAt the heart of Garveys philosophy and his trouble with the law was the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which the 26-year-old Garvey founded in Kingston, Jamaica in 1914. The UNIA was a product of Garveys time and place. Although slavery had been abolished in the 1830s, Garvey came of age in a country where blacks still struggled under a system of land ownership that favored the descendants of white plantation owners.\u000aBlacks needed their own government, their own economy, and their own organizations to be successful in a world that oppressed and marginalized them, Garvey argued. He pictured an explosion of black enterprise from trade within the global black diaspora, and a Pan-African government.\u000aMarcus Garvey.\u000aWhen he moved to the United States in 1916, Garvey found fertile ground for his philosophy in a country where job shortages were causing racial friction in the north and blacks in the Jim Crow south were still subject to vigilante justice at the hands of white mobs.\u000aGarveys answer to escape the suffering: look to Africa. He founded a shipping company called the Black Star Liner Corporation whose mission was to help the African diaspora trade and, ultimately, to help black people return to the continent.\u000aHoover and the Black Star Liner\u000aGarveys huge following caught the eye of J. Edgar Hoover, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was heading up efforts to arrest and deport suspected Communist and radicals in the U.S. Hoover described Garvey as one of the most prominent negro agitators in New York an exceptionally fine orator, creating much excitement among the negroes through his steamship proposition.\u000aAlarmed at Garveys ability to agitate, Hoover decided to try to find a way to deport Garvey, even hiring the agencys first black agent to spy on Garvey and the UNIA.\u000aIn a letter to the agencys New York office in 1919, Hoover wrote of Garvey:\u000aUnfortunatelyhe has not as yet violated any federal law whereby he could be proceeded against on the grounds of being an undesirable alien, from the point of view of deportation. It occurs to me, however, from the attached clipping that there might be some proceeding against him for fraud in connection with his Black Star Line propaganda and for this reason I am transmitting the communication to you for your appropriate attention.\u000aHoovers plan worked C Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 in a decision that is now considered by at least some historians to have been trumped up.\u000aGarveys conviction on a charge of mail fraud was basically a technicality, Barbara Bair, a curator and public historian with the Library of Congress, said in a PBS question and answer session on Garveys life, and quoted Garveys own assessment in 1923 when he said the case against him involves not Marcus Garvey but the existence of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (U.N.I.A.). The ideals of the Universal Negro Improvement Association are on trial.\u000aThe allegations against Garvey were tied to the representation of the Black Star Line on promotional materials to sell stock in the company. An image of the ship appeared on the advertisements even though the ship was under construction at the time and not yet officially owned by the UNIA.\u000aExile\u000aGarvey spent two years in a U.S. jail and, although President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927 under public pressure, Garvey was deported and never allowed back into the United States.\u000aHe was welcomed back to Jamaica with throngs of supporters in 1927, but Garveys U.S. criminal record dogged him in the following decades.\u000aFor a long time, there was a concerted effort to smear Garvey even in Jamaica, up to my generation, people were talking about, Garvey is a con man, said Steven Golding, the president the UNIA in Kingston, who is in his 40s.\u000aUS influence also made Garveys life difficult elsewhere. For instance, the UNIA had secured a land grant in Liberia which was later withdrawn, only to be reassigned to the US-based Firestone Rubber Company.\u000aThe United States wasnt the only country to make Garvey a persona non grata. Garveys efforts to go to Africa were stymied by colonial governments wary of his organizing efforts.\u000aThey didnt want him there because they feared what his presence there would do, Golding said. Garvey did, in fact, influence several people who led decolonization efforts in Africa including Nelson Mandela, Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, and Kenneth Kaunda, the UNIAs Golding said.\u000aEven back in Jamaica, his defiance landed him in hot water. He was charged with contempt of court when he suggested that corrupt judges should be brought to heel.\u000aGarveys conviction in the U.S. turned out to be the beginning of a slow unravelling that marginalized him globally and ended in London in 1940 when he died after the sight of his own obituary in the paper triggered a heart attack.\u000aRedemption?\u000aIn 1964, two years after Jamaica won independence, Garveys body was brought back to Jamaica for burial and he was declared the nations first national hero.\u000aLast month, Jamaica took the first step in clearing the names of all of its national heroes, including Garvey. All of Jamaicas national heroes are freedom fighters from Sam Sharpe, who led one of the countrys most important slave uprisings, to Norman Manley, the first Prime Minister of independent Jamaica. Some were sentenced to death by the Crown for treason after organizing slave revolts or protests.\u000aJamaica is hoping that expunging the records of its national heroes will set an example for the U.S.\u000aWe have an opportunity to make a definitive statement to the international community with the passing of this Bill, Olivia Grange, Jamaicas minister of culture said in a statement to parliament last month.\u000aA previous bid to get a posthumous pardon for Garvey failed in 2011 when the Obama administration said it would only grant pardons to the living.\u000aPosthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. Bill Clinton issued a pardon to Henry O. Flipper, a former slave who was also the first black West Point cadet charged with conduct unbecoming an officer. George W. Bush pardoned a man named Charles Winters for smuggling bombers into Israel in the 1940s.\u000aFor Crump, pardoning Garvey would send the message that standing up against racial discrimination will not be prosecuted.\u000aNow they are starting to call Black Lives Matter, in certain circles, a terrorist group. Its no different than what they did 100 years ago with Marcus Garvey, Crump said.\u000aThis pattern and practice of discrimination against people who stand up for their rights and declare that My life matters too, is something that continues to this day.

VTim Kaine delivered a heartfelt speech Wednesday morning about Hillary Clintons strength and perseverance in the face of sexism, despite her loss.\u000aKaine introduced Clinton on stage in New York City after Trump won the presidency with over 270 electoral votes. He quoted writer William Faulkner, saying, They killed us but they aint whupped us yet, and spoke of being proud of the history maker he ran with.\u000aHe also noted the challenges Clinton pushed to overcome as a woman running for federal office in the United States.\u000aMy wife and I are so proud of Hillary Clinton. She has been and is a great history maker in everything she has done, Kaine said. She has made history in a nation that is so good in so many things, but has made it so uniquely difficult for a women to make it into a federal office.  Last night she won the popular vote from Americans. That is an amazing accomplishment.\u000aUnable to play video. Neither flash nor html5 is supported!\u000aAs the Guardian pointed out, people dont trust women as much as men. Just 30 percent of people surveyed in a CNN poll conducted in July said that they considered Clinton trustworthy, while 43 percent thought Trump was. The double standard is hard to ignore.\u000aOn Wednesday, Clinton admitted that the defeat was painful, but that she has hope for the nation and for all the little girls out there who dare to dream.\u000aNow, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will  and hopefully sooner than we might think right now, she said. And to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.\u000aHearts collectively broke across the country.\u000aJustin Sullivan via Getty Images

VProtests against the election of Donald Trump broke out across the country last week. (Getty)\u000aWith the 2016 Presidential election and victory by Donald Trump nearly a week in the past, million of people were left stunned  and wondering, can Hillary Clinton still win? With protests against Trumps election continuing into the weekend in numerous cities across the country, and hate crimes committed by apparent Trump supporters reported in the highest numbers since the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, millions of Americans are searching for any legal way to reverse the results of the election.\u000aBy Saturday, millions had signed an online petition asking for the results  and Trump  to be thrown out, and for Clinton to be declared the winner and next president in his place.\u000aThe fact that Clinton won the popular vote, ending up with a 1.2 percentage point lead according to The New York Times, has only intensified the calls to prevent Trump from becoming president. But do Trumps opponents have a case? Is there any basis on which Clinton could still win the 2016 presidential election after all?\u000aHeres what you need to know.\u000a1. Clinton Has Already Conceded the Election to Trump\u000aIn most elections, the losing candidate delivers a public concession speech late on election night, when the results of the voting become clear. But Clinton waited until the following morning to deliver her speech, in which she admitted defeat and told her supporters  and the American people  that Trump would indeed become the 45th and next president of the United States.\u000aBut does the fact that Clinton has conceded make any difference? The short answer is  no. Political concession speeches are merely offered as courtesies and carry no legal weight whatsoever.\u000aIn fact, while losing political candidates would often privately congratulate the winners, the tradition of the public concession speech at least in presidential campaigns coincided with the rise of television. Though Democrat Al Smith conceded in a radio-broadcast speech in his 1928 election landslide loss to Herbert Hoover, the practice of regular public concessions did not begin until 1952, when Democrat Adlai Stevenson conceded to Dwight D. Eisenhower in a televised address.\u000aIn other words, if there were a legal way for Clinton to still win the election, the fact that she has already conceded would be irrelevant.\u000a2. The Electoral College Has Not Voted, And Thats the Real Election\u000aA voter fills out her ballot on Election Day. But her vote, and those of other voters, arent the votes that count. (Getty)\u000aThough more voters chose Clinton than Trump nationwide, she lost anyway, because the U.S. presidential election is really 50 separate elections  one for each state. And in each state, voters are not actually voting for a presidential candidate, but for electors, that is, people picked by state political party officials who will then vote in what, under the U.S. Constitution is the second presidential election and only one that actually counts  the Electoral College vote.\u000aClinton failed to win enough states to give her 270 electoral votes, a majority of the Electoral College.\u000aBut neither the Constitution nor any federal law requires that the electors vote for the candidate who won their state. In theory, anyway, they can vote for whoever they want. Thats why an online petition on the site Change.org, which has already received more than 4 million signatures, circulated online after the election, calling on electors in the states won by Trump to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.\u000aThe reason?\u000aTrump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic, the petition says. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.\u000aThe chances, however, that the petition works as more than a symbolic gesture, and actually turns the election in Clintons favor remain remote. The Electoral College has never reversed itself  even though the 2016 election is the second in the last five elections that the candidate with more votes came out the loser, and sixth time in U.S history. The last time it happened was in 2000, when Democrat Al Gore lost to George W. Bush, despite the fact that more voters cast ballots for Gore.\u000aBut individual electors have gone rogue rather frequently. At least one faithless elector has cast a ballot for the wrong candidate in nine of the last 17 elections, most recently in 2004 when one elector voted for John Edwards, who was running on the Democratic ticket as vice-president.\u000aThe electors will not cast their ballots until December 19, so anything could happen  but probably wont.\u000a3. Some States Could Recount the Votes\u000aSome of the states lost by Clinton were extremely close. Michigan, for example, with its 16 electoral votes, was decided by just 11,223 votes out of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast. Pennsylvania with 20 electoral votes went to Trump by just 68,236 votes  with almost 6 million total votes cast there.\u000aBut an automatic recount in Michigan happens only when the vote difference is 2,000 votes to fewer, and in Pennsylvania when the difference is 0.5 percentage points or less.\u000aOtherwise candidates would need to make an allegation of fraud or a serious error in the vote count to demand a recount, and Clinton has shown no signs that she is willing to do that. Even though her concession speech is not legally binding and she could change her mind, no reported statement she has made indicates that she is leaning in that direction, or that she believes she lost do to vote fraud.\u000aHypothetically, though, even if Clinton demanded recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania and somehow won them both, she would still be two votes short of 270. Wisconsin, which also finished in a razor-close race, could provide the electoral votes to put Clinton over 270, in this hypothetical scenario. But Wisconsin has a three-day deadline to demand a recount, and that has already passed.\u000a4. Trump is Facing a Trial Before he Takes Office  and he Might Lose\u000aDonald Trump must appear in court prior to being inaugurated as president. (Getty)\u000aTrump is facing a trial date of November 28 in San Diego, California, over allegations that he committed fraud with his profit-making Trump University real estate seminar business. Trump seems at least somewhat concerned about the trial. His lawyers filed a motion Saturday asking to put off the trial until Trump is safely inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president on January 20.\u000aThe problem for Trump opponents, however, is that even in the Trump University lawsuit or in the other estimated 75 lawsuits Trump currently faces, he is facing only civil penalties  not criminal penalties. While he may end up needing to compensate the victims of his alleged scam or even pay punitive damages, nothing in any of the legal actions would prevent him from assuming the presidency on January 20.\u000aAnd even if he were hit with criminal charges, as president, he would have the authority to grant himself a complete and unconditional pardon, if he chooses to do so.\u000a5. Milions of Votes Have Still Not Been Counted\u000aMillions of votes have not yet been counted, and final vote totals will not be known for weeks. (Getty)\u000aWhile Clinton already holds a narrow but clear lead in the popular vote nationwide, California officials on Thursday reported that more than 4.4 million ballots had not yet been counted, most of them mail-in ballots which voters use commonly in the countrys most populated state.\u000aThere were about 8.5 million California votes tabulated on election night, but with the extra 4.4 million from California alone, Clintons popular vote lead is likely to swell. Outstanding, uncounted ballots also remain in other states, including Washington and New York.\u000aAgain, however, the problem for Clinton supporters looking for a way that she can still win the election is simply that Clinton already won California, Washington and New York  by substantial margins. Increasing her lead in those states will not bring her any new electoral votes, changing the results of the election and preventing Trump from taking the White House in January.

V(Facebook)\u000aA Memphis man said he found a 2-year-old girl roaming alone in the middle of the street at 3 a.m.\u000aIn a video posted to Facebook by Soloman Jones, the man who found the girl, he can be seen holding the toddler as she lies on his shoulder.\u000aHere comes a 2-year-old child walking up the street crying I called the police cause I dont know who this child belong to, Jones says to the camera.\u000aJones told InsideEdition.com that he and his friend were sitting on his porch when they spotted the girl.\u000aWe see this little girl walking up the street at 3:30 a.m. and its cold outside. We knew something wasnt right. She said, Im looking for my momma,'" Jones said.\u000aHe said he tried to get the girl to point out her house but she couldnt, so he called police.\u000aIn another video posted by Jones, police are seen arriving to the scene and trying to figure out where the girls house is.\u000aJones said the girl was eventually reunited with her parents, who were unaware she had gotten out.\u000aJones said he didnt mean to bash the parents in his video; he was just emotional about finding the girl.\u000aI see them [her parents] sometimes. They are pretty good people. Everybody makes mistakes. They arent neglectful. You dont have to be a bad person to let your kids get out, Jones said. I just want folks to make sure they keep their doors tight. Anything could have happened if the wrong people would have found her.

In response to acts of violence and intimidation against minorities in the wake of Trumps victory, Ryan stated that those people committing those acts arent Republicans because they are the party of Lincoln.\u000aFirst of all, I hate it that people feel this way, Ryan said. And second of all, they should not.\u000aTapper pressed Ryan to accept and acknowledge these incidents are occurring in the country. \u000aThe Speaker said that he heard the videos that Tapper had played earlier and that their terrible. Thats not Republicans, Ryan insisted. We are the party of Lincoln.\u000aWatch the interview above, via CNN.

VDonald Trump named two top advisers to his administration Sunday, tapping Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus to be his new chief of staff and Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News, as chief strategist and senior counselor.\u000a\u000a"Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again," Trump said in the release.\u000a\u000aIt's an unusual arrangement that could create two power centers in the new White House. The campaign statement, which listed Bannon's role first, referred to the two men as "equal partners."\u000a\u000a"Bannon and Priebus will continue the effective leadership team they formed during the campaign, working as equal partners to transform the federal government, making it much more efficient, effective and productive," it said.\u000a\u000aThe dynamic will continue the structure of the two men's roles in the campaign, with Priebus and Bannon working as partners, but with very different Trump constituencies to manage. Both Priebus and Bannon were highly involved with working out the arrangement, a source familiar with the decision said.\u000a\u000aPriebus should be a reassuring presence to establishment Republicans still uncertain about what a Trump White House will look like. The pick signals that Trump may look to build bridges in Washington and keep continuity with longtime Republican agendas, as opposed to make waves from the beginning.\u000a\u000aPriebus is among the longest serving chairmen of the Republican Party, and has generally been popular amid different factions within the party. He is largely credited with building the ground game that elected Trump and with helping to unite his party after a divisive primary that resulted in many Republicans shunning Trump's nomination.\u000a\u000aThe news of Priebus' hiring was first reported by Politico\u000a\u000aReince Priebus will be chief of staff, source who spoke to Trump tells me. Announcement could come in the next half hour\u000a\u000aTrump's choice for chief of staff was believed to come down to Priebus and Bannon. In a repeat of the tumultuous process that led Trump to tap Indiana Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running-mate, GOP officials pressed the President-elect to go with Priebus for the chief of staff job.\u000a\u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump on Thursday to pick Priebus, a source told CNN on Friday. Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, has also said privately he is supportive of that decision.\u000a\u000aAfter the announcement, a spokesman for Ryan said the speaker was pleased by the decision.\u000a\u000a"The speaker is very happy for his friend and ready to get to work," said Doug Andres, his spokesman.\u000a\u000aPriebus has served as a negotiator between the party and Trump. When Ryan did not initially endorse Trump, Priebus organized meetings and helped diffuse tension between the two when Ryan criticized Trump and Trump hit back.\u000a\u000aSources say Priebus and Trump have grown very close over the course of the campaign. Priebus had a leadership role in Trump's debate prep and traveled with him in the latter days of the campaign. Many of the RNC's top operatives were installed in Trump Tower to work closely with the campaign.\u000a\u000aDuring the campaign, Trump often said he would look to politicians to help him govern, including his selection of Pence -- another Ryan friend and ally -- as vice president. But he also ran a campaign as an outsider, saying he would "drain the swamp" of Washington.\u000a\u000aPriebus earned Trump's trust in the final months of the campaign, as he steered the RNC's resources behind Trump's candidacy despite Republican officials urging Priebus to abandon Trump and instead help down-ballot candidates.\u000a\u000aAs Trump's candidacy was engulfed in the controversy stemming from a 2005 tape in which he boasted about being able to grope and kiss women without their consent, and as sexual assault allegations surfaced the next week, Priebus stood fast behind Trump and worked to salvage his campaign.\u000a\u000aTrump's debate over the selection demonstrated how he was once again being pulled between a more pragmatic selection with a pick who will enable his outsider persona and bellicose instincts.\u000a\u000aBannon represents bare-knuckle style politics seen as appealing to Trump's most inflammatory instincts, and his initial hiring prompted a raft of criticism from Democrats accusing Trump of embracing the "alt right."\u000a\u000aOn Sunday night the Bannon appointment drew scorn from the office of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.\u000a\u000a"President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House," said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for the Nevada Democrat, who is retiring from Congress.\u000a\u000aAnd Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted, "We at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he \u005cu0026 his alt-right are so hostile to core American values".\u000a\u000aBut Trump ran an outsider campaign and Bannon's hiring signals an intention to keep the insurgent sentiment that propelled his campaign close.\u000a\u000aBannon is a former Navy officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker and has been an executive in the right-wing media for years. He joined Trump's campaign in August alongside new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, after Paul Manafort was fired as campaign manager.\u000a\u000aWhile pundits worried that Bannon's hiring would hasten Trump going way off-message, he had some of his most disciplined weeks of his campaign under Bannon and Conway's leadership, though it was almost derailed by a hot mic video that caught Trump bragging of sexually violent and aggressive behavior toward women.\u000a\u000aA potential White House role for Conway is a possibility. A Trump source says the President-elect has made clear to Conway that he wants her to work in the new administration, but she has not decided whether to do so for several reasons. That includes being mother to four young children.\u000a\u000aCNN is told Conway is more likely to stay outside the government and follow the template of President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign strategist David Plouffe, who opted not to go in the White House.\u000a\u000aConway may follow that model and help the Trump administration by organizing conservative groups and pushing Trump policies and legislation from the outside.\u000a\u000aGiven Conway's exposure through the Trump campaign, she is also poised to make a lot of money working outside of government.\u000a\u000aThis story has been updated.

VThe legend of Dak Prescott\u000aCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Each week, it seems, Dak Prescott answers a different question about his ability to succeed long-term as the Dallas Cowboys' quarterback.\u000aIts understandable, considering the vast majority of the leagues starting quarterbacks were drafted in the first three rounds, with most selected in the first round. Prescott, a fourth-round draft choice, was the 135th player selected.\u000aOn Sunday, Prescott answered the question of whether he could lead the Cowboys to a victory against a winless opponent the week before a game against a big-name opponent like the Pittsburgh Steelers.\u000aDallas 35, Cleveland 10.\u000aIt was the Cowboys largest margin of victory this season and pushed their winning streak to seven games, tied for the longest in franchise history, and the longest since Jason Garrett became head coach midway through the 2010 season.\u000aRookie quarterback Dak Prescott has performed with the poise and leadership of an NFL veteran this season. Scott R. Galvin/USA TODAY Sports\u000aIn the opener, a loss to the New York Giants, Prescott answered the question of whether he could handle starting in the NFL. Against Washington, he answered whether he could lead the Cowboys to a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter.\u000aAgainst Chicago, he answered whether he could win at AT\u005cu0026T Stadium, where the Cowboys had lost eight consecutive home games. Against San Francisco, he answered whether he could play through adversity, rallying the Cowboys from a 14-0 deficit.\u000aAgainst Cincinnati, Prescott answered whether he could beat a good team; and the following week against Green Bay, he answered whether he could win at one of the NFLs hallowed stadiums: Green Bays Lambeau Field.\u000aWhen the Cowboys beat Philadelphia last week, Prescott answered whether he could play poorly for three quarters and still deliver a win.\u000aPrescott has done everything you could ask of a starter.\u000aHe has won, the most important task on his to-do list. The Cowboys have the NFCs best record -- tied with the New England Patriots for the best in the league -- and their point differential of +83 trails only the Patriots, who are +85.\u000aDallas has won four games by at least 14 points and five by at least a touchdown. Theres nothing fluky about Prescott, or the teams performance.\u000aHe has passed for more than 200 yards in each game, with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions.\u000aUnlike last week, when sloppy footwork and the Eagles pass rush caused him to be inaccurate, Prescott stood confidently in the pocket Sunday surveying the field and going through his progressions until finding a worthy target. He didnt force a pass into coverage until his final attempt.\u000aHe finished 21-of-27 for 247 yards and three touchdowns with a passer rating of 141.8, his best of the season. He ran four times and picked up first downs on two different scoring drives.\u000aIt was more concentrating on my footwork, driving off my back foot, and I think I did a good job with it throughout the game, Prescott said. I felt myself a couple of times on my back foot, so I gotta go back and check the film to see if I made progress and did better.\u000aIn the process of helping make the Cowboys a title contender, Prescott has become a leader. Its not because he has a C on his jersey -- he doesnt -- or because the quarterback is supposed to be the leader.\u000aI just try to come in and do the right things on and off the field, and show guys how much I care about this game, he said. If it results in being a leader, then, yeah, Im a leader.\u000aPrescott showed those skills in the second quarter, when Dez Bryant was irate after cornerback Joe Haden was not called for pass interference on an incompletion in the end zone.\u000aNo. 4 is outstanding. The poise, just the way he handles himself, the way he carries himself. The way he keeps people lifted, Bryant said. I wanted to say some things because they didnt call a holding penalty, but Dak was like, 'Lets just get it right. We good.' You need people like that.\u000aI was like, 'Boom' its erased. Lets move on to the next play.\u000aPrescott didnt think it was a big deal.\u000aDez is a guy we need. We dont need him getting emotional, Prescott said. Theyre going to hold him and we know that. Flags might come or they might not come, but we cant let that affect our game.\u000aThe only question left is when will coach Jason Garrett and owner Jerry Jones name him the starter for the rest of the season.

VOct 21, 2016; Talladega, AL, USA; Sprint Cup Series driver Matt Kenseth (20) and driver Kyle Busch (18) and driver Denny Hamlin (11) and driver Martin Truex Jr. (78) practice for the Alabama 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.\u000aNASCAR will review the way three Joe Gibbs Racing drivers ran around at the back of the field at Talladega Superspeedway last month and perhaps even strengthen a rule requiring teams to compete at 100 percent of their ability.\u000aMatt Kenseth, Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch were playing it safe so they would move on to the Round of 8 in NASCARs Sprint Cup championship Chase. They intentionally dropped to the rear of the 40-car field during the pace lap and never tried to race to the lead, trying to avoid a "Big One multi-car accident common at restrictor-plate engine tracks.\u000aThey finished 28th, 29th and 30th, respectively, but the strategy worked. Kenseth and defending series champion Busch have a chance to advance to the Final 4 after Sundays Can-Am 500 at Phoenix International Raceway. Edwards, winner last week at Texas Motor Speedway, is guaranteed a title shot in next weekends series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\u000aAt Talladega, the team certainly deployed a strategy which, candidly, we were not huge fans of, said Steve ODonnell, NASCARs chief racing development executive. We like for fans to have the opportunity to see their (favorite) drivers competing up front, each and every race.\u000aIt was within the rules for the team to deploy that strategy . . . (but) its something I think well take a bigger look at in the offseason. (We want) to make sure if there are certain trends that we see within any team, well take the offseason to address it.\u000aThe Gibbs drivers, including Denny Hamlin, also raced conservatively the following weekend at Martinsville. Hamlin, Kenseth and Busch finished 3-4-5 but the team orders were so frustrating to Busch he sarcastically said: We were so good together that we gave (Jimmie Johnson) the win today. Thats how good JGR is.\u000aTheres little doubt it will be an every driver for himself race at PIR. With Johnson and Edwards locked in to the Final 4, the other three Gibbs drivers, plus Joey Logano, Kevin Harvick and Kurt Busch, need to win or a high finish to race for the title.\u000aCubs inspiration\u000aKurt Busch, eighth in Chase points with a win at Pocono, Pa., is a Chicago Cubs fan and is looking to the World Series champions for inspiration. Buschs No. 41 Monster Energy Chevrolet has generally lacked outright speed for most of the season.\u000aThats what were hopeful for, said Busch, referring to the Cubs Game 7 win over the Cleveland Indians.\u000aIn other sports, its two teams fighting it out. (Each) has a 50 percent chance. In NASCAR . . . its a much lesser of a percentage chance because you have so many other guys who are involved. There are eight of us that are still alive (championship eligible) and two are locked in. That means six of us who are trying to separate themselves and be part of (Homestead.)\u000aSadlers season\u000aVeteran Elliott Sadler has three Xfinity Series wins this year and could have a chance for his first NASCAR championship with a victory or good finish in Saturdays Ticket Galaxy 200. Xfinity is using a similar format to Cup for the first time, with the four drivers advancing to the Homestead finale after PIR.\u000aSadler, 41, has been an emotional winner this year. His sponsor, OneMain Financial, informed him and Dale Earnhardt Jr.s team they wouldnt return in 2017, then reversed that decision a few weeks later.\u000aI didnt know where my career was going to be in July, Sadler said. Yeah, its been emotional for me. Ive been racing since I was 7. Ive been close (to title) before and lost.

VDonald Trump called Mexicans killers and rapists. Donald Trump called women fat and ugly and suggested Megan Kelly was irritable because she was going through her menstrual period. Donald Trump insulted the parents of a slain Bronze Star Muslim American soldier. Donald Trump mocked a reporter with a congenital disability by garishly imitating his contracted limbs. Donald Trump repeatedly lied and quoted grossly inaccurate statistics. Donald Trump shamelessly slandered Somali and Syrian refugees. Donald Trump said he would block Muslims from immigrating to America. Donald Trump had no plan of even minimal substance be it foreign policy, the economy or climate change. Donald Trump, in fact, does not think climate change is a problem at all.\u000aDonald Trump is going to be the 45th president-elect of the United States of America.\u000aThere will be plenty of debate about how this came about. Very profound and insightful etiologies will be constructed for Trumps ascension. Much intellectual contortion will take place to give this national misfortune some sort of silver lining, some measure of respectability.\u000aDont believe any of it. This is an unmitigated political and ethical disaster. And dont buy any of the nonsense about how the genuine grievances of marginalized working class people led to their wanting to elect an outsider to wipe the slate clean.\u000aBecause this is not the result of ignoring white working class voters. That demographic has not been ignored or marginalized more than any American minority. This is not a reaction to corruption or economic injustice. You dont elect a billionaire who has thrived on all the tax and corporate privileges that maintain the status quo to achieve that. This is not the outcome of military adventurism. Hell almost every war in the past fifteen years has kicked off with popular approval. This is the triumph of demagoguery. This is the logical conclusion of a media selling fear and disseminating disinformation for 15 years. This is the culmination of a GOP agenda that was peddling fear and bigotry long before Trump. This not the hunger for change satisfied; this is the demon of hatred possessing.\u000aFear, hatred and dreams of glory D apparently thats all the strategy required to get half of America fired up. Select a few outgroups and identify them as a clear and present danger. Evoke a mythical past flush with riches, glory and moral purity. Lie to the poor and tell them they will have plenty of work and prosper like never before. That is all Trump did and that was all that was necessary.\u000aHere it is then, another lesson in history and human psychology that the world will refuse to learn from. People are not and never will be rational beings. We are driven by feeling, emotion, instinct, impulse. To grab our attention and sway our will, it is the emotive that must be evoked.\u000aThe serpent has always lain patiently coiled underneath all that cortical camouflage. It just needs a Fox News and a Trump to unleash the forked tongue, the fangs and the venom.\u000aThe task at hand is clear. Progressives must spend the next four years unifying and developing political leadership. Minorities must fight together and recognize that standing up for discrimination against others is no longer a choice, it is a necessity. The only way bigotry can be fought is by fighting it together. An there will be plenty of bigotry to fight, let there be no doubt about that.\u000aThis great nation has survived much; it will survive the megalomania and incivility of Donald Trump.

Terrified, she quickly ran into her parents room and hid in their closet, crouching over as she dialed 911.\u000a\u000aThe operator who picked up her call was 12-year veteran police dispatcher Angie Rivera. Angie immediately realized she needed to communicate with Doyin using a calm, reassuring voice.\u000a\u000aAs Doyin and Angie remained on the line, Angie could hear the intruders getting closer to the closet.

VWhen Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, he gave her the stunning 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire ring that his late mother, Princess Diana, wore during her marriage to Prince Charles. And when the two tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in London in 2011, Kate added a gold band to sit perfectly next to her sparkler. But despite the duchess of Cambridge's new jewelry, there was no big exchanging of rings, because Prince William never got one. The reason? It's just not his style. Shortly before the couple's big day, the palace released a statement about his decision to ditch tradition and go ringless, saying, "It is simply down to personal preference. It was something the couple discussed but Prince William isn't one for jewelry." Seeing as how William and Kate are one of the most famous couples on the planet, they would be hard-pressed to find someone who wasn't aware of their sweet romance. So there you have it.

(Kent County Correctional Facility)\u000aAn 18-year-old Michigan man now faces murder charges after the 64-year-old man hes accused of brutally beating in a road-rage assault died from his injuries on Oct. 31, WOOD reported.\u000aProsecutors enhanced the charges against Christian William Hillman on Nov. 1 to include second-degree murder. He had originally been charged with assault with intent to commit great bodily harm. Hes also accused of being under the influence of marijuana at the time of his arrest.\u000aWilliam McFarlan was found lying on a Caledonia Township road with multiple face and rib fractures and bleeding on the brain, probable cause documents stated. One witness claimed to have seen Hillman kick a helpless McFarlan several times and then use an obscene taunt.\u000aHillman told deputies he acted in self-defense after McFarlan grabbed his neck, according to the probable cause document. Hillman said he had to make sure [McFarlan] was completely immobilize so he didnt hurt (him). Police said Hillman claimed to be an ex-heavyweight boxer and admitted he lost his [expletive].\u000aOne witness told police he arrived at the scene when the assault had concluded and Hillman asked him to take a picture of his bloody hands.

VGhost in the Shell released a new teaser starring Scarlett Johansson on Monday.\u000aThe preview sees the 31-year-old actress wear The Major's iconic thermoptic suit, which allows her to land a powerful punch while invisible.\u000aGhost in the Shell is based on the manga of the same name by Japanese artist Masamune Shirow. The series follows a cyborg policewoman, known as "The Major" in the film, as she and her task force fight cyber crime.\u000aSnow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders is helming the Paramount Pictures adaptation. The movie co-stars Pilou Asbek as Batou, with Michael Pitt as Kuze and Takeshi Kitano as Chief Daisuke Aramaki.\u000aThe Ghost in the Shell manga debuted in 1989, and inspired several animated movies and a television series. Fans were curious how The Major's suit would be depicted in the new film, as it makes her appear nude in the 1995 movie.\u000a"We're not actually trying to pretend she's naked," producer Avi Arad told IGN last week. "The suit emulates some of the ideas of the panel lines. When you see it in the movie you're not meant to think that she's naked."\u000aGhost in the Shell opens in theaters March 31, 2017. Johansson is also slated for Rock That Body with Kate McKinnon and Zoe Kravitz, and will reprise Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War.

VRepublican Donald Trump has won the 2016 presidential election by defeating his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, though the exact margins of his electoral victory are still being calculated. To do this, Trump did what most of the professional pundits and so-called smart people thought was impossible: He defied polls to sweep Florida and nearly every battleground state.\u000aTo win the presidential election, Trump drew support from white men and created a new electoral map in the Midwest. Early exit polls indicate he also won over Reagan Democrats and independents.\u000aWhat started as a right-wing populist brushfire at the beginning of the 2016 presidential season seems to have grown into an all out conflagration. Trump, the racist fascist is in control of the presidency; the House and Senate are also controlled by the Republican Party; Americas government is now unified with Trump, the child king, and his attendant the Christian theocrat Michael Pence as the public faces of America. This is a national embarrassment as America is now revealed to be a mockery before the world.\u000aIn a Salon piece earlier this week, I used the analogy of visiting the surgeon and being given a 30 percent chance of survival as the best way to understand the threat to Clinton (and American democracy) represented by Trump. Consider: If a doctor gives a person a 30 percent chance of survival he or she had best make sure the last will and testament is in proper order. It would seem that my worries were prescient and well-considered.\u000aLike documentary filmmaker and activist Michael Moore, I sounded the alarm  for more than a year  about the real possibility of Trumps winning the White House for more than a year. Unfortunately, such warnings were not taken seriously and now we, the American people, are at one of the greatest nadirs in modern American political history.\u000aHow did this happen? I offer the following preliminary explanations:\u000aRacism and sexism combined to defeat Clinton. This outcome is as much a backlash against President Barack Obama as it is against a woman being elected to the top office of the United States of America. America is a country divided against itself where political ideology and polarization are deeply intertwined with racial animus, sexism and hostility to the Other. If politics is a story of action and reaction, the age of Obama was punched in the face on Election Day by the age of Trump.\u000aAuthoritarianism has been on the rise in American over the last 10 years. This is especially 1 among Republicans and right-leaning independents.\u000aConsumed by an obsession with economic insecurity among working-class white voters (a conclusion not borne out by public opinion and other data), the mainstream corporate news media refused to seriously consider the well-documented role of white racism and white racial resentment in motivating Republicans and others who flocked to Trumps banner.\u000aThe level of support for Trump was not captured by public opinion polls. Moreover, his silent majority of white voters may have  in a Republican Trump version of the Bradley effect  told pollsters that they were not voting at all or perhaps even voting for Clinton and then decided to actually support Trump.\u000aUndecided voters, many of them low information individuals lacking a serious grasp of the issues, were drawn to Trump because of celebrity culture, white identity politics, a general sense of malaise and dissatisfaction about the countrys direction and the high negatives associated with Clinton.\u000aThe American corporate news media enabled Trumps ascendance because his antics and unpredictability generated hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue. The corporate news media was also wholly unprepared to deal with a presidential candidate who is a performance artist that channeled the sensibilities of professional wrestling and P. T. Barnum with an utter and total disregard for the truth.\u000aThe elite media, pundits and Washington insiders are also extremely disconnected from the angst and anger of red state America and those other parts of the country that feel left behind by cosmopolitanism and globalization and feel offended by conventions of human decency and respect such as political correctness..\u000aTrumps racism, sexism, misogyny and bigotry are the Republican Party. Such behavior by Trump did little harm to him with his voters.\u000aHe is also anti-intellectual and proudly ignorant. These are attitudes and values encouraged and rewarded by the right-wing news-disinformation media and the political religion that is contemporary conservatism in America.\u000aAs I wrote earlier, the legendary comedian George Carlin was correct. As he famously said about America and politicians, the latter are reflections of the people. Shorter version: Bullshit in, bullshit out. Trump is America.\u000aUltimately, the overwhelming power of white rage is the connective tissue tying together all of the various reasons that Trump defeated Clinton to win the White House. This is an old story in America, a nation founded on white (male) supremacy. Trumps victory is in many ways a return to form that shows the age of Obama, the civil rights movement, and, yes, the womens rights movements, were aberrations in the countrys history.\u000aRacism and white privilege are threats to American democracy. This fact was proven 1 once again as tens of millions of white Americans were willing to elect an incompetent, crude, misogynist, ignorant sexual predator and fascist to the most powerful position in the world in order to Make America Great Again. Again, Trump may not be the president the American people need but he most certainly is the one they deserve.

VWhat we know for sure about the new Chinese J-20 stealth fighter jet is subject to some debate. We know that, according to claims within the Chinese government, that it was designed to compete directly with the latest in American fighter jet technology: the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Outwardly, its appearance resembles that of the F-22. Internally, the latest advances in Chinese air-combat technology are supposed to make it a formidable opponent for the best of the Wests fighter aircraft. Thats assuming you believe Chinas claims. They are, of course, the same nation that produces the Geely GE, which looks exactly like a Rolls Royce on the outside\u000abut rides like the $30,000 platform its built on.\u000aThe Chinese have a long and illustrious history of using spies to skip the research and development phase when developing new technologies, so I cant help but use a critical eye when reading Chinas claims of total air superiority. In July of this year, a U.S. District Judge in Los Angeles sentenced a Chinese spy named Su Bin to 46 months in jail for his hand in a hacker led, Chinese spy ring that included, you guessed it, plans for the F-22 and F-35 platforms.\u000aRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group, believes the new J-20 to be a direct rip off of the F-22 in a number of ways, but with one glaring exception: its just not as good, particularly in the stealth department. The glaring difference between the J-20 and the F-22 are the front canards, which are similar to the elevator surfaces usually found on the tail of an aircraft. These surfaces, while making the jet aesthetically different than the American fighter, also severely inhibit the planes stealth capabilities.\u000aThe Chinese may have had the blueprints for our planes, but they lacked the thorough understanding of stealth technology and the methods that need to be utilized in order to reduce a radar signature from all directions. Based on the design of the craft, Aboulafia suggests that the J-20 would only be stealth from the front, but would otherwise be detectable due to how the radar waves would bounce off of planes angled surfaces. In head-to-head combat, the J-20 would lose in seconds, Aboulafia went on to claim.\u000aTo add insult to knock-off injury, China also has another next generation fighter in production: the J-31, itself a direct aesthetic copy of the F-35. Of course, based on current issues with the original F-35, it might be in Chinas best interest to wait it out and steal another copy of the Joint Strike Fighters plans once we can keep them in the air.\u000aThe United States may not need to be too concerned about Chinas new plane, but other nations in the region may. Although the J-20 doesnt seem to be a technological match for the US, nations like Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam are all generations behind Chinas counterfeit-fighter, giving the Peoples Republic a distinct advantage in any skirmish that could develop in the area. It is also likely that China will make the J-20 available for sale to its allies in Asia and the Middle East.\u000aIf China decides to mass produce the J-20, as they tend to with military aircraft they hope to utilize as well as sell, it could cause issues for the U.S. and allied defenses worldwide. A single J-20 may be no match for our F-22, but ten J-20s would certainly pose a threat. Because Chinas production methods are less expensive, and they were able to skip over the costly research phase, China could easily out-produce the United States in terms of fifth generation fighters.\u000aJustin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, believes the mass production of J-20s could spell trouble in the future, They might not be a matchup one-on-one with the F-35 but they may well be able to put far more of them in the sky in the next few years.\u000aChina may not have beat the U.S. with their copy-cat plane, but that doesnt mean the new fighter doesnt dramatically increase Chinas tactical capabilities. The fighter will provide China with longer range strike capabilities with far larger weapon payloads than ever before available to the communist nation.\u000aThe J-20 likely wont go into mass production until 2018, and until we get a better look at the craft and what its capable of, most analysts agree that the best we can do is speculate. One thing is certain, however, regardless of where China got the plans, they just took a major leap in offensive capability. With a number of ongoing territorial disputes with U.S. allied nations in the South China sea, the unveiling of this new fighter must be seen as a bit of indignant posturing toward an already tense region.\u000aImages courtesy of the Associated Press and AutoHome\u000a All of our content is FREE until December 25th, when we will go back to require a subscription to SOFREP.com.

VPresident Obama was gracious enough to invite President-elect Donald Trump to the White House to give him a few pointers and show the American people how great our democracy is where new leadership seamlessly transitions into power without interruption. Many U.S. citizens are unhappy with the election results and one of them is currently the President of the United States. \u000aTrump questioning the legitimacy of Obamas for eight years and the 44th and 45th President of the United States have bickered against each other. \u000aTrump tweeted out: President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States.\u000aThe POTUS responded by saying, Well Donald Trump, at least I will go down as a president.\u000aThat jab seems much less harsh after Trump won the election against Hillary Clinton who Obama and his wife Michelle were campaigning for. \u000aBut that is all water under the bridge now and the two came together for the sake of this great countrys future. While the meeting was cordial, you know these two men hate each other and it was awkward as fuck. Reddit took the liberty of having a photoshop battle of Obama and Trump shaking hands at their frosty meeting and the results are impressive to say the least. \u000aVia Reddit

VKeke Palmer is showing her 1 self in her full visual EP for her project Lauren, premiering exclusively on Billboard.\u000aThe 23-year-old singer recently opened up about why she named the five-track EP after her birth name.\u000a"Because I feel like it helps keep in mind what this whole EP is about, which is giving an entrance into who I am truly, like where I come from, how my career as Keke Palmer began," she told Billboard. \u000a"Keke, of course, is a family nickname," she added. "Everything attached to it - being my entertainment name, I feel like are often so separate from the totality of who I am because so much of my early career was based off of acting and my characters. Of course, I'm not my characters and so for my EP, I felt like because this is them getting to see it through the 1 me, where I'm coming from and how I'm feeling, I feel like it was perfect to title it my birth name Lauren."\u000aThe EP also features Lil Yachty and Dreezy.\u000aListen to Keke  touch on relationship troubles, vulnerability, and tons more emotions below.

VThe early vote and polls in Nevada continue to disagree. The polls suggest a tight race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Democrats, thanks in large part to high turnout on the last day of early voting on Friday, have built a large lead in early voting in the state. But what exactly does Clintons early-vote advantage in Nevada tell us? And if Clinton does win the state, how does it affect her chances in the Electoral College overall?\u000aDemocrats are up 6 percentage points among early voters. That is, of everyone who has voted early so far in the Silver State, there are 6 points more registered Democrats than Republicans. Thats huge because most voters in Nevada vote early. In 2012, about 70 percent of all votes in the state were cast early. Thats why the party registration breakdown of early voters generally matches the registration of all people who eventually cast a ballot in the state. (Its also what makes early voting a more reliable indicator of the final vote in Nevada, unlike in most other states.)\u000aIf Clinton and Trump win an equal share of their respective partys voters, it will be difficult for Trump to win the state.\u000aStill, we should be careful. The early vote numbers dont guarantee the polls are wrong. Being a registered Democrat doesnt necessarily mean youre going to vote for Clinton. If Trump is winning more registered Democrats than Clinton is registered Republicans, the early vote data in Nevada may not mean what we think it means. Indeed, some Nevada polls (though not all) show Trump getting a higher percentage of self-identified Democrats than Clinton gets Republicans. Its also possible that Republicans turnout in disproportionately strong numbers on Election Day, despite previous trends.\u000aBut lets say the polls are wrong in Nevada, and, as Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston put it, Trump needs a miracle in Vegas on Election Day  and a Buffalo Bills Super Bowl championship is more likely to win the state. How much of a difference would that make to Clintons chances of winning the White House?\u000aWell, it depends on whether the polls are underestimating Clinton only in Nevada or whether theres a more systemic problem. Lets say the error in Nevada was more specific to Nevada (i.e., because pollsters there have a tough time reaching Latino voters). In 2010, for instance, most pre-election surveys underestimated how well Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was going to do. Even as Reid won re-election, many Democrats nationwide lost. If the error is only in Nevada, it helps Clinton but not by much. In 2.6 percent of our models simulations, Nevada goes to Trump and Clinton loses the Electoral College but would have won it if she had won Nevada. So if we give Clinton Nevada, her chances of winning the Electoral College increase from 65.5 percent to 68.1 percent. Thats not nothing, but its not much, either.\u000aEven if Nevada isnt a sign that the polls are underestimating her everywhere, a Clinton win in the Silver State does keep an important path open for her. Previously, Clintons firewall (i.e., where she was strongest in the polls) looked like this:\u000aThis map allows Clinton to win without Florida or North Carolina, where the polls are close. Trump, however, has managed to narrow the margin in New Hampshire to a few percentage points. Without New Hampshire and its four electoral votes, Clinton falls back below 270 electoral votes on this map. Clinton can, though, substitute in Nevada and its six electoral votes for New Hampshire.\u000aIn all the blue states above besides Nevada, Clinton holds a lead of at least 3 percentage points in the polls. Remember, though, its possible that the polls could be off by that much in a relatively close state such as Michigan or Pennsylvania in the other direction.\u000aThats why a polling miss in Nevada is far more significant if it means the polls are off in other states in the same direction. In 2012, the polls underestimated Obama in Nevada and all over the map. That led to an easy Obama victory, despite pre-election polls pointing to a close race. In the FiveThirtyEight polls-only forecast, which assumes that if one states polls miss then a polling error in that direction is more likely to occur in other states too, Clinton wins 88 percent of the time with a victory in Nevada. Thats obviously a big difference and why the early vote numbers coming out of Nevada could mean a lot.\u000aFor now, though, we dont really know what the early vote in Nevada portends for Clinton nationally. Its certainly not evidence that this election is over. It is, however, a potentially good sign for Clinton.

VMike MarslandMike Marsland/WireImage\u000aKendall Jenner found a clever way to #freethenipple on Instagram. \u000aThe model covered her nipples with pizza emojis in an Instagram posted on Saturday as a way to get around the social media platforms much-scrutinized community guidelines, which ban nudity. In the past, the platform has removed semi-nude photos posted by Rihanna, Chelsea Handler and Miley Cyrus. \u000a zaza\u000aA photo posted by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Nov 5, 2016 at 8:45pm PDT\u000aInstagram has faced frequent criticism for its handling of explicit photos on the service. After the platform received heat for removing a number of photos showing mothers breastfeeding or breast cancer survivors showing their mastectomy scars, Instagram revamped its policies in April 2015 to explicitly exempt those photos from its nudity policy. Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom said at an event in October 2015 that the apps controversial policy was mandated by Apple, which bans nudity on apps with ratings under 17+.\u000aBut some women arent happy with that reasoning, and argue that taking down photos of nipples suggests that female breasts are shameful. Free the Nipple, a movement sparked by a 2012 documentary by director Lina Esco, has fought to allow women to bare their breasts  in public and on social media. Women have staged topless protests, filed lawsuits against states nudity laws and complained to social networking platforms about strict nudity guidelines. Why can you show public beheadings from Saudi Arabia on Facebook, but not a nipple? Why can you sell guns on Instagram, but yet they will suspend your account for posting the most natural part of a womans body? Esco wrote in a blog post in 2013. \u000aAnd Jenner, who has posted a number of semi-nude photos on her social media platforms before, clearly agrees.\u000aI really dont see what the big deal is with going braless, Jenner wrote in a blog post on her website earlier this year. Its sexy, its comfortable, and Im cool with my breasts. Thats it!

VComing off a championship season, the Cavs have come out on fire and currently sit at 5-0.\u000aCLEVELAND  It was more a prophecy than a prediction, but Cleveland Cavaliers coach Ty Lue has an obvious sense of what LeBron James is trying to do this year.\u000aEven with a chance to enter the NBAs top-10 all-time scoring list on Thursday night, James opted to set up his teammates and push the milestone to another day. He finished with 30 points, one shy of Hakeem Olajuwons 26,946 career total, and 12 assists.\u000aLeBron James (23) looks on during the second half of a game against the Orlando Magic at Quicken ...more LeBron James (23) looks on during the second half of a game against the Orlando Magic at Quicken Loans Arena.\u000aIts always humbling when youre able to put yourself in any category with the guys that laid the path for you, James said. Its pretty cool.\u000aBut initiating the Cavs offense, not passing a legend, was on the agenda for Thursday.\u000aThats what LeBrons been doing this season, Lue said ahead of his teams 128-122 victory over the Boston Celtics that pushed the Cavs to 5-0. Not really forcing the issue offensively. We know LeBron can score the basketball, but to start the season hes been a great facilitator for us. He can also score the basketball on any given night. Youll probably see that also coming up.\u000aJames followed Lues directive at Bostons expense. He stretched the Celtics defense with eight first-half assists, including six that directly led to three-pointers. It was part of a Cavs three-point assault that shot 61% (11 for 18) from the three-point line in the first half. Kevin Love, Channing Frye and Iman Shumpert were the primary beneficiaries, though his pocket-pass to Tristan Thompson set up a poster dunk over Celtic center and former Cavalier Tyler Zeller.\u000aIts just the way I read and react to the game, James said. I did a great job in the first half of setting up my guys. Once I started to do that, a couple lanes opened up for me.\u000aAt the start of the third quarter, James shook his defenders like Olajuwon once did as scoring became his focus. He reeled off 12 consecutive points as the Cavs lead grew to 80-63. The two loudest came on an alley-oop lob off the backboard courtesy of Kyrie Irving. James finished with 20 in the third and Olajuwons mark became more realistic.\u000aHe says he didnt know, Irving said. I brought it up to him in the locker room in saying that he needed two points. He said I didnt know. Yeah, he knew. He knows everything.\u000aSitting on 30 points, James ultimately passed on several chances to reach the mark late in the fourth quarter C an achievement that will surely come Saturday against the Philadelphia 76ers. But whats more telling are James priorities. Hes always appreciated passing more than scoring, but Irving, who had 23 points, and Love, who had 26, are good enough to assume more of the scoring burden than last year. Whats more, James is willing to defer.\u000aJames has always led his team in that category throughout his entire career, but Irving is currently averaging almost six more points per game (26.8) on six more shot attempts (20.5). It might be the beginning of a new phase of James career arc and one that unlocks more triple-doubles throughout the season. Hes not far off the triple-double average right now at 22.4 points, 10.0 assists and 9.0 rebounds per game.\u000aI never thought it would be possible after obviously (Oscar Robertson) did it. You see in the game today, you see guys like Russ (Westbrook), what hes doing every night. Ive come close a few times, James said. Ive always told you guys I want to be a triple-threat for my team every night, and thats scoring, rebounding and definitely getting my guys involved, James said. If it results in (triple-doubles) then Im fine with that.

VFew prognosticators predicted a Donald Trump victory ahead of Tuesday night. Polls showed Hillary Clinton comfortably ahead, and much of America (chiefly the media) failed to anticipate the wave of pro-Trump support that propelled him to victory. But a Washington, D.C.-based professor insisted that Trump was lined up for a win  based on the idea that elections are primarily a reflection on the performance of the party in power.\u000aAllan Lichtman uses a historically based system of what he calls keys to predict election results ahead of time. The keys are explained in-depth in Lichtmans book Predicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House 2016. In our conversations in September and October, he outlined how President Obama's second term set the Democrats up for a tight race, and his keys tipped the balance in Trump's favor, even if just barely.\u000aAt the end of our September conversation, Lichtman made another call: That if elected, Trump would eventually be impeached by a Republican Congress that would prefer a President Mike Pence  someone who establishment Republicans know and trust.\u000aI'm going to make another prediction, he said. This one is not based on a system, it's just my gut. They don't want Trump as president, because they can't control him. He's unpredictable. They'd love to have Pence  an absolutely down the line, conservative, controllable Republican. And I'm quite certain Trump will give someone grounds for impeachment, either by doing something that endangers national security or because it helps his pocketbook.\u000aSo while Republican voters clearly came home before Nov. 8  network exit polls show 90 percent of GOP voters cast ballots for Trump  it's less clear that the party leadership is on board. (Lichtman actually isn't the only person to predict a Trump impeachment; this morning, the New York Times's David Brooks suggested a Trump impeachment or resignation was probably in the cards sometime within the next year.)\u000aIt's worth noting that Lichtman's predictions use very different methods than pollsters and data-based prognosticators. Some statisticians take issue with the structure of his system, a set of 13 1/0 questions, saying that the binary nature of his keys leads to what's called overfitting, which is basically creating a system that fits the data but has little statistical significance. But Lichtman counters by saying that the system has correctly predicted every election since 1984 (specifically, his predictions have picked the next president correctly in all of those elections but 2000, when he picked Al Gore, who won the popular vote). And Lichtman has his own criticism for data-based predictions.\u000aPolls are not predictors, he said Friday in an email. They are snapshots that simulate an election. They are abused and misused as predictors. Even the analysis of polls by Nate Silver and others which claimed a probable Clinton victory with from more than 70 percent to 99 percent certainty are mere compilations that are no better than the underlying polls.\u000aAnd he has particular disdain for prediction systems that assign a likelihood of winning.\u000aFor all his acclaim, Nate Silver is only a clerk, not a scientific analyst, Lichtman said.\u000aAs for the real reason for Trump's win, Lichtman says the blame can't be put on Hillary Clinton or her campaign  rather, he says, it was decided by the larger forces that shape American politics.\u000aThe Democrats cannot rebuild by pointing fingers at Hillary Clinton and her campaign, which as the Keys demonstrated, were not the root cause of her defeat, he said. The Democrats can rehabilitate themselves only by offering an inspiring progressive alternative to Republican policies and building a grass-roots movement.

Or more accurately, that time Solange freaked out on Jay Z in an elevator after the Met Gala in 2014 while Beyonc stood idly by? Of course you do, because that was a next-level display of celebrity anger. And though they wound up releasing a statement  and there has been much speculation on the topic  well never know for sure what that elevator fight was all about.\u000aMore: Did Jay Z really cheat on Beyonc, or is Lemonade just a piece of art?\u000aImage: Instagram/TMZ\u000aSo when Beys mom, Tina Knowles, posted a shot of Solange and Jay Z chilling in an elevator yesterday with Solanges son Julez and her husband Alan Ferguson, you'd better believe people took notice. And though she must have realized the implications and deleted it posthaste, TMZ got a screenshot of the image for posterity, and it will now live on forever, thanks to the internet.\u000aFrom two years ago until at least next century, any elevator-associated image in relation to Bey, Jay and/or Solange is automatically going to trigger memories of that fateful night. Though some speculated that Solange went wild because Jay Z was cheating, well never know for sure. When Beyoncs Lemonade came out and some lyrics suggested that such infidelity indeed occurred  He only want me when I'm not there / He better call Becky with the good hair, Bey sang  the Beyhive (the singers legion of fans) went nuts. But from the source, we only got that very vanilla statement.\u000aMore: Beyonc, Jay Z \u005cu0026 Solange speak out on that elevator ride\u000aAs they put it in 2014, There has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident, the statement read. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.\u000aImage: Getty Images\u000aThe statement tried to paint Bey, Jay and Solange as an average fam, adding, At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same. Indeed. And so it was, until Beyoncs mother had to go and post a shot of everyone hanging out in an elevator. Oops.\u000aMore: Beyonc's elevator explanation in "Flawless" remix is confusing

VAfter the death of my son, I wrote an article about The dos and donts when expressing sympathy to a parent who lost a child. I saw how uncomfortable people were, how they were a loss for words, and I offered suggestions to families and friends offering condolences.\u000aTraveling this unthinkable road I have found the same awkward and oftentimes hurtful behavior that is connected to suicide. Society attaches a stigma to suicide. Survivors of suicide loss may encounter blame, judgment or social exclusion, while mourners of loved ones who have died from terminal illness, accident, old age or other kinds of deaths usually receive sympathy and compassion.\u000aThe stigma overlooks the way my son lived, the bright, witty, gentle, loving young man he was, and focuses instead on his death. When someone suffering from cancer dies, we dont reduce the person to the details of their death. We think of and remember the person, who they were, what they did in their lifetime, how they will be missed.\u000aI could have been part of this group as well until my son took his own life.\u000aMy son suffered from schizophrenia and I would randomly be asked if he committed suicide. That is terribly hurtful and painful to the survivors of suicide. I was initially taken aback at the insensitivity. But when this occurred several times I realized it was less of an insensitivity issue and more of a curiosity, a fascination about the act itself, and a lack of understanding that a neurobiological illness is no different than cancer, diabetes, etc.\u000aThere is a captivation to suicide we choose not to admit. It scares us and fascinates us at the same time. We wonder what they were thinking during the minutes and hours before taking their life. Whether this is an act of bravery or cowardice on their part? If there is a part inside of us that has at times in our own lives can relate to this act?\u000aWe tend to label the person as selfish, maybe crazy. We think they took the easy way out.\u000aWell let me tell you, its almost always none of these. The primary goal of a suicide is not to end life, but to end pain.\u000aMy son was unable to hold onto any semblance of pain going away. While some may argue that a person who dies by suicide has done so by their own choice, in many cases serious mental illness limits choice, and this debilitation is recognized by Jewish law. My son was the bravest person I knew. He, like so many others, went to battle every day, every night, for 15 years.\u000aMy son, and I know I am speaking for hundreds of others, tried for years to have a normal life, with normal jobs, friends, everything most of us take for granted. But those who struggle with mental health issues dont take anything for granted. If they have one hour of peace, one hour of productive work, one hour of a meaningful relationship, they are grateful. And year after year, month after month, day after day of dealing with horrendous demons does not make them selfish or crazy.\u000aTheir intense pain blinds them from seeing the possibility of a peaceful life in their future. Had he lived perhaps in 20 years there might have been a cure.\u000aI am by no means an advocate of taking ones life. What I am an advocate of and will fight ferociously for is to erase the stigma connected to suicide so our loved ones will be given the respect they deserve, and the survivors will never feel ashamed, isolated or Judged.\u000a Judaism views suicide as a sin. But the suicide of someone suffering from serious mental illness is more akin to a death by a disease. \u000aFor some who have been blessed not to have any mental health issues in their lives (it affects one family member in five) schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression unfortunately seem to define the individual. We say this person is schizophrenic, is bipolar, is depressed. We never say, Janet is cancer. Yes, its an issue of semantics, but I think it also conveys so much more. Our loved ones who suffer from a mental illness must not be defined by their illness or their death.\u000aJudaism views suicide as a sin. Life is a precious gift bestowed by God. It is not ours to treat cavalierly. But the suicide of someone suffering from serious mental illness is more akin to a death by a disease, which it is. Under these horrific circumstances, the taking of ones life is not entirely ones volition. Recognizing this gives much comfort to the families.\u000aIn the United States, someone dies by suicide every 13 minutes, and each death intimately affects at least six others, according to the American Association of Suicidology. Those who are directly affected include immediate family members, relatives, neighbors, friends, fellow students and/or co-workers.\u000aI spoke with my heart at my sons funeral about his life and struggles, explaining what we and others face when dealing with mental health issues, particularly schizophrenia. I felt Jake was there with me, and I was speaking through him.\u000aIn the days thereafter as friends and family came to offer their condolences and support, the outpouring of thanks for sharing my story was overwhelming. If there was any comfort to be found, it was from these expressions of gratitude and knowing a new light was shed to help others.\u000aThe opinions expressed in the comment section are the personal views of the commenters.

VA top aide to President-elect Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton should not blame her failed White House run on FBI Director James Comey.\u000aI think its unfortunate for [former] Secretary [of State] Clinton, who is a woman of enormous gifts and talents, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on NBCs Meet the Press Sunday.\u000a And she should be commended for putting herself out there and running for president twice, Conway added. \u000aI just cant believe its always somebody elses fault. Sometimes you just have to take a look in the mirror and reflect on what went wrong.\u000aConway added that Clintons campaign simply missed the desires of voters.\u000aWhat about the fact that they just got it wrong? she asked of Clintons bid. "What about the fact they werent in touch with Americans, and the culture zeitgeist, and what motivates many Americans?\u000aThey misread America. They did not have her in red states. They were pretending they were going to turn red blue. They were pretending.\u000aClinton, the Democratic nominee, on Saturday blamed her electoral defeat on Comey during a call with her campaigns top donors. \u000a[O]ur analysis is that Comeys letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum, she said.\u000aComey sent Congress a letter 11 days before Election Day informing lawmakers the FBI had renewed its probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State after discovering more emails potentially related to the case on the computer of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

VWas President Obama Our Coolest Prez Ever \u000aThose who were disappointed in the presidential elections outcome still found some value in Van Jones as one of the nights MVPs. He first lent a voice to anyone whos terrified by a Trump presidency. He then coolly fended off a persistent Corey Lewandowski, who demanded that Clinton make a 2:00am concession speech. He continued to appear on CNN throughout Wednesday, but of particular note was this clash with Trump surrogate Kayleigh McEnany, which saw Jones finally raise his voice: Im not going to be talked over tonight!\u000aJones is particularly adept at staying calm and collected when other people get shout-y. Yet this time, the surrogate in question refused to empathize with anyone who doesnt subscribe to her version of reality. McEnany claimed to want unity but acted clueless on why minorities and women are driven to protest a Trump victory throughout the country. Jones explained how Trumps promise to deport Muslims lands like a bomb in their lap.

VThe Alien base which were discovered on lunar surface\u000aAn alien megastructure has been discovered on Tycho Crater which appears to be a massive base of the UFO's.\u000aThis recent footage looks like a lunar formation that appears to be one of the types of lunar structures which was already mentioned before by Scott Waring, a well-known UFO expert and hunter.\u000aAs reported on UFO Sightings Daily, these types of structures that Waring has been mentioning before are the white ceramic structures, which are medium in size and they have 90-degree angles. The other one is the black structures which have curved edges and they are as big as the mountains.\u000a These black structures, according to Waring, are biochemically grown and these produce another type of alien lunar structures or what is now termed as the alien megastructures. These are described as small grey metallic structures and they are the result of the biochemical process as per Morning News USA.\u000aAnd the recent footage of alien megastructures is white in color and they feature corners and straight edges. And that these UFO experts are clueless why the astronauts did not even report having seen these structures on the lunar surface.\u000aBecause of these alien megastructures which are found on Tycho Crater, UFO experts and hunters predict that a space war might happen in the near future. It seems like the aliens are already building their bases on the surface of the moon.\u000aHowever, some people started to doubt on these alien megastructures since it seems like it is filmed in a hidden studio which was constructed to make it look like a lunar surface.\u000aNASA will still have to give their comments and verifications on this matter and findings of the UFO hunters as the US was unable to send a second manned mission on the moon because that feat is impossible at that time.\u000aIf these alien megastructures which are discovered on Tycho Crater are proofs of alien bases on our neighbor, would this mean that people need to start doing some precautionary measures for the impending alien invasion and space war?

VCelebrity News \u000aKendall Jenner reportedly ditched Blac Chynas baby birth earlier this week, but from what insiders have gathered, the model had a good explanation as to why she was absent.\u000aPrior to Blacs decision to check into the hospital earlier than expected, the family had been told that Rob and Chynas daughter, Dream, would not be arriving until the third week of November.\u000aAs one would expect, the Kardashians have quite a busy schedule  especially Kendall Jenner, who has been traveling the world to model for the likes of Karl Lagerfeld and Marc Jacobs in recent months.\u000aHow Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid Bring Off-Duty Style to the Court https://t.co/FpGD0H0xYy pic.twitter.com/w4XKczDh3b\u000a ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) November 13, 2016\u000aSo it didnt come as a shocker for the family to hear that Blac had checked into a nearby hospital earlier than expected, TIME adds. Too bad for Kendall, though, because the model was already booked for her modeling gigs out of the country, evidently leaving her with no other option but to skip the joyful occasion.\u000aKendall has been super busy with work and that is the reason she has not been able to visit her new niece Dream, a source gushed to Hollywood Life. Kendall had a modeling job the day Dream was born and she is going to have to go out of town again now for more work.\u000aShe didnt think the baby was due until the middle of the month when she put she schedule together, and cant cancel these big jobs, it just is not professional. But Kendall sent flowers and Facetimed with Rob \u005cu0026 Blac to congratulate them and meet baby Dream virtually.\u000aAccording to the outlet, there was no bad blood between Chyna and Kendall Jenner  everyone understood that certain family members had things booked in advance, with nobody expecting the baby to arrive two weeks earlier from the actual due date.\u000aKendall Jenner bares (almost) all for her hot new lingerie campaign  see the pics! https://t.co/WIJCICf5hF pic.twitter.com/vIMLqR04j5\u000a EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) November 13, 2016\u000aEven Khloe Kardashian was stunned to learn that Rob Kardashians daughter had been born. The reality star was in Cleveland when she heard the news that Blac was gearing up to welcome Dream Kardashian into the world, leaving Khloe with no other option but to take the next flight back to Los Angeles.\u000aWhile Kendall Jenner was out of the country, Kris rushed to Blac Chynas bedside to show her support for the former stripper and her son. Back in Calabasas, Kylie Jenner decided to skip the delivery room stay and opted to babysit Chynas four-year-old son, King Cairo, instead.\u000aAll in all, it seems as if the Kardashians have finally bonded with Blac Chyna well enough to accept the fact that she wont be going anywhere anytime soon, as previously mentioned by another source.\u000aKendall Jenner and her siblings were said to have been on the edge after learning about Rob Kardashians relationship with the socialite, who had been feuding with Kylie on social media prior to the romance confirmation.\u000aBlac was furious that Kylie had stolen Tyga from her and effectively sought for her revenge. And while the family, including Kendall Jenner, werent accepting the relationship at first, after learning about Blacs pregnancy announcement, the family had no other choice but to put their differences aside for the sake of the baby.\u000aTwice as nice! Kendall Jenner wears double denim for a casual lunch https://t.co/StpxAcGvnj pic.twitter.com/e0kTpKHeuS\u000a Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) November 10, 2016\u000aDo you think Kendall Jenners reasons for missing Blac Chynas baby birth is valid and genuine? Or do you think she purposely kept herself busy for the entire month so that she didnt have to show her support for the couple by showing up to the hospital?\u000aAfter all, its not uncommon for babies to be delivered weeks ahead of their actual due date.

VEver since the start of the campaign, one of Donald Trumps promises was to jail Hillary Clinton for her many crimes. For many Americans, this was enough for them to vote Republican when election day came but now that the billionaire businessman is the new President of the United States, does he intend to make good on that promise?\u000aBefore Trump made a bid for the highest office in the land, he has been an avid donor to Democratic politicians, including the woman he would eventually run against. This was something the Clinton Campaign and even fellow Republicans made use of to discredit Trump.\u000aIn last months debate, Donald Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to examine the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton and her staff. He ended his remarks that the former State Department Secretary will face jail time if he becomes president.\u000aAccording to the Washington Post, in a mere two months, he will have the power to potentially make that a reality. Of course, it would be much more complicated than simply saying youre fired as he so often did on his show The Apprentice.\u000aBarack Obama To Pardon Clinton?\u000aFor starters, he would have to appoint his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor for the case. After which, he would have to count on that special prosecutor to agree with his assessment that Clintons actions violated criminal laws about mishandling top secret information.\u000aNot only that, but his predecessor could delay what would have been an inevitable jail time with a simple stroke of a pen. Yes, according to Politico, President Barack Obama could pardon Clinton mainly because her alleged illegal actions occurred during his time in office.\u000aHowever, this would forever tarnish his reputation for siding with someone the majority of the American people believe to be a liar and a murderer. Do you believe Donald Trump will put Hillary Clinton behind bars? Let us know what you think in the comments below.\u000a Liked this story?

VBy George Pimentel/Getty Image.\u000aRobert Redford is channeling his inner Joan Didion. In a recent interview, the 80-year-old artist said he's ready to bid adieu to the acting world, following a pair of upcoming films. \u000aIve got two acting projects in the works, Redford said in a recent interview with grandson Dylan for the Walker Arts Center. Once theyre done, then Im going to say, O.K., thats goodbye to all that, and then just focus on directing.\u000aRedford has appeared consistently on big screens over the years, including recent, high-profile fare like Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Petes Dragon. He also generated heavy awards-show buzz for his starring role in the 2013 seafaring drama All Is Lost, though he ultimately was not nominated for an Oscar. Many viewed that as a snub, considering the rave reviews garnered by his performanceand the fact that Redford was on-screen alone for the entirety of the movie. \u000aThough he already has two Oscarsone honorary and one for his debut directorial feature, Ordinary PeopleRedford has not won a competitive statuette for his acting. He has not even been nominated for his acting work since The Sting in 1974. It's possible that one of his last two movies will give the veteran a chance to pick up an acting awardespecially since the Academy does love to reward veterans. \u000aIn the interview, Redford discussed the final acting projects he's currently working on: Our Souls at Night, with Jane Fonda, a love story for older people who get a second chance in life, and Old Man with a Gun, a lighter piece with Casey Affleck and Sissy Spacek.\u000aDirecting aside, Dylan also asked his famous grandfather if he's thinking about getting back into painting, a career Redford explored as a teen before getting into acting. Yeah, a lotand a lot lately because Im getting tired of acting," Redford replied. "Im an impatient person, so its hard for me to sit around and do take after take after take. At this point in my life, age 80, itd give me more satisfaction because Im not dependent on anybody. Its just me, just the way it used to be, and so going back to sketchingthats sort of where my head is right now. So, Im thinking of moving in that direction and not acting as much.\u000aEarlier this year, Redford told Vanity Fair that he's been itching to direct a thriller, but not one that is dependent on special effects. Just purely psychological, but will scare the hell out of you. Thats what I would like to do. I have not found it yet.\u000aThe last narrative feature Redford directed was 2012's The Company You Keep, a journalism drama that he also starred in, alongside Shia LaBeouf, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon, Anna Kendrick, and more.

VSponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \u000aWe all live for different things. Some live to be happy, while some live to achieve great heights. While both of these are good, we all need to know that there's only one thing to live for: God Himself.\u000aThe Reason to Live\u000aAll who are in Christ know that there's only one reason to live, and that is for the glory of the risen Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:15 tells us that Christ "died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them."\u000aHe is both the reason why we're alive, and the one we live and die for.\u000aKnowing this, it would be best to avoid these three things so that we could live in obedience to Christ Jesus for the glory of God.\u000a1. Sinful Self-Gratification\u000aThe number one enemy of following Christ and being like Him is none other than the self. Jesus said in Matthew 16:24 that "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me."\u000aWe all need to learn to deny ourselves to be able to follow Him, especially in a generation where men are "lovers of themselves" (see 2 Timothy 3:2). We all need to kill our sinful desires that war against the spirit.\u000a2. A Consuming Desire for Self-Glorification\u000aAnother hindrance to pursuing God is the desire to glorify and lift one's self up high. When we choose to honour and place ourselves in a place higher than the one we give to God, it becomes a problem.\u000aAlthough we often see this in the lives of politicians, celebrities and other people outside the church, this problem isn't limited to them as church-people can and will also be tempted to lift themselves up if they aren't careful. In fact, there are a lot of Christians having this issue in their lives.\u000aWe see pastors promoting themselves more than they do Christ and the Word of God. We see ministries praising themselves for the things they do, at times belittling the grace of God that enabled them to do what they did. Seriously, it's a problem.\u000aKeep in mind what Proverbs 3:34 says: "The Lord mocks the mockers but is gracious to the humble."\u000a3. Unhealthy Self-Preservation\u000aLastly, we should also avoid protecting ourselves too much. I'm not saying we should all be reckless and ignore warnings that safeguard us from harm and certain doom. What I'm saying is that if we try to keep ourselves comfortable and warm and cosy all the time, complete with a very good reputation among all the people, we might end up become people-pleasers who will never dare to do what God says is right.\u000aI'd like to explain too much self-preservation as the act of prioritising one's reputation and comfort way more than pursuing God's will through self-denial, service, facing persecution in sharing the gospel and, and braving against ridicule in doing right. At a time when our faith in God and obedience to His Word is often criticised and insulted, we all need to "set our face like flint" to do the will of God for our lives (see Isaiah 50:7).

VI WAS interested to read Carol Vordermans account of her mothers advice on ageing, which was spookily similar to advice my mother gave me.\u000aMy mother told me that from 50 it was downhill, said Carol, who is 56.\u000aI absolutely dont agree. Im finally living the life Ive always wanted and loving every second. Im living the dream.\u000aCarol dismissed her mothers advice on turning 50\u000aCarol has spent her life and her career pushing boundaries.\u000aShe went to university in the days when not many women did. She also went fearlessly into the male-dominated world of maths and engineering.\u000aInterestingly, one of her motivations was her desire to have a different life to her mother, who was forced to depend on her husband for money.\u000aReach for the sky  Carol trained to become a pilot at the age of 50\u000aCarol said: My mother was very dependent financially on her husband. I didnt want that. Thats been a driving force.\u000aGiven that the latest estimate of Carols worth is ?18million, Im guessing she is relishing every moment of her financial independence.\u000aBut its not just about money. Shes really living the life she wants to live.\u000aShe trained to become a pilot at the age of 50, then quit her regular slot on Loose Women to fly solo around the world.\u000aThe Loose Women host is ready to join celebs in the Aussie jungle\u000aAnd shes just gone into the TV jungle for a reported six-figure fee (but Im guessing shes doing it for the experience rather than the money).\u000aLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Carol is a pretty spectacular role model for any woman over 40  her career is positively flying.\u000aMy mum also told me that women of 50 become suddenly invisible.\u000aAnd the truth is that for her generation, that may well have been the case.\u000aThe glam 56-year-old will appear in Im A Celebrity for a reported six-figure fee\u000aWhen my mother was in her prime, women were valued for their looks  and their youth  above all else.\u000aBut slowly, things have changed. Yes, women are still judged by their appearance.\u000aBut I wont be telling my daughter to expect to slip out of view by the age of 50.\u000aIn fact, in my experience, women in business are usually in their fifties when they get to the top.\u000aFor actresses the invisibility curse used to start even younger, at around 30. But thats changing too.\u000aOnly the other day, Charlize Theron said she actually gets more jobs now shes older.\u000aSo what has changed? The biggest thing is a huge shift in attitude among women. We no longer need men to look at us to feel good about ourselves.\u000aIts not about what men think about us, its what we think about ourselves that matters.\u000aIn Britain today there are more and more examples of women who are in their prime not just at 50 but well beyond  because women are being judged increasingly by how they do the job over whether they look good or not.\u000aTake Mary Berry, who at 81 is the Queen of Telly and respected above all for her experience, her knowledge and professionalism.\u000aThen there is Glenda Jackson, who at the age of 80 is getting rave reviews as King Lear at Londons Old Vic.\u000aTheres also Dame Judi Dench, 81, Dame Maggie Smith, also 81, and Dame Joan Collins, who at 83 is more glamorous than ever.\u000aIn continuing to do what they do so well, these women are nudging the glass ceiling towards breaking, slowly but surely showing the world they are so much more than just a pretty face.\u000aHillary Clinton was often described as looking 'tired' during the elections\u000aSure, youth is still valued and ageism does exist  just look at the coverage of Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump.\u000aThroughout her campaign, Hillary was often referred to as looking tired which, as everyone knows, is code for old.\u000aI dont recall seeing the same word applied to Trump, who is older than Clinton.\u000aBut its important to dwell on the positives, not the negatives. And not to lose hope.\u000aIn her very gracious concession speech, Hillarys regret that she did not shatter the ultimate glass ceiling this time around was eclipsed by a more important message: Someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think.\u000aHer advice in the meantime to women and girls everywhere was to: Never stop believing that fighting for whats right is worth it.\u000aSure, we may not yet have a female President in the US but we all need to keep pushing away at that glass ceiling.\u000aHillarys words are a reminder that there are always ?setbacks, that Rome wasnt built in a day and all of us need to keep pushing our girls, because the world needs more strong women.\u000aMay we know them. May we be them. May we raise them.\u000aHas Carol Vorderman unintentionally revealed she will be on I'm A Celeb?

VRelationships are a tricky bitch. Sometimes when were in them, we do everything in our power to convince ourselves that we should stay in them, even if we know we shouldnt. You will make excuses time and time again to stay in a relationship because you convinced yourself that youre happy when in reality, youre sinking and you dont know what to do.\u000aWell, there are certain things even the most optimistic person cant ignore. If you feel any of these 8 things in your relationship, youre in the wrong relationship:\u000aConstantly feeling disappointed\u000aWhen youre in a relationship, you should be able to count on your partner. If you ask them for something, you should be able to know that they have your back. If you find yourself constantly being let down and riddled with excuses, youre in the wrong relationship. Your significant other shouldnt have you as a second thought, they should think about you all the time. If thats not happening, and if youre happiness isnt a priority, its time to call it quits.\u000aBeing fearful\u000aBeing in a relationship is supposed to being you joy, not fear. You shouldnt have to constantly worry about whether or not your partner is going to do something because theyre upset or stressed out. If youre afraid to have a genuine conversation or even mention something because youre afraid of their reaction, get out now.\u000aAny kind of shame\u000aSome people have no filter, but you shouldnt constantly have to apologize for your partner behavior. When youre with someone, you want to be able to be proud of them, to show them off and smile. If youre in a situation where youre feeling ashamed of your partner because of the way theyre behaving, youre in the wrong relationship.\u000aFeeling alone\u000aCorrect me if Im wrong, but the point of being in a relationship is to be with someone. So no, you should never feel alone or neglected. You shouldnt have to wait up until the middle of the night for them to come home, you shouldnt have to do everything yourself, you shouldnt have to feel like youre the only one trying in the relationship.\u000aJealous \u000aIf youre constantly jealous in youre relationship, theres clearly a reason. If you cant handle your partner talking to someone else, calling someone else, or youre constantly overreacting about what theyre doing when theyre not with you, you need to leave immediately. The jealously aspect will never go away and its a healthy relationship to be in otherwise.\u000aMiserable\u000aThere is absolutely no excuse for you to feel miserable in your relationship. Relationships are supposed to be up-lifting. You should be happy, not crying. You should be able to call your partner your best friend and have them understand you even if youre in an argument. Your partner shouldnt be the one making you miserable. They should be the person you go to when you want to be happy.\u000aConfused about whats going on\u000aPoint blank, if someone cares about you, theyre going to let you know how they feel. There will be no guessing game, youre not going to run away like a crazy person asking yourself where the two of you stand, you should have complete honesty. Your partner should never lie to you or lead you on. In a good, real relationship, everyone deserves the truth.  \u000aAngry all the time\u000aIts normal to get angry from time to time, but if you find yourself constantly battling it out or arguing more than youre actually enjoying each other, theres something going on. You shouldnt have to always be pissed off and angry. You should be able to get what you really deserve from a relationship: happiness.\u000aComments\u000a  comments

VMMA \u000aMiesha Tate unexpectedly announced her retirement from MMA fighting on Saturday at UFC 205, delivering the announcement immediately after losing her contest against Raquel Pennington.\u000aESPN reported Miesha Tate lost an unanimous decision to Raquel Pennington as the three judges scored the match 30-27, 30-27, 29-28. Miesha Tate warmly embraced her one-time apprentice in the middle of the ring after the match before delivering an impassioned retirement announcement to the UFC 205 audience.\u000aIm announcing my retirement, you guys. I love yall so much. Ive been doing this for over a decade. Thank you so much for being here. I love this sport forever. But its not my time anymore. Its the futures time.\u000aHappy retirement. The best. @MieshaTate #MieshaTate #CupCake #OneNineSix #UFC pic.twitter.com/i5X6tnrPay\u000a JC (@J189C) November 13, 2016\u000aThe 30-year-old fighter capped her 10-year-career by winning the UFC Bantamweight Title in March over Holly Holm, CBS Sports reported. Miesha Tate later dropped the title to the current champion  Amanda Nunes  in a bout during July.\u000aThe loss at UFC 205 means the Washington native ended her career with back-to-back losses. The results in the octagon, Miesha Tate acknowledged in her announcement, factored into her decision to retire when she did.\u000aIts because of the result. I had a lot more to give but I couldnt pull it out of myself. Its been a long time, taken a lot of punishment. I still love this sport. I love you guys so much, thank you, but this is it for me.\u000aMiesha Tate had flirted with the idea of retiring in 2015 when she was passed over for a chance to fight Ronda Rousey for a third time in favor of Holly Holm. Miesha Tate returned for a championship bout against Holly Holm, exacting revenge from the MMA fighter she felt robbed her of chance to finally beat Ronda Rousey.\u000aThe rivalry has ended as @MieshaTate announces her retirement after her loss at #UFC205. #UFCNYC #ArmbarNation pic.twitter.com/Ji0UBH2Wyf\u000a Team Rousey (@ArmbarNation) November 13, 2016\u000aThe retirement for Miesha Tate was extremely unexpected because the fighter had openly discussed a trilogy fight with Ronda Rousey as recently as last week, SB Nation reported. Miesha Tate had hoped to be next up for Ronda after Rousey met Amanda Nunes at UFC 207.\u000aI really would like another crack at her. I dont want a half-hearted version of Ronda anyway so I hope she comes back strong and I hope its not too much of a race against the clock. Definitely would like to face her in the future.\u000aThe MMA fighter decided to call it a career instead of wait for a final chance to fight Ronda Rousey that might not come. Heading into UFC 205, Miesha Tate predicted that Ronda Rousey would retire if the once-beaten MMA fighter loses to Amanda Nunes in her UFC 207 bout against the current champion, TMZ Sports reported.\u000aI dont know why everyone is so surprised by [the retirement talk], honestly. She was already talking about that before she fought Holly I already kind of knew this would probably be one of her last ones, if not potentially her last one, if she doesnt win it. I think it could be her last one.\u000aIndeed, Miesha Tate  who along with Ronda Rousey served as pioneers for the UFC womens division  may be right about Rousey being the next MMA fighter to retire. As a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show last week, Ronda Rousey told the host that she doesnt expect to fight much longer, the Los Angeles Times reported.\u000aMiesha Tate On Ronda Rouseys Return and Retirement Remarks https://t.co/uBnxyO6eWw pic.twitter.com/bj05qKgGb6\u000a MMAWeekly.com (@MMAWeeklycom) November 3, 2016\u000aOpenly discussing retirement for Ronda Rousey could serve as an out for a poor performance for the one-time champion. Ronda Rousey has not fought since November 2015 when she dropped her title to Holly Holm in a shocking fashion.\u000aMiesha Tate finished with a record of 18-7 in bouts held under the UFC and Strikeforce promotions.\u000aWhat do you think about the sudden retirement for Miesha Tate and her prediction that Ronda Rousey would join her in leaving UFC in the near future?

VSD800-07955 Dave Matos / Flickr CC BY-SA 2.0\u000aStories of girls getting pregnant after taking a dip in a public swimming pool have been around for a long time. Recently, a version of this story has gone viral on social media to the surprise of many people, but is it really possible to get pregnant just by swimming in a pool of water someone has ejaculated in?\u000aThe story first appeared February 2016 with reports that sixteen girls had become pregnant after a boy accidentally ejaculated into the water of a pool in which they were swimming. The girls were between the age of 13 and 17 years of age have become pregnant after a pool party went terribly wrong.\u000aHowever scientifically and statistically speaking, such a case is downright impossible. Sperm can survive for only a few minutes in warm water and given that swimming pools contain various chemicals to keep it crystal clear, their survival rate drops drastically.\u000aThe ratio of sperm to pool water is also comically minuscule that it would nothing short of a miracle for one girl to get pregnant in a swimming pool, let alone sixteen. Even in normal circumstances (intercourse) the chances of getting pregnant is not 100% even if conditions are optimal.\u000aSnopes has already reported that the original story came from fake news sites and therefore is not credible. The source article was originally published on 26 January 2016 by the fake news site World News Daily Report. It was subsequently picked up by other similar sites such as Huzlers, Nigerian Info, and Not Allowed To.\u000aFake as it may, this story is not the most unbelievable impregnation story out there. One such story originates from the civil war where a man was allegedly shot through in his groin after which the bullet hit a nearby woman between the thighs. The woman later gave birth to a baby nine months later.\u000aThe story was so popular; Discovery Channels Mythbusters even put it to the test. Of course, no man or woman was harmed during testing. And, like the swimming pool impregnation story, it was busted wide open.

VHave you ever been out at a bar or event and had someone who was trying to flirt with you ask you whats your sign? They are referring to your birth (sun) sign. According to astrology, everyone is born under a sun sign depending on their birthday and the cut off dates. Being that I am pretty fascinated by astrology, here is a small glimpse into the world of the universe.\u000a1. Capricorn (Dec 22- Jan 19)\u000aAs an earth sign, Capricorn is the first sign for the months and is known to be very practical. Those born under this sign possess an independence that enables significant progress both on the personal level and in business.\u000a2. Aquarius (Jan 20- Feb 18)\u000aAquarius are known to be generally shy and quiet, but on the other hand they can be eccentric and energetic. They are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others and solving problems. Intellect and logic are the two main factors that this sign runs off of.\u000a3. Pisces (Feb 19- March 20)\u000aAs a water sign, Pisces are known to be empathetic and easily able to express emotion. They are also very friendly and always willing to help others. They have really big hearts and would do almost anything for those they love.\u000a4. Aries (March 21- April 19)\u000aAs the first sign in the zodiac, Aries are energetic and active. Being that they are fire signs, they may act on impulse without thinking before acting on occasion. They are very dynamic, as they are known to easily adapt to situations and take charge. They are competitive and give their best at everything they do.\u000a5. Taurus (April 20- May 20)\u000aPeople born under the Taurus sign are very sensual and tactile. Stable and conservative, Taurus is among the most reliable signs of the zodiac. Although very level headed, they can tend to be stubborn and set in their ways at times. As an earth sign, Taurus can be overprotective of their loved ones.\u000a6. Gemini (May 21- June 20)\u000aExpressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different sides of personality. Gemini can be sociable, communicative and ready for fun, while on the other hand it can be very serious, thoughtful, restless and even indecisive. As an air sign, Gemini is concerned with all aspects of the mind. Their best skills are good communication, writing and teaching others.\u000a7. Cancer (June 21- July 22)\u000aCancer is very emotional and sensitive, and they care about family and home. Cancer is sympathetic and is very attached to the people who surround him. People born under the Cancer sign are very loyal and empathetic people, able to empathize with your pain and suffering.\u000a8. Leo (July 23 - August 22)\u000aMY SIGN! Probably one of the most prideful, loving, and hard working out of all of the signs. Born under the fire sign, Leos are dramatic, creative self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist. They can achieve anything they want, whether it's about work or time spent will family and friends.\u000a9. Virgo (August 23 - September 22)\u000aVirgos are always paying attention to smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Virgo is an Earth sign, which prefers conservative and organized things, and those dependent on them, burr can sometimes be too judgmental and critical of others and themselves.\u000a10. Libra (September 23 - October 22)\u000aPeople born under the sign of Libra are peaceful and fair. The Libra is an Air sign, with expressed intellect and a keen mind. They can be inspired by good books, discussions and interesting people. Quality is always more important than the quantity for people born under the Libra sign. They are often surrounded by art, music and beautiful places. Libra is also fascinated by balance and symmetry.\u000a11. Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)\u000aScorpios are known for their mysterious and calm nature. Being a water sign, Scorpios live to experience and express emotions. Although emotions are very important for Scorpio, they manifest them differently than other water signs. They keep secrets for years and are very strong leaders.\u000a12. Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21)\u000aSagittarius is extrovert, optimistic and enthusiastic, and likes changes. Sagittarius are able to transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals. They are also very blunt and honest.\u000aHCXO!

VYou may recall this exchange in the Oct. 9 presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton said, "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country." To which Trump replied, "Because you'd be in jail."\u000aIt wasn't clear then if candidate Trump was just grandstanding. Nor is it clear now if President-elect Trump will do what he also pledged then: "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception."\u000aIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal after he was elected, Trump didn't list prosecuting Clinton among his priorities. Still, half the country now worries, and the other half hopes, that Trump will make good on his threat. More likely, he'll contract the job out to House Republicans salivating over the prospect of televised hearings, starting with Clinton raising her right hand, then taking the Fifth over and over again.\u000aSo should President Barack Obama pardon her, pre-empting the GOP's plans for four years of show trials?\u000aRudolph Giuliani, mentioned as a possible attorney general, has already warned Obama off a pardon, while revealing to Fox News his firm belief that Obama and Clinton "have completely corrupted the Justice Department and the State Department" and predicting her inevitable indictment.\u000aTo assess the wisdom, legality and politics of a pardon, this is where to begin: The incoming administration already has its mind made up that she committed crimes and should be prosecuted. Given that, Obama shouldn't hesitate to pardon her -- even if she says she doesn't want him to.\u000aWithout it, Republicans will reopen the 35,000 emails turned over to the State Department. Thanks to WikiLeaks, they will rummage through thousands of emails to and from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. They will resume the search for the 33,000 emails that she said were personal and had deleted. They will second-guess FBI Director James Comey's decision that even if she had been "extremely careless" with her private server, she never intended to commit crimes.\u000aThey will also subpoena years of Clinton Foundation documents in search of pay-to-play favors and conflicts of interest during her tenure at the State Department. And they won't hesitate to draw in Bill Clinton and top aides Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, or place in legal jeopardy many other longtime associates.\u000aWhy would Republicans pursue Clinton, even though she is unlikely to run for office ever again? The simple answer is that "lock her up" energized Trump's campaign and propelled many House members' re-elections.\u000aThe question, then, isn't whether Obama should pardon her, but whether he will. His lawyers will look at past presidential pardons for guidance and ask: Would he be tarnishing his legacy if he takes action?\u000aBill Clinton certainly tarnished his own when, on his last day as president in January 2001, he pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich, skirting the Justice Department's usual procedures to do so. Rich's ex-wife had recently made a handsome donation to Clinton's library.\u000aThe case of Hillary Clinton is entirely different. She has been investigated almost continuously for four years. But in addition to being twice absolved by the FBI, she hasn't been accused of any specific crime, let alone indicted, tried or convicted.\u000aTo those Republicans who would say a pardon proves they were right all along, Obama can cite Gerald Ford's 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon. Though Ford's action probably cost him the election of 1976, he acted to bring the country together after two years of the Watergate scandal, congressional hearings, impeachment proceedings, a Supreme Court decision and finally Nixon's resignation.\u000aObama's lawyers will also look to other last-minute pardons, including President George H. W. Bush's Christmas Day 1992 exoneration of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and five others. They had been involved in the 1987 Iran-contra arms-for-hostages scandal in the Ronald Reagan administration.\u000aBush issued the pardons after letting the legal system run its course for six years: An independent prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, had obtained one conviction and three guilty pleas. Two other cases were about to go to trial. In his anger, Walsh revealed that President Bush was a subject of his probe, based on notes Bush had taken as Reagan's vice president, inviting accusations of a cover-up.\u000aPresident George W. Bush avoided similar allegations in his 2007 commutation of the 30-month prison sentence of Lewis Libby, an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. Libby had been convicted of lying and obstructing justice in the investigation into who leaked the name of Valerie Plame, a Central Intelligence Agency operative, to a columnist. Bush waited four years for the case to go through the federal courts before acting.\u000aObama doesn't have the luxury of waiting, as his predecessors did. The only way to head off a Republican vendetta against someone to whom we owe "a major debt of gratitude for her service to the country" -- as Trump said in his post-election address -- is with a pardon. \u000a---\u000aDwyer writes editorials on economics, finance and politics for Bloomberg View.

A new study released on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016 may reassure millions of arthritis sufferers who want pain relief without bad side effects.

A new study released on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016 may reassure millions of arthritis sufferers who want pain relief ... more\u000aNEW ORLEANS (AP)  A new study gives some reassurance to arthritis sufferers who want pain relief but are worried about side effects. It finds that Celebrex, a drug similar to ones withdrawn 12 years ago for safety reasons, is no riskier for the heart than some other prescription pain pills that are much tougher on the stomach.\u000a"We do not want patients to suffer with pain and we need to know what is safe to give them," said Dr. Steven Nissen, the Cleveland Clinic's heart chief, who led the study. Fear that Celebrex would be worse than alternatives proved unfounded, and "on almost every endpoint it actually comes out the best."\u000aSome other doctors were less confident, partly because follow-up information was missing on one-fourth of the participants, and many others stopped taking their assigned drug. Still, several independent experts said the main results are believable.\u000a"I find this reassuring," said Dr. Brian Strom, a drug safety expert and chancellor at Rutgers University in Newark. No new side effects emerged and Celebrex "seemed safer that way."\u000aResults were discussed Sunday at an American Heart Association conference and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\u000aHere are some things to know about the study and options for soothing throbbing joints.\u000aWHAT'S THE WORRY ABOUT PAIN DRUGS?\u000aMany of the 52 million Americans with arthritis need long-term pain medicines and higher doses than over-the-counter ones, but some can cause serious stomach trouble. Vioxx and Bextra became blockbusters because they avoided this problem, but heart concerns emerged and the drugs were withdrawn. Some research suggested that Celebrex, the lone drug left in that class, might pose risks at high doses. So the government required its maker, Pfizer, to do this new study to keep it on the market.\u000aThe study tested daily use of Celebrex versus prescription-strength ibuprofen or naproxen in 24,000 arthritis patients with heart disease or a risk factor for it such as diabetes. The results only apply to these drugs and amounts  not to occasional use of lower, over-the-counter doses (ibuprofen is sold as Motrin, Advil and other brands; naproxen is sold as Naprosyn and Aleve), or to other painkillers such as Tylenol.\u000aThe findings are not relevant to "somebody who takes an occasional ibuprofen or naproxen for a headache," Nissen said.\u000aAll of these drugs are available as generics, but Celebrex is not sold over the counter.\u000a___\u000aTHE RESULTS\u000aAfter more than two years in the study, about 2 percent of participants had suffered a heart attack, stroke, heart-related death or other heart problem regardless of what drug they were taking. This was a surprise: Earlier studies suggested naproxen would be safest.\u000aSerious stomach problems were more common with ibuprofen and naproxen. Kidney problems were more common with ibuprofen.\u000aThe study was not designed to compare the drugs for pain relief, but naproxen showed a small advantage on one measure of that over Celebrex.\u000a___\u000aWHAT WE DON'T KNOW\u000aThe study doesn't tell us whether any of these drugs is safer than no drug  there was no placebo group. All we can say is that if they raise heart risks, they do so equally.\u000aNo information was available on how many participants also were taking aspirin, which can interfere with ibuprofen and naproxen.\u000aTwo-thirds of participants stopped taking their assigned drug  a dropout rate typical of pain studies but still a problem for interpreting results. Discontinuation rates were similar for all three drugs, though.\u000aStill, researchers did what they could to account for these flaws, and the results are believable, said Dr. Bruce Psaty, a drug safety expert at the University of Washington in Seattle.\u000a___\u000aBIG CAVEATS\u000aThe study was aimed at people at high heart risk, yet only 20 percent of participants already had heart disease; the rest just had risk factors.\u000aAlso, people on ibuprofen or naproxen had more room to escalate their doses than those on Celebrex did because that drug's label limits it to what is considered safe now.\u000a"It's a low risk group getting a low dose" of Celebrex, said Dr. Elliott Antman, a past president of the Heart Association and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "I remain worried about the patient with known heart disease," and do not feel comfortable about any of these pain drugs for them, he said.\u000aDr. Carl "Chip" Lavie of Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, said the results confirm what he has been telling patients: Celebrex seems safer than many alternatives, and can be combined more safely with blood thinners and other medicines many people need.\u000a___\u000aTHE IMPACT\u000aAny vindication of Celebrex may be coming too late to benefit Pfizer. In 2013, the drug had U.S. sales of $2.2 billion, but that fell to around $185 million in 2015, the first full year there was a generic version, which sold $636 million that year, according to QuintilesIMS, a health research company.\u000aLast year in the U.S., about 8.3 million prescriptions were filled for Celebrex or its generic version, versus 43 million for ibuprofen and nearly 20 million for naproxen.\u000a___\u000aMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP

VSamuel Lockhart\u000aA 34-year-old woman who reported being injured in a random shooting in Volusia County was shot by an angry drug dealer who she paid with a fake $100 bill, investigators said.\u000aThe woman, who was not identified, reported the shooting at 12:20 a.m. Tuesday, but was shot late Monday, the Volusia County Sheriffs Office said.\u000aShe initially reported that she was in her car with a friend driving along Newmark Drive in Deltona when she was hit by gunfire, deputies said.\u000aWhile the bullet hole in the victims left wrist was real, not much else about her account of the shooting was, the sheriffs office said in a news release.\u000aAfter probing the womans story further, investigators found that she had been with her boyfriend and a third person to meet up with a drug dealer to purchase narcotics.\u000aWhen the dealer, later identified as Samuel Lockhart, 26, realized that he had been paid with a fake $100 bill, he pulled out a gun and fired into the victims car as it sped away, deputies said.\u000aThe woman was taken to Central Florida Regional Hospital for treatment and later said she had lied to investigators because she was afraid that Lockhart would retaliate against her, the sheriffs office said.\u000aLockhart was tracked down and arrested Thursday evening, deputies said.\u000aHe is charged with attempted second-degree murder, shooting into an occupied vehicle and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

VSay good-bye Michelle Obama and hello Melania Trump.\u000aWith the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, his third wife Melania becomes the first foreign-born first lady in two centuries.\u000aWill she make over the private quarters of the White House with elaborate gold furnishings? Who knows? But here are other facts  some well-known, some not  about the stylish 46-year-old former supermodel who will be the hostess of state dinners and lead the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.\u000aWhere shes from\u000aThe mom and jewelry designer was born on April 26, 1970 in Cold War-era Slovenia (then Yugoslavia) to a Communist party member father, who managed car dealerships for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer. Her mother made patterns for a textile factory.\u000aShe began modeling at age 16, and was spotted by a photographer as a 17-year-old, the Daily Mirror reported. His photos of her led to a contract with an Italian modeling agency. She also went to work in Paris, and graced catwalks and magazines, including Sports Illustrated.\u000aShe reportedly worked illegally when she first came to the United States \u000aWhile she has staunchly defended Donalds hardline stand on immigration, she was paid for 10 modeling jobs and earned around $20,000 before she was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996, the Associated Press reported. She received her green card in 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006.\u000aDuring that time before she received her work visa she also posed nude and in sexually intimate scenes with another woman in New York City for a photographer for a French mens magazine.\u000aShe met Donald Trump at a Manhattan club\u000aMelania was 28 when she met Donald in 1998. He was actually still married to wife no. 2 Marla Maples at the time. Donald was at the Kit Kat Club with another woman but reportedly made a beeline to Melania and asked for her number. Because he was there with another woman, she refused to give it to him C but she got his.\u000aTheir wedding was fabulous  and Hillary and Bill were there\u000aMelania wore a $125,000 dress John Galliano dress and a 12-carat, emerald-cut $1.5 million ring for her wedding to Donald in January 2005 in Palm Beach, Florida. They celebrated at a lavish reception at their Mar-a-Lago estate.\u000aThe reception was attended by notable figures like Heidi Klum, rapper P Diddy, Simon Cowell, and former President Bill Clinton and then-Senator Hillary Clinton.\u000aTo marry a man like Donald, you need to know who you are, she told Larry King. You need to be very strong and smart.\u000aDonald reportedly has not been faithful \u000aThe Wall Street Journal reported that Donald allegedly had an affair in 2006 with Playboy Playmate of the Year Karen McDougal. The Trump-friendly National Enquirer paid $150,000 for an exclusive interview with McDougal but then decided to kill the story?\u000aTheir son has a similar name as Trumps PR alter ego\u000aDonald has four adult chidren  Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany C with wives no. 1 and 2. Donald and Melanias son, Barron William Trump, was born in 2006.\u000aDonald Trump, Barron Trump and Melania Trump in March 2007. (Photo by Peter Kramer/Getty Images For MSKCC) \u000aThere was a time when Donalds celebrity was mostly centered around New York City. During the 1970s and 1980s, reporters who covered him remember getting calls from his Manhattan office that involved conversations with John Miller or John Barron, public relations representatives who sounded precisely like Trump himself, the Washington Post reported. \u000aMaster Barron, now 10, is said to like wearing a suit and tie, and Melanies nickname for him is Mini-Donald.\u000aMelania was not an enthusiastic campaigner\u000aThroughout the campaign, Melania has mostly kept a low profile, often leaving it to her stepdaughter Ivanka to play Trumps female campaign surrogate.\u000aWhen she makes a public appearance, she has tended to bring unwanted attention to herself or the campaign. Speaking on behalf of her husband at the Republican National Convention, she was caught plagiarizing lines for her speech from Michelle Obamas at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\u000aThose nude photos again\u000aThe nude photos Melania shot in 1995 were somehow leaked to the New York Post in August. But people wondered who leaked them and why: to embarrass and shame Melania; to stir up Americans puritanical views about nudity, sexuality and the conduct of political spouses?\u000aDonald certainly wasnt upset about their publication:\u000aMelania was one of the most successful models and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines, he told the Post. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.\u000aHer cause as first lady? Ending cyberbullying\u000aDespite being married to probably the biggest cyberbully of them all, Melania said that as first lady she wants to dedicate herself to stopping cyberbullying and increasing civility.\u000aOur culture has become too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers, Melania said at a rally in Berwyn, Pa. last week. We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\u000aWhat she and Hillary have in common\u000aAccording to a Gallup poll, Melania is the least popular presidential candidate spouse since  Hillary Clinton.\u000aFiveThirtyEight, citing two national surveys, said Melania has just a 28 percent favorable rating compared to a 32 percent unfavorable rating. That was lower than Bill Clintons net favorability and its lower than the net favorability of every presidential nominees spouse in every final campaign poll that asked the question since 1988.\u000aThe most popular spouse was Barbara Bush, George H W Bushs wife. Michelle Obama was also viewed fairly positively at about this stage of 2012.

VThe USS Illinois (SSN 786) at Naval Submarine Base New London.\u000aOn Oct. 29, the USS Illinois (SSN 786) was commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut, the 13th Virginia-class attack submarine to join the fleet, according to M. Dawn Scott, Navy Office of Community Outreach.\u000aThe submarine is named after the great state of Illinois, the home to the Navys one and only Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes where every enlisted Sailor begins his or her service.\u000aAs the most modern and sophisticated attack submarine in the world, the submarine can operate in both littoral and deep ocean environments and presents combatant commanders with a broad and unique range of operational capabilities. Illinois is a flexible, multi-mission platform designed to carry out the seven core competencies of the submarine force: anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, delivery of special operations forces, strike warfare, irregular warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and mine warfare.\u000aWhy Being There Matters\u000aMore than 70 percent of the Earth is covered by water, so the ability to act from the sea matters. The worlds oceans give the Navy the power to protect and defend Americas interests anywhere, and at any time. Navy ships, submarines, aircraft and, most importantly, tens of thousands of Americas finest young men and women are deployed around the world doing just that. Navy personnel is there around the clock, defending America at all times.\u000aLocally, Navy Veteran Terry Jelinek and his wife, Sue, served on the Commissioning Committee for the USS Illinois with plans to attend the event in Connecticut. The last time a ship was commissioned with the name of the state of ILLINOIS was in 1897.

VOnce Fall weather rolls in, it means having to navigate a season's worth of holidays typically based on one thing  eating. It all starts with pumpkin-flavored baked goodies, moves on to bite-size chocolate morsels, then to an entire day devoted to preparing, cooking, and eating a day's worth of calories in one sitting. Then comes December with crispy latkes and those adorably shaped, irresistible iced sugar cookies and more eating. Then, of course, there's the final holiday devoted to sipping cocktails and Champagne. Before trading in your jeans for some fancy, stretchy yoga leggings, certified dietitian Leslie Langevin, MS, RD, CD of Whole Health Nutrition has five tips to help you enjoy the holidays without expanding your waistline. \u000a1. Save Room For Dessert\u000a A slice of warm apple-coconut crumb pie with ice cream, those signature peanut butter kiss cookies, a classic cup of creamy eggnog  there are so many amazing desserts to look forward to this time of year. If you know this is something you really want eat (who doesn't?!), take a smaller portion of your main meal by using a smaller plate. This way you can save room in your tummy for this delicious extra.\u000a2. Aim For Color\u000a Fill your plate with vibrantly colored options to help reduce your caloric intake. For appetizers, choose veggies over crunchy carbohydrate choices and seek out dips that are veggie- instead of cream-based. For meals, go for cranberry sauce instead of gravy, roasted sweet potatoes over buttery mashed potatoes, a salad over green bean casserole or loaded stuffing, and if bread is a must, go for whole grain. This helps boost phytonutrient intake and also keeps calories lighter.\u000a3. Ask This Question\u000a"Am I hungry?" This is the question you should ask yourself every time you grab something to eat. Listen to your own body's signals and make sure you're aware of and truly hungry for each bite you're reaching for. This will challenge your willpower immensely, since holiday get togethers always involve bowls and platters of nibbles. Remember that you don't have to join in just because other people are noshing. Focus on the amazing conversations and the people you're with, and eat when your body is ready, not when food is served.\u000a4. Go Lighter Earlier\u000a On the actual holiday, you know an obscenely enormous meal is on the horizon. No need to skip breakfast and lunch  that will screw up your metabolism and make you so famished, you'll end up devouring even more. Just eat lighter in the beginning of your day, so you'll be hungry for that larger meal. A green smoothie for breakfast and a salad for lunch is perfect.\u000a5. Celebrate and Be Done\u000a The actual holidays are one or two days long, so you should give yourself permission to indulge on those days. Giving into your cravings will allow you to move on, so you're not obsessing about it the entire season. Just remember not to let one day of overindulging lead to weeks of too much. Enjoy the amazing food, then start eating healthy the following day.

VMovie Trailers \u000aThe Underworld franchise seems poised to revitalize itself with Underworld: Blood Wars, especially after the release of this newest action-packed trailer. While Kate Beckinsale has long been the driving force in most of the previous films, this latest trailer may prove that, while it is endlessly thrilling to see Beckinsales Selene back in action (and back in black latex), the woman behind the camera, Anna Foerster, deserves as much credit for delivering an exciting, battle driven sequel.\u000aUnderworld: Blood Wars Raises The Stakes And Puts Kate Beckinsale In The Thick Of It\u000a Check out my new #underworldbloodwars poster for #sony with #katebeckinsale @jp_reps @garymantoosh ??\u000aA photo posted by John russo (@johnrussophoto) on Nov 12, 2016 at 4:23pm PST\u000aThe latest trailer for Underworld: Blood Wars isnt as focused on Kate Beckinsales Selene as previous teasers have been and /Film points out that this new perspective gives greater detail in respect to the films plot. While Marvel and DC Comics compete to prove theyre open to creating female driven films, the Underworld franchise continues its long established tradition of delivering female empowered stories. For Underworld: Blood Wars, Screen Gems brought in Anna Foerster to direct, giving her a shot at heading up her first feature film. Previously, Foerster worked as a visual effects artist and cinematographer, before moving on to directing television.\u000aAs the two minute Underworld: Blood Wars preview opens, the vampire clans are facing extinction at the hands of their former servants, the lycans, who are assembling in a great mass to form an army the likes of which the vampires have never before faced.\u000aMeanwhile, Selene (Beckinsale) is counseled by a mysterious voice, learning that she must be willing to give a great sacrifice in exchange for earning the power to defeat the lycans and end this age old feud once and for all. As has been indicated in previous teasers, theres a strong possibility that Selene will meet her demise in Underworld: Blood Wars, only to come back from the dead as an even more powerful immortal. This may be the sacrifice and the gift to which the voice alludes.\u000aThe official synopsis for Underworld: Blood Wars adds more meat to a plot only slightly broadened in the trailer.\u000aUnder the new leadership of Marius, the Lycans have increased in numbers and strength and have decimated many of the vampire covens throughout the world. With the Vampire race being on the brink of extinction, it is up to Selene to save the very coven which banished her and hunted her down as a criminal. Selene must become stronger than ever to defeat whats in store for her next.\u000aRelated Links:\u000aKate Beckinsale Carries On Her Crazy Instagram Antics\u000a Ingrid gets anxiety if she doesn't have eyes on my crotch at all times .

She paired an extremely low-cut black bodysuit with dark pants and strappy sandals. The whole look was pulled together with a stunning blue velvet jacket. Jones wore a minimalistic makeup look and pulled her hair back into a low ponytail to showcase her natural beauty.\u000aJones wasn't the only one to take the plunge, though. Isla Fisher, who stars in the film, also showed some cleavage as she walked the carpet before the premiere. The 40-year-old actress wore a striking black strapless dress that featured a revealing navel cut-out. She paired the chic number with simple black sandals and a black clutch, forgoing any jewelry. Fisher's signature red hair was styled in glamorous waves for the big night, and she rocked a red lip as she posed for pictures.\u000aNow that's how you show some skin!

But hell be a good team guy, be backup and wait.\u000a Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 13, 2016\u000aThe Cowboys have waffled back and forth on their QB dilemma all season as Romo recovered from a back injury he suffered in preseason. Team owner Jerry Jones initially said Romo would get his job back when healthy, but since has backed off on that stance with Prescott leading Dallas to a 7-1 record.\u000aAnd while Romo and Prescott reportedly are OK with how things are shaking out, ESPNs Ed Werder reports their could be discontent in the rest of the locker room.\u000aWith Romo close to being in uniform, #Cowboys source says, "I'm not worried about Dak at all. Now the rest of the team, that is a concern."\u000a Ed Werder (@Edwerderespn) November 13, 2016\u000aSome #Cowboys concerned about effect of Tony Romo availability and potential QB change on team's great chemistry was earlier point\u000a Ed Werder (@Edwerderespn) November 13, 2016\u000aRomo, a four-time Pro Bowler whos spent all 13 of his NFL seasons with the Cowboys, is the bona fide leader of the team, so its understandable his teammates might be upset hes not getting his job back. Its hard to argue with results, though, and as long as Dallas keeps winning, that should help quiet any locker room dissonance.

VA Connecticut woman bought a desk from Staples, but after a few years grew tired of it. She decided to sell it to Noah Muroff and his wife for about $150 on Craigslist. \u000aThere was nothing peculiar about the transaction at all. \u000aMuroff and his wife had difficulty fitting the desk into the room. They decided to take it apart to fit it in. After Noah removed the filing cabinets, he noticed a plastic bag poking out. \u000aFirst, he saw a $100 bill. Then he saw that inside there were stacks of them. He and his wife counted the money. There was a whopping $98,000. \u000aIf we didnt take those drawers out, we never would have found it, Muroff said. \u000aBut he knew immediately that he couldnt keep the money. He called the woman he bought it from. It turned out she hid her inheritance in the desk and couldnt remember where she put it. When Muroff called her, she was speechless. \u000aShe was so shocked and touched that anyone would call, he said. She said, You could have kept the money and nobody would have ever known. \u000aMuroff, who is a rabbi, and his wife believe honesty is the most important thing. \u000aWe both agreed that this is not our money, he said. \u000aIf God wants us to have $98,000, hell make sure to give it to us in some other way. \u000aThe woman was so grateful, she summed up how she felt in a thank-you card.\u000aI do not think there are too many people in this world that would have done what you did by calling me. I do like to believe that there are still good people left in this crazy world we live in. You certainly are one of them, the woman wrote. I cannot thank you enough for your honesty and integrity.\u000aPlease SHARE this story if youre glad Noah Muroff did the right thing for the woman!

VWhoa! The woman in this video is either really brave or totally insane. Wolves have always been a source of fear for humans, and in the wild, they have been known to hunt people who were unlucky enough to wander into their part of the forest. That being said, they're also highly intelligent, majestic animals who have often been misunderstood.\u000aWolves are essentially giant, wild dogs. In fact, it's quite likely that the first domesticated dogs may have even branched off from the wolf family tree. Like most animals, they don't pose a danger to humanity unless they are in extreme situations and/or feel threatened. \u000aAt the Colorado Wolf \u005cu0026 Wildlife Center, dedicated animal experts work with wolves to help care for them, rehabilitate them, and to raise public awareness about these animals. In this video, we see one of the wolf handlers, Danielle, is spending some time with a wolf named Kekoa, when another, even bigger wolf called Sakara comes over and decides to snuggle up with her like a puppy dog!\u000aBe sure to SHARE this video with your family and friends.

VEverett Collection\u000aWant a snack on your next flight, or an extra inch of legroom? You better pony up some cash because airlines are charging for more perks than ever before. While many of the new fees can and probably should be avoided, experts say, some are well worth it. \u000aIn 2015, airlines in North America raked in $3.8 billion in baggage fees, up from about $3.5 billion in 2014, according to data released in May by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The airlines also took in another $3 billion in reservation cancellation/change fees, up slightly from a year prior. \u000aAmong the fees worth skipping are: printing your boarding pass (Spirit Airlines charges $10 for passes printed by one of its staff members), onboard snacks (most airlines charge for at least premium snacks), and booking by phone ($35 on Spirit). Some carriers also now charge for carry-on bags, so make sure the total cost of your ticket, with these fees included, is still worth the priceor else opt for an airline that doesnt have these fees. (For its part, Spirit is upfront about its fees, declaring that we believe in paying for what you use, not what you dont  never pay for someone elses free bags.)\u000aStill, there are fees that even the budget-conscious may want to consider payingif only to make a long flight or irritating layover more bearable. Here are four.\u000aPremium economy seats\u000aThese seats, which have a variety of names like economy comfort and premium economy typically offer more legroom, as well as the ability to recline further and power outlets for charging laptops and phones. It usually costs about $10 to $50 to get one of these seats, depending on the length of the flight, says Rick Seaney, the CEO of FareCompare.com. \u000a When its worth it: Seaney says this upgrade isnt typically a good deal on short flights, but once you hit the three-hour mark, these fees start to look better. Make sure you look at what these premium seats offerhow many inches of legroom and other perks (some even throw in priority boarding)as it varies significantly by airline.\u000aOne-day airline lounge passes\u000aThe lounge areas for airlines have perks like free snacks and drinks (sometimes including beer and wine), free Wi-Fi, as well as quieter areas and nicer seats than in the general waiting area. The price for a one-day pass is about $50 and passengers can usually bring small children (under age 2 or 3) in for free. \u000a When its worth it: For a long layover of two hours or more thats worth it, says Trettin. And it may be especially worth it for those with multiple stops, since many airlines let you use this in each of the locales (as long as its on the same day), adds Bonnie Lee, the CEO of the Travel Leaders franchise in Albertville, Minn. So if you take off in one airport and have a layover in another, you could use the lounge in both, she explains. Note that if you have an airline credit card, you may be able to get this perk for free (just beware of the annual fees and other charges that these cards carry).\u000aSeat assignments\u000aAs anyone whos been relegated to the middle seat and then sandwiched between two large people knows, the middle seat can be a recipe for a very uncomfortable flight. It used to be that you could guarantee yourself an aisle or window if you just booked early and picked your location, but now some airlines like Spirit are charging you to pick a seat (their fees between $1 and $50). If you dont buy a seat, its a free for all, says Kim Reicherter-Specht, a travel agent with Tzell Travel in New York. You dont want that. \u000a When its worth it: Seaney says that like premium economy seats, picking your seat can be worth the money on longer flights, usually those that are three hours or more. Lee says that picking a seat is especially good for families with young children, who want easy access to the front or back of the plane near the bathrooms.\u000aIn-flight Wi-Fi\u000aMany airlines charge for Wi-FiSouthwest charges $8 a day per device, Delta and American charge $16 for an all-day passand while travelers grumble about paying it, its often worth it, experts say. This is one of the biggest fees we see people paying for, says Trettin, as it not only provides entertainment to passengers (and a break from the sometimes limited in-flight TV and movie options, even though you usually cant stream video and music), but also the ability to get work done. \u000a When its worth it: Wi-Fi is often worth it for long flights, especially on airlines that have limited entertainment options. Frequent travelers may especially benefit from this, as there are package deals (a monthly subscription to Delta and Americans Wi-Fi costs about $50) that can help them save money. Lee says that families may also benefit quite a bit, as they can buy one monthly subscription and share that cost by sharing the login.

VAs we described at length in a separate article, an unusual feature of the Electoral College system employed by the United States for presidential elections is that the candidate who receives the most votes overall nationwide (i.e., "wins the popular vote") does not necessarily win the election. On five occasions prior to 2016 (most recently in 2000), the Electoral College installed in the White House a president who received fewer popular votes than his opponent. This phenomenon seemingly recurred in 2016, when Hillary Clinton apparently won the popular vote by a considerable margin by lost the election to opposing candidate Donald Trump.\u000aThe electoral/popular vote disparity prompted calls and petitions for the Electoral College delegates to ignore their pledges and instead cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, the putative winner of the popular vote:\u000aThat movement led to 0 claims that Donald Trump had, in fact, won the popular vote in addition to the electoral vote  or that he would prove to be the winner of the former if all the ballots cast were actually counted:\u000a First of all, [Clinton's] probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. States dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arent counted.\u000aAs of this writing, though, the ballots counted so far still show Hillary Clinton winning the national popular vote by a healthy margin of over 630,000 votes:\u000aMoreover, the popular vote margin favoring Hillary Clinton is likely to grow rather than shrink as more of the remaining ballots are counted. A spreadsheet compiled by David Wasserman, an editor at Cook Political Report who is tracking turnout, shows Clinton up by over 700,000 votes as of this writing, and as the Atlantic noted on 12 November 2016, the bulk of remaining uncounted ballots come from states that went heavily for the Democratic candidate:\u000a A majority of [uncounted ballots] are on the coasts, in New York, California, and Washington. She should be able to win those votes, probably 2-1. By mid-December, when the Electoral College officially casts its ballots, Wasserman estimates that Clinton could be ahead by 2 percentage points in the popular vote.\u000aWhats with the delay? Several states, notably California and Washington, have liberal absentee and mail-in voting laws. California, for instance, allows residents to submit ballots up to three days late (although they must be postmarked on or before Election Day). These provisions have made alternative voting pretty popular, and the ballots a bit harder to count. California alone has more than 4 million votes pending; Washington is waiting on another 700,000.\u000aThe notion that states don't count absentee ballots unless they are sufficient in number to change the outcome has been addressed (and refuted) by Vote.org:\u000aAre absentee ballots counted?\u000aYes, all votes are counted, whether they're cast in-person or by absentee ballot. \u000aIt is a common misconception that absentee ballots are only counted during very tight races. This misconception stems from two things: one, absentee ballots are often counted for days after the election since many are coming from abroad; two, absentee ballots are often a small percentage of all voted ballots. Many elections have a clear winner, so the absentee ballots that are still being counted after election night don't affect the results as predicted right after the polls close. As absentee voting becomes more popular, however, an increasing number of elections are decided by absentee ballots. \u000aLikewise, the web site of the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) states:\u000a Many absentee ballots are cast by voters who are unable to vote at their physical polling place due to being an active duty military member, a family member of someone on active duty or a U.S. citizen residing overseas. All ballots submitted according to State laws are counted in every election.\u000aThe media often will report the projected outcome of the election before all of the ballots are counted. In a close election, the media may report that the outcome cannot be announced until after the absentee ballots are counted. However, all ballots, including absentee ballots, are counted in the final totals for every election, and every vote (absentee or in-person) counts the same.\u000aBut as satisfying (or disappointing) as it may be to Hillary Clinton supporters to see that more Americans voted for her than for any other candidate  including Donald Trump  that fact won't change the outcome in any way:\u000a While these uncounted votes may grow Clintons popular lead, they absolutely will not change the course of the election. That math is settled; Trump holds an insurmountable lead in swing states, which turned his popular defeat into a sizable electoral victory. All the votes in liberal-leaning New York and California will not change that.\u000aOriginally published: 13 November 2016

VTwo-headed sharks may seem like science fiction, but National Geographic is pointing out that they seem to be becoming more common around the world. \u000aAs the report notes, past discoveries include two-headed pre-term sharks found off the Florida coast and in the Indian Ocean as well as two sets of conjoined twins found around Mexico.\u000aScientists in Spain have also announced that one of their lab shark embryos was growing two heads which is one of the first known instances of the phenomenon appearing in an egg-laying member of the species. \u000aAs the team states in the resulting study, "Each head had a mouth, two eyes, a brain, a notochord [like a spinal cord], and five gill openings on each side."\u000aThey also identified separate hearts, stomachs, and livers but one set of shared intestines, kidneys, and reproductive system. \u000aWhile researchers don't exactly know why these mutations are happening, occurrences in the wild have been attributed to infections, pollution, and overfishing causing the gene pool to shrink. \u000aA recent BBC report also describes past accounts of two-headed dolphins, snakes, and turtles.

VSamer Alaaeldin Mahran has been charged with rape by use of drugs, sexual penetration of a child over age 14 and unlawful sexual intercourse.\u000a An Uber driver in California has been charged with raping an intoxicated teenager after she passed out in the backseat of his car, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\u000a Samer Alaaeldin Mahran, 23, was supposed to drive a 17-year-old girl from a Huntington Beach bar to her Laguna Beach home in the predawn hours of Nov. 5. At some point during the ride, the teen, only identified as Jane Doe by prosecutors, became unconscious and Mahran, rather than driving her home, parked a few blocks from her house.\u000a Prosecutors describe in chilling detail how Mahran proceeded to climb into the backseat before orally copulating, raping and sexually assaulting Doe while she was too drunk to realize what was happening.\u000a One of Does family members, who had ordered the ride for her, grew concerned when she didnt arrive home at the expected time, prosecutors said. A second family member then used the Uber application to track her ride, quickly finding out she was in fact just a few blocks away.\u000aA number of drivers for the San Francisco-based company have been accused of committing crimes against their customers in recent years.\u000a The relative walked over to Mahrans parked car and discovered Doe and the alleged rapist in the backseat. Mahran bolted from the scene, leaving his car behind as the relative helped Doe to her feet.\u000a The victims family immediately alerted police who identified Mahran using his description, license plate number and driver profile. He was arrested at his Huntington Beach apartment later that day.\u000a He was charged on a slew of felony counts, including rape by use of drugs, sexual penetration of a child over age 14 and unlawful sexual intercourse. He was released on $100,000 bond and is expected to reappear in court on Dec. 2. He could face up to 28 years in prison if convicted.\u000aMahran could face up to 28 years in prison.\u000a Uber officials did not immediately return a request for comment from the Daily News.\u000a The car service company  which is headquartered in San Francisco  screens drivers criminal histories before issuing them licenses. Yet, there have been a number of drivers in recent years accused of committing crimes against their customers, including Jeremy Vague, a 37-year-old San Diego man who allegedly sexually assaulted at least three women while employed by Uber and ride-hailing competitor Lyft.\u000a A statement posted to Ubers website last year concedes that it is impossible for the company to guarantee every customers safety.\u000a We believe that Uber is a safe, reliable way to get from A to B, the statement says. That said, no means of transportation can ever be 100% safe. Accidents and incidents will always happen.

VRecognizing that Social Security reform has derailed Republican candidates in the past, Donald Trump took a third-rail approach to discussing Social Security on the campaign trail. Now that Trump is the next president of the United States, however, he may have to become more vocal about his plans for the important safety net for retirees. Congress is firmly in the hands of Republicans who have previously recommended big changes to Social Security, so it's likely that at least some of those proposals will make their way to the Oval Office. Let's take a closer look at what could be on tap for Social Security over the next four years.\u000aIMAGE SOURCE: MICHAEL VADON VIA FLICKR.\u000aFirst, some backround\u000aSocial Security is designed to replace roughly 40% of the average retiree's pre-retirement paycheck, but tens of millions of retiring baby boomers are straining Social Security's balance sheet, and that's got Washington predicting that Social Security's reserves will run dry in 2034.\u000aSince Social Security is the primary source of income for millions of Americans, Republicans have advocated for legislation that could put the program on solid financial ground. They've proposed a number of potential solutions, but perhaps themost contentious of them is privatizing some, or all, of Social Security.\u000aIn 2010, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's privatization plan called for Americans to shift one-third of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts, and in 2004, Ryan co-sponsored a proposal with John Sununu to require Americans to buy an annuity upon retirement that invests in stocks and bonds. In both instances, the privatization argument failed to gain bipartisan support, but that doesn't mean some variation of privatization is no longer on the table.\u000aOther Republican proposals are less transformative. A range of possible solutions were debated during the presidential primary race, including raising the full retirement age to 70 from 66, and means testing Social Security payments to reduce payments to wealthy Americans.\u000aSome Republican candidates, including Trump advisor Chris Christie, also suggested changing the formula used to calculate future Social Security benefits. Currently, benefit adjustments are tied to the Consumer Price Index; However, changing that formula to the slower-growing chained-CPI index could reduce the increase in payments over time, thereby stretching Social Security's solvency beyond 2034.\u000aIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\u000aA ticking time-bomb\u000aSocial Security outlays have outstripped payroll tax revenue since 2010, and Social Security's Trustees estimate that if something isn't done to address the shortfall, then every Social Security recipient will face a 21% across-the-board cut to their Social Security benefit in 2034.\u000aSocial Security's insolvency risk suggests that despite the unsavory nature of tackling Social Security reform, it must be done sooner rather than later.\u000aIn 2015 alone, Social Security payroll tax revenue totaled $679.5 billion, but Social Security paid out $743 billion to recipients.That's an unsustainable trend that isn't stopping anytime soon. Given the program's $11.4 trillion in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years, Social Security is on a bankruptcy trajectory course, and absent reform, there's a real risk that the Social Security checks that half of single seniors rely on for 90% of their monthly income will disappear.\u000aTrump's plan\u000aTrump wants to fix Social Security by significantly boosting economic growth so that wages and payroll tax revenue increases.\u000aIn 2017, Social Security taxes of 12.4% will be applied to workers' earnings up to $127,200. Thus, if wages rise because of improving economic activity, then annual tax revenue will also increase, and if the increase is big enough, then a significant amount of the shortfall could be eliminated.\u000aThis approach is tremendously attractive in theory, because it means no changes need to be made to Social Security; however, inreality, any number of unforeseen circumstances could derail economic and wage growth and therefore negatively affect tax revenue.\u000aTying it together\u000aIf Congress sends Social Security reform to Trump's desk, he may veto it, or approve it. We simply don't know, because Trump hasn't backed any specific proposal. What we can guess is that Trump won't support the Democrats'plan to prop up Social Security by increasing the income tax limit beyond $127,200. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both proposed changes that would have resulted in having the payroll tax apply to higher-income earners, but Trump's anti-tax stance makes adopting that plan unlikely.\u000aThe $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook \u000aIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known "Social Security secrets" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year!

VIt has only been two days since the election but soon-to-be First Lady Melania Trump has already sent social media into meltdown.\u000aMelania, 46, has changed her name on Instagram to firstladymelaniatrump with still 10 weeks to go until Donald Trump is officially sworn in and given the keys to the White House.\u000aTrump currently holds the title of President-Elect and will do so until the inauguration ceremony on January 20.\u000aBarack and Michelle Obama will officially hold the status and duties of President of the United States and The First Lady until then.\u000aUsers have begun furiously flooding Melania's account with messages that call the premature change "disrespectful".\u000a"I can't, no disrespect to another woman but it's not classy to update your status to "firstlady" when there is still another OFFICIAL First Lady currently in the White House," one user wrote.\u000a"Barack and Michelle are our President and First Lady, please have some respect," wrote another.\u000a"Gees, can you just wait till Inauguration Day to take the title First Lady," wrote a third.\u000aAll we can say is, guys, this had to happen someday. And she probably had to just save the handle to make sure nobody else snapped it up.\u000aThe majority of the hate is on the image Melania uploaded only hours ago of her and Donald Trump touring the White House.\u000aSuch a Honor today to visit the White House. Thank You President Obama and The First Lady for being so gracious. God Bless our beautiful Country. ????\u000aA photo posted by Melania Trump (@firstladymelaniatrump) on Nov 10, 2016 at 1:47pm PST\u000aMelania captioned the image with an explicit recognition of First Lady Michelle Obama.\u000a"Such a Honor today to visit the White House.

VProtester Sonja Spray carries a sign reading "WOMEN are NO JOKE" in Chicago's Millennium Park on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. Several hundred people joined a Chicago demonstration to protest the election of Donald Trump as president.\u000a NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES\u000aDemonstrators across the United States planned to take to the streets for a fifth straight day on Sunday to protest the election of Donald Trump, as the president-elect sparred on social media with one of the nation's largest newspapers.\u000aProtests were scheduled for Sunday afternoon in New York City and Oakland, California, according to online announcements.\u000aThousands in several cities have demonstrated since the results from Tuesday's election showed Mr. Trump lost the popular tally but gained enough votes in the 538-person Electoral College to win the presidency, surprising the world.\u000aLargely peaceful demonstrators have decried Trump's campaign promises to restrict immigration and register Muslims, as well as allegations the former reality-TV star sexually abused women.\u000aDozens have been arrested and a handful of police injured.\u000aChanting "Not my president" and "love trumps hate," people marched in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere on Saturday, saying Trump threatens their civil and human rights.\u000aCivil rights groups have monitored violence against U.S. minorities since Trump's win, citing reports of attacks on women in Islamic head scarves, of racist graffiti and of bullying of immigrant children. They have called on Trump to denounce the attacks.\u000aTrump, a Republican, resumed his complaints against the media on Sunday on Twitter, attacking the New York Times for coverage that he said was "very poor and highly inaccurate."\u000a"The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?" Trump wrote.\u000aThe newspaper published a letter in Sunday's editions from publisher Arthur Sulzberger and executive editor Dean Baquet, not apologizing, but thanking readers for their loyalty and asking how news outlets underestimated Trump's support.\u000aThe Times plans to "hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly" during the Trump presidency, they wrote.\u000aMORE THAN 20 ARRESTED\u000aOrganizers of the weekend protests said they wanted to build on momentum after several nights of unrest triggered by the real-estate mogul's surprise win.\u000aPolice in Portland, Oregon, where a protester was shot but not seriously injured early on Saturday, said they arrested more than 20 people late Saturday after protesters tossed burning flares and bottles at them and refused orders to disperse.\u000aIn New York, several thousand protesters marched peacefully up Fifth Avenue before filling the streets at the foot of Trump Tower, the president-elect's skyscraper home.\u000a"We're horrified the country has elected an incredibly unqualified, misogynist racist on a platform that was just totally hateful," said Mary Florin-McBride, 62, a retired banker from New York who held a sign reading "No Fascism in America."\u000aThere were also demonstrations in Chicago and Los Angeles, where several thousand protesters gathered beneath MacArthur Park's palm trees holding placards including "Dump Trump" and "Minorities Matter," before marching toward downtown.\u000aSome waved American, Mexican or rainbow flags. Holding a "Keep Love Legal" sign, 25-year-old gay Los Angeles resident Alex Seedman called Trump a fascist and feared he would repeal marriage equality.\u000aEvelyne Werzola, 46, an immigrant from South Africa, said she had seen what a police state could do.\u000a"I've seen people oppressed. And this is like a heartbreak of the American dream for me," Ms. Werzola said. "So I'm fighting to keep what America has stood for alive."\u000aKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said on Fox News on Sunday that she was sure many of the protesters were paid professionals, though she offered no proof.\u000aSuggesting a double standard, Ms. Conway said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that if Democrat Hillary Clinton had won and Trump supporters had protested, "people would be freaking out that his supporters were not accepting election results."

VA young actress plays the role of Giorgia, 10, forced to marry Paolo, 47, during a happening organized by Amnesty International to denounce child marriage, on Oct. 27, 2016 in Rome. Approximately one in three girls in the developing world are married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund. (Gabriel Bouys | Getty Images)\u000aThis may be a surprise to most New Jerseyans but with the consent of parents, teenagers as young as 16 may legally marry in New Jersey; and with a court order they can marry even younger. \u000aNew Jersey is not alone. Every state permits 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent; and to marry under 16 with court order for a variety of reasons including pregnancy or birth of a child. \u000aAssembly Bill 3091 would increase the marriage age to 18 years in New Jersey.\u000aHistorically, minimum marriage age mirrored the age of consent. In 13th century England, the age of consent was 12 years. Most of England's North American colonies considered the age of 10 and 11 sufficient for a girl to consent. The French Napoleonic code in 1791 established an age of consent of 11 years (for girls) and increased it to 13 years in 1863 (for boy and girls). In most of Europe during the 18th century, the age of consent was set at 10-12 years. By the late 18th and early 19th century, the age increased to between 13 and 16 years.\u000aThe age of consent was triggered with a girl's menstruation. In "Age of Consent Laws," scholar Stephen Robertson found that the British in India adopted a younger age for consent for Indians than for English girls because of their belief that Indian girls matured and menstruated earlier than white girls. White Americans similarly argued that the age of consent for African Americans, Mexicans and Italians should be earlier.\u000aThe marriage age in secular law was similar to the marriage age in religious traditions. Canon law that currently governs different Christian denominations in Lebanon and Egypt is illustrative. While Roman Orthodox law set 15 years as the marriage age for a girl, the Syriac Orthodox set the age at 12 years for a girl. The Egyptian Jewish Family Code set the marriage age for a boy to 13 and for a girl 12 and half years. Islamic law viewed puberty as the marriage age, which ranged from 10-15 years. Most Middle Eastern countries today have increased the minimum marriage age to 16-18 years, which apply to all citizens irrespective of religion.\u000aNearly one in three girls in developing countries are married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\u000aGordon B. Dahl in "Early Teen Marriage and Future of Poverty" found that teen marriages are two-thirds more likely to end in divorce. Teen marriages have more children and they have them earlier. Dahl also found lower education levels associated with those who marry in their teens and are 50 percent more likely to drop out of high school. Without a high school diploma, let alone a college degree, these teenage brides are vulnerable for abuse both physical and emotional. They are more likely to become economically dependent and trapped in bad marriages.\u000aWorse, a large percentage of teenage marriages qualify as forced marriages. Parental consent in many instances is a form of parental coercion. A forced marriage is a marriage in which one or both spouses do not consent to the marriage. "Force" in a forced marriage can take many forms including physical, psychological, financial, sexual, or emotional pressure or any combination thereof. \u000aFamily members exert emotional pressure in order for the teenage bride to agree to the marriage by speaking of family honor, stressing embarrassment or shame to the family and even threats of physical violence. Forced marriages are a product of parental and familial coercion. New Jersey law permitting marriage under the age of 18 with parental consent simply facilitates forced marriages.\u000aUnchained  a New Jersey based non-profit dedicated to help women leave or avoid arranged/forced marriages C found that in the past 10 years alone more than 3,000 teenagers married under the age of 18 in New Jersey.\u000aSuch young marriage ages of the past and even today may have made sense because of the then life expectancy, social norms and economic circumstances. They don't today, especially in New Jersey. \u000aA teenager unable to vote or legally consume alcohol should not be permitted to marry. A teenager is too young to understand the serious commitment of marriage and the substantial emotional, physical and financial responsibilities that come with marriage and starting a family. And the ability to form voluntary mutuality to tie-the-knot at such early age is questionable at best. \u000aIncreasing the marriage age to 18 years is a simple measure to prevent the long-term psychological, physical and financial devastation that so many teenage brides suffer. Young New Jersey girls need protection from their na?ve selves and from their good intentioned parents. New Jersey legislators should step up and schedule A3091 for an Assembly vote immediately.

VPresident-elect Donald Trump heavily out-campaigned his Democratic opponent in the last 100 days of the election, spending roughly 50 percent more time in six key battleground states that pushed him to victory on Nov. 8. \u000a Over the final 100 days of the election, Trump made a total of 133 visits to Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin. Over the same time period, Hillary Clinton visited the first five of those states a total of 87 times. She never traveled to Wisconsin during the 102 days between the convention and the election. \u000aDonald Trump owes his victory to no one, analyst says\u000a Instead, Clinton sent her top surrogates to Wisconsin including her running mate Sen. Tim Kaine, her daughter Chelsea Clinton and her primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Trump ended up winning Wisconsin by 1 point, the first time a Republican presidential candidate has triumphed there since 1984. \u000a Other top Clinton surrogates  most notably President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden  traveled constantly for the Democratic nominee in the closing weeks, allowing the Clinton campaign to stretch resources and focus the candidate on fundraising and debate preparations. \u000a On a call with donors Saturday, defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton blamed the actions of FBI Director James B. Comey in the final two weeks of the campaign for chipping at her momentum. \u000a Clinton had been up, at times significantly, in national and many statewide polls following the Democratic National Convention at the end of July. She took time off from the trail in August to fundraise and prepare for three presidential debates while Trump moved from one battleground to the next, holding multiple rallies. She also relied heavily on political and celebrity surrogates while he hit the road mostly on his own, with few top supporters to call on. \u000aDonald Trump elected as president and more: This week's top news\u000a Yet it was Comey's decision 12 days before the election to renew attention on what had seemed to be a closed investigation of a private email server Clinton used as secretary of State that jolted the final days of the race. \u000a Then, with just two days of campaigning remaining, the FBI Director just as suddenly determined that nothing had changed his original announcement in the summer that no legal action was warranted in the case. \u000a "Our analysis is that Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum," Clinton said in a call with donors Saturday, according to a source who participated in the call. \u000a "We dropped and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage, which, going into the last weekend, we had. We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together," she said in remarks first reported by The Washington Post. \u000a That may be 1. But travel may have also been a significant factor. \u000a Trump out-campaigned Clinton by 30 percent in Florida, winning by 1.3 points a state that had gone Democratic in 2008 and 2012. \u000a In Pennsylvania, Trump made 23 percent more visits and won the previously blue state by 1.2 points. \u000a The biggest disparity came in Ohio, where Clinton made 17 stops and Trump made 26. He won the state by more than 8 points. In North Carolina, Clinton made 16 stops as Trump made 23, and he took the state by a little under 4 points. \u000a And in what may prove to be this cycle's most stunning 11th hour upset, Michigan hosted Trump 13 times in the last 100 days. Clinton visited just six times in comparison and, as of Sunday, was behind Trump by 47.3 to 47.6 percent. \u000a "When you win, every decision you made is suddenly brilliant, and when you lose, every decision is described as wrong headed," said Republican strategist, former George W. Bush White House Director of Communications and MSNBC contributor Nicole Wallace on Sunday. \u000a "That said, being in those states helped Trump cut through the largely negative media drumbeat and communicate directly with voters," she added. "When the margin is this close you have to assume that everything you did over the course of a campaign mattered." \u000aHillary Clinton's campaign now 'second-guessing' a lot of decisions, Chuck Todd says

VLower back pain can affect your day-to-day life. According to the Journal Archives of Internal Medicine people who started doing Yoga or some form of stretching classes are twice as likely to cut back on pain medications for their back aches as people who managed symptoms on their own. Yoga is a highly effective technique to relieve you of your lower back pain. Here are six techniques or exercises.\u000aFor severe back pain, it is recommended to consult a medical practitioner\u000a1. Forward Bend\u000aThere are many different types of forward bends, each with varying levels of intensity. In bending forward towards our thighs, we are flexing the spine. This both stretches and strengthens the muscles along the spine, shoulder, pelvic girdles, and legs. Abdominal muscles are also strengthened.\u000aPlace your buttocks firmly on the floor\u000aExtend your legs outwards.\u000aLean forward, head facing down.\u000aTry to reach your feet, with your hands.\u000aHold for 5-10 breaths, repeat as needed.\u000a2. Cat and Cow Pose\u000aThis helps loosen back muscles and is ideal for relieving you of lower back pain.\u000aStart by going on all fours.\u000aSlowly press your spine upwards as you move into the cat pose.\u000aMake sure your back is arched.\u000aHold this position for a few seconds.\u000aMake sure your shoulder blades are pressed back and your head is lifted.\u000aMove back and forth between these poses.\u000aRepeat 10 times.\u000a3. Child\u000aThe child pose helps elongate your back and is a destresser.\u000aStretch your arms out in front of you as you are sitting on all fours.\u000aSit back and make sure your butt muscles (not touching) are resting just above your heels.\u000aHold for 5-10 breaths. Repeat.\u000a4. Pigeon\u000aThis can be a challenging exercise, especially for beginners. It stretches your hip rotators and flexors, which allow for tighter hips that can contribute to lower back pain.\u000aStart in the downward-facing dog position, making sure your feet are together.\u000aBring your left knee forward and turn it out to the left, making sure your left leg is bent and almost perpendicular to your right knee.\u000aThen lower both of your legs to the ground.\u000aKeep your right leg extended behind you.\u000aHold for 5-10 breaths, and repeat as required.\u000a5. Downward-facing dog\u000aThis a great total body stretch that targets the lower muscles that help form your lower back, providing needed support for your spine.\u000aTo do this, start on your hands and knees.\u000aMake sure your hands are only slightly in front of your shoulders.\u000aThen press back and raise your knees, away from the floor.\u000aFocus on lifting that tailbone of yours towards the ceiling.\u000aFor a hamstring stretch, softly push your heels towards the floor.\u000aHold this position for 5-10 breaths.\u000aRepeat 5-7 times\u000a6. Upward-facing dog\u000a.\u000aThis opens your chest, stretches your abdominal muscles and also engages your back.\u000aLie flat on the floor, palms facing down C near the middle of your ribs.\u000aPress the top of your feet into the floor, while drawing your legs together. While doing this, lift your chest off the floor. Make sure you use back strength and not your hands\u000aKeep legs extended.\u000aHold for 5-10 breaths and repeat.\u000aFeatured photo credit: CureJoy via za.pinterest.com\u000aLove this article? \u000a Read full content \u000aNick Darlington\u000aNick is a Multipotentialite, traveler, aspiring entrepreneur, freelance writer, and blogger.

I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books  to be the first woman president for selfish reasons, the 25-year-old Tampa hairstylist continued.\u000aSmit said that shed never met Clinton, partly because she believes that side of the family looks down on her.\u000aSomething tells me the Clinton side looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but were hard-working, Smit told RadarOnline Wednesday.\u000aSmit first came into the limelight six years ago when she was just 18 and gave a heart wrenching interview to Inside Edition. At that time she claimed to be living off food stamps  one of the legacies of the Obama administration.\u000aHer life has turned around since 2010, and shes married to a U.S. Air Force meteorologist. She added that her aunts claim to be devoted to American families is a sham.\u000aTheyre not as good as everyone thinks they are, she said.\u000aHer mother, Martha Spivey, 50, who had a brief romance with Roger Clinton, agrees.\u000aThe Clintons are all talk! Spivey told the site. Hillary says shes all about family, but shes got a niece shes never met and never acknowledged.

VA teen girl in Florida facing the death penalty in the machete murder of a 17-year-old boy threw a tantrum when she was interrogated by police.\u000a Desiray Strickland, one of five suspects accused of killing Jose Amaya Guardado, ranted and raved to Miami-Dade police in surveillance video obtained by the Miami Herald.\u000a I did not kill that boy, I promise! the 19-year-old Strickland exclaims in the video.\u000a "All I want to know is what you were involved in," Detective Juan Segovia says, according to the newspaper. "You need to calm down."\u000aDesiray Strickland refuses to cooperate with police regarding brutal machete murder of boy.\u000a "I have not done anything!" she said. I'm not going to stay quiet!"\u000a Authorities say that Strickland had sex with one of the other suspects, Kaheem Arbelo, after committing the murder. Arbelo is considered the ringleader, according to the Herald.\u000a Those two, along with Jonathan Lucas, Christian Colon and Joseph Michael Cabrera, have been charged with first-degree murder.\u000aStrickland is one of five who could face the death penalty.\u000aJose Amaya Guardado was killed with a machette last year.\u000a Desiray Strickland (left) is one of five suspects accused in machete murder of Jose Amaya Guardado (right)\u000a The five suspects had plotted the gruesome attack for two weeks, digging a shallow grave and hiding the machete in the woods in Homestead. In June of last year they lured Guardado to the woods and ambushed him, striking him repeatedly with the machete. As he was dying, they ordered him into the shallow grave.\u000a While Arbelo, Lucas and Colon have confessed in video statements, according to the Herald, Strickland remains combative with the police, the video shows. At one point she scratched the message "MPD go to hell!" on a table.\u000a That's not very nice," Detective Segovia says.

VNASA's Curiosity rover spotted a strange rock on Mars, so of course, it shot it with a laser.\u000aThe intrepid, car-sized robot found an egg-shaped, golf ball-sized shiny rock that looked unlike any other rocks around it on Oct. 27. \u000aNASA Scientists controlling the rover suspected that the odd rock is an iron meteorite that found its way to the Martian surface. \u000aSo to confirm their suspicions, the researchers had Curiosity fire its laser at the meteorite. \u000aThe laser instrument (called ChemCam) has a specific scientific purpose. The instrument can decipher the chemical makeup of target rocks by gathering data on the types of light the rocks emit when hit with the laser beam.\u000aAccording to Curiosity's chemical analysis, the rock discovered last week is made of nickel and iron. In addition, Curiosity also found an iron-nickel-phosphide mineral that is relatively common in these kinds of meteorites, but rare in other rocks, according to NASA.\u000aA close-up of the Egg Rock meteorite showing the grid of white points caused by the blasts from Curiosity's laser.\u000aThese metal meteorites are also thought to be leftovers from the cores of asteroids floating around out in the solar system.\u000a"Iron meteorites provide records of many different asteroids that broke up, with fragments of their cores ending up on Earth and on Mars," Curiosity team member Horton Newsom said in a statement. \u000a"Mars may have sampled a different population of asteroids than Earth has."\u000aThis isn't the first meteorite a NASA rover on Mars has spotted. \u000aNASA's Opportunity rover  which is still roaming the surface of Mars  found another iron-nickel meteorite on the planet's surface in 2009. That meteorite, known as the Block Island meteorite, is 2-feet-long, but Opportunity also found another, smaller space rock on the red planet in 2004. \u000aThe Block Island meteorite seen by the Opportunity rover.\u000aScientists aren't sure when Curiosity's meteorite (named Egg Rock) fell to the Martian surface, but the rover's laser may help them figure it out. \u000aNASA will use the data collected by the ChemCam to figure out if the chemical composition in the interior of the meteorite is different from its exterior, possibly giving them clues as to how long the rock has been on eroding on the planet's surface.\u000aThe meteorite was found on lower Mount Sharp, the part of the Gale Crater that Curiosity is currently exploring. Scientists hope to use the rover's remaining lifespan to learn more about the past environment on Mars millions of years ago, giving them a deeper understanding of if and when the planet was habitable for microbial life.\u000aThe rover has been investigating the surface of Mars since its landing in 2012.

VTheres no pain quite like shame. Its sting is unique in the rich variety of human agony. The vitriol of anothers words shred our self-esteem.\u000aIts A Given\u000aIts no surprise that shame is the guiding light of dysfunctional families. Narcissistic families, like mine, thrive on shame and its close cousin, 0 guilt. Why wouldnt they? In their twisted logic, to destroy someone else automatically elevates themselves. I call it dancing on their carcass.\u000aIn addition, they take it extremely personally if an outsider, perhaps a teacher, incorrectly finds wrong in their child. It threatens their need to appear perfect to all and sundry, including through their childs perfection. Instead of coming to their childs defense and taking the opportunity to teach them boundaries, they inculcate more shame, teach people-pleasing and champion self-neglect.\u000aThe Raw Nerve\u000aFive years ago, I escaped the Family of Shame-Throwers. No one has shamed me for five wonderful years. I cant believe it!\u000aYet the nerve is still raw. So easily triggered. The least whiff of shame is like lemon juice in a paper-cut.\u000aTriggered\u000aLet me give you a real-life example of what triggered feels like and how the least thing can be a trigger.\u000aIt all started when my friend called at 10:15 one morning (in violation of my dont-call-before-eleven rule) and wanted to go shopping. That day just happened to be the day-after-therapy. I dunno about you, but Im an exhausted zombie after therapy. Opening my soul to a virtual stranger is so hard, so over-stimulating, so exhausting. To add insult to injury, I usually cant sleep the night after therapy. I was exhausted.\u000aI called her back and left a message, declining to go shopping and saying, Its not a good day for me. I needed to take care of me, and boy! Did I feel guilty about that! Enter Shame #1.\u000aAs always happens, my Me-Day turned out quite differently.\u000aI ended up helping the workers Id hired clear a rotten, felled tree off the road. As the great oak shuddered and fell my neighbor burst out of his house. Making a beeline across the road he approached me angrily with, What the hell are you doing? Mid-explanation he turned on a dime and stomped back to his house. I dont think he was quite himself. Usually, hes all waves and smiles. (To his credit, he came over the next day to apologize, peace-offerings and all. Everyone is entitled to an off-day. Heaven knows I have plenty of em, thanks to PMS.)\u000aWow! Oh, he was in the wrong. Dead wrong. But he triggered me. Shame #2. \u000aMeanwhile, while I carried firewood and built a burn pile from tree limbs, my friend called seven more times. This time, she wanted to go out for supper. Coming in to warm up, I waded through all her messages and hang-ups on my answering machine. And left her a message, declining. Hello! It was a bad day for me! Shame #3.\u000aGuilt VS Shame\u000aFrom my reading, Ive learned that guilt and shame are wildly different.\u000aGuilt is the prick of conscience from an actual, bona-fide, downright wrong-doing. The violation of a moral code.\u000aShame, on the other hand, is being bad as a person. Not doing something bad. Being integrally bad. A bad sort. A bad egg. The besmirching of the soul.\u000aConfusion\u000aAnd thats where the problem arises for children of abusive, dysfunctional and narcissistic parents. Our parents mingled guilt for childish wrong-doing with shame for who we were.\u000aPerhaps you too were told that you did bad things because you were inherently bad. As I recall, the exact phrase said with a snarl was, a sinner from birth. Im not disputing that we all are born with the ability to do bad things. But I believe passionately that we all know whats right to do and want to do it. Why else would we slither, argue and project when caught in wrong-doing?\u000aNow, as adults, guilt and shame are hopelessly intertwined. We cant feel one without the other.\u000aClaude Rains referred to this in the character of Dr. Jacquith in Now Voyageur when he advised a (0) guilt-ridden Bette Davis to:\u000aMingled Feelings\u000aWhen I declined to go shopping with my friend, did I do something morally wrong? Hell no!\u000aBut I felt shame, because Id disappointed someone dear to me. I didnt make all her dreams come 1. Instead, I chose to take care of me. And boy! Did I feel shame for it!\u000aWhen my neighbor got upset about toppling a dead tree, did I do something morally wrong? Hell no! \u000aBut I felt shame, just because Im programmed to feel shame every time another human being questions my actions.\u000aWhen I again disappointed my friend by not going out for dinner, did I do something morally wrong? Hell no!\u000aNumbness\u000aYet, I was drowning in shame. Not that I could exactly feel it. As I wrote in Therapy #6, thanks to PTSD, I cant really feel anything. But, intellectually, I knew the shame was there. And I feared it would come out as the secondary emotion of anger.\u000aSelf-Validation\u000aPerhaps the antidote to shame is self-validation.\u000aI always try to do the right thing, Doc, but I cant validate myself, I wailed to my therapist. I dont feel grown-up enough to self-validate. My parents were the adults. They said I wasbut they never acted like it. They owned me. I was good until I did the least thing they didnt like. Then it felt like they withdrew their love a l cult-like love-bombing to punish, to control, to get me back into line. How do I feel grown-up? How do I self-validate!?\u000aI wouldnt worry too much about it, he replied.\u000aHuh!?! Thats not what I expected.\u000aLike happiness, he said, self-validation isnt something you work towards. Itll organically happen as we work on other aspects of loving that long-neglected inner child. Every one of us is born with the capacity for both good and bad. You feel like your dad couldnt freely love you because you were a bad little girl. Were you really a bad little girl?\u000aNot A Bad Person\u000aNo, I whispered, my face buried in a soggy tissue.\u000aLike you, dear reader, I always try to do the right thing. I dont always succeed, but I always try. I dont deserve to feel shame. To feel less-than the rest of humanity. And neither do you!\u000aAlways remember, if youve suffered shame at the hands of a narcissist, consider it a compliment. There are umpteen articles online revealing how narcissists actively seek out nice people, good people, sensitive people, kind people to shame, manipulate and control. So, in a way, being the victim of a narcissists shaming is a back-handed compliment.\u000aYeah, I know, its a compliment we couldve done without! But what the heck!?! The next time you feel shame, just remember\u000aStop, look and listen. New England conscience on the track! Cute, isnt it.

VCredit: University of Maryland\u000aAt the site of a plantation where abolitionist Frederick Douglass once lived, University of Maryland (UMD) archaeologists have uncovered striking evidence of how African and Christian religious beliefs blended and merged in the 19th century. The team dug up an intact set of objects that they interpret as religious symbolstraditional ones from Africa, but mixed with what they believe to be a Biblical image: a representation of Ezekiel's Wheel. \u000a"No one has found this combination before. It may give us a snapshot of the blending of religious symbols of a tenant farmer after 1865," says University of Maryland archaeologist Mark P. Leone, who led the team. "Christianity had not erased traditional African spirit practices; it had merged with them to form a potent blend that still thrives today."\u000aFrom the late 18th century, Methodist Episcopal, and later African Methodist Episcopal (AME) preachers successfully ranged Maryland's Eastern Shore carrying the Christian message, Leone explains. They converted African Americans to Christianity, in part, by giving new meaning to traditional symbols. A powerful West Central African spiritual symbolthe cosmogram, a circle with an X insidemay have fused with Ezekiel's blazing chariot wheel. Uniquely, the discovered array contains both.\u000a"We call this the 'emergent wheel' because it shows the growing power of Christian imagery alongside the African," Leone says. "It shows us a moment in time when these symbols literally lived side-by-side."\u000aThis is the latest archaeological find from a decade-long excavation at Wye House, the site of a former plantation near Easton, Maryland. Douglass spent two years there as a child and wrote extensively about his experiences and observations. The new discovery helps flesh out these vivid descriptions of African-American life.\u000aTwo of Leone's University of Maryland graduate studentsBenjamin A. Skolnik and Elizabeth Pruittmade the discovery and excavated the deposit. They found it intact just below the surface where a tenant farmer's home once stood and dated it to 1865-1880.\u000aThe deposit contains a cosmogram-like figure molded into the lid of a canning jar, surrounded by a series of circles, and a wheelprobably the remnant of a small cart or barrow. Leone says the wheel was unexpected and that he had never seen one in a setting like this. After four years of inquiry, consulting existing scholarship and working with current Eastern Shore residents, he ultimately concluded that it represented something newthe image described in the Book of Ezekiel of a flying chariot.\u000aChristian preachers had discovered the powerful resonance the wheel image held for African Americans and over time, the old symbols took on new meaning as the church successfully reinterpreted them, Leone says. Current AME and Methodist Church members told Leone that Ezekiel's wheel represents God's presence among his people. Carlene Phoenix, a descendent of the Wye House Plantation enslaved community, still lives and worships in the area. She says the wheel retains its Christian symbolism and power, even today.\u000a"For me the wheel is all about the presence of God. He is omnipotent and is anywhere and everywhere at all times," Phoenix sys. "No matter what our ancestors endured during their captivity, God was there. For me the wheel was a reminder to them about the presence of God and the reassurance that no matter what we endure that He will never leave us nor forsake us."\u000a"Ms. Phoenix closes the circle for us in a way," Leone says. "The meaning has changed, but the old symbol retains its power."\u000aThis symbolism of the chariot wheels shows in the work of Ruth Starr Rose, a 20th century painter who lived within walking distance of Wye House. Art historian Barbara Paca, who closely studied and wrote about Rose's work, is credited by Leone with teaching him the meaning of the rusted wheel in the archaeological deposit. It signaled to him the transformation from African religion to African American Christianity. Paca is guest exhibition curator of: Ruth Starr Rose (1887-1965): Revelations of African American Life in Maryland and the World at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History \u005cu0026 Culture in Baltimore. \u000aProvided by: University of Maryland

VSadie Brittle was left devastated when she lost her first baby 2 months in\u000aShe only discovered she was carrying his twin 3 months later after having a ruptured fallopian tube\u000aDoctors say her heavy internal bleeding hid the healthy foetus in her womb\u000aTeddie was born via Caesarean section last Thursday, weighing 6lbs 10oz \u000aWhen Sadie Brittle lost her baby to an ectopic pregnancy she was understandably devastated. \u000aBut seven months on, the hairdresser has a new reason to be thankful - after giving birth to her lost baby's secret twin.\u000aMrs Brittle, 32, only discovered she was carrying another child almost three months after collapsing at work with a potentially deadly ruptured fallopian tube.\u000aYesterday, as she cradled six-day-old Teddie at home with husband Gary, 37, Mrs Brittle told how the healthy foetus growing in her womb had been hidden on hospital scans by heavy internal bleeding she suffered when her world fell apart eight weeks into the pregnancy. \u000aSadie Brittle, 32, from Tamworth, lost her baby to an ectopic pregnancy she was understandably devastated. But seven months on, the hairdresser has a new reason to be thankful - after giving birth to her lost baby's secret twin, Teddie\u000aThe second baby was only picked up nearly three months after having surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy, after Mrs Brittle carried out a pregnancy test because her stomach was still swollen.\u000aThe phenomenon, where a viable embryo is implanted in the uterus and the other implanted elsewhere - usually in one of the fallopian tubes - as an ectopic pregnancy, is known as a heterotopic pregnancy, and affects only one in 30,000 natural conceptions.\u000aShe said: 'I was devastated after my ectopic pregnancy in April.\u000a'I'd lost a lot of blood when it ruptured and I was told I couldn't work for three months.\u000a'We had a holiday to Spain at the end of the three months. I was on a sun lounger and wondered why my stomach was still big and quite high up, so I took a test.' \u000aHer surprised GP confirmed the pregnancy once the Brittles and daughter Summer, aged four, flew home.\u000aShe only discovered she was carrying another child almost three months after collapsing at work with a potentially deadly ruptured fallopian tube. Doctors say Teddie was being hidden by heavy internal bleeding in her womb\u000aThe secret baby was only picked up after Mrs Brittle carried out a pregnancy test because her stomach was still swollen following surgery. A hospital scan then revealed she was 19 weeks pregnant (pictured her hospital scan)\u000aMrs Brittle said there was 'no way' she'd got pregnant after surgery, and a midwife initially thought her symptoms were being caused by pregnancy hormones from the first failed pregnancy. But a hospital scan then revealed she was 19 weeks pregnant.\u000aTeddie was born via caesarean section last Thursday, weighing 6lbs 10oz.\u000aMrs Brittle, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, added: 'I was just so relieved that everything was OK.\u000a'I was a high risk pregnancy so had so many more scans than usual.' \u000aHer husband, a 37-year-old builder, added: 'I was born with cleft palate so I was just really worried.\u000a'It really was a roller coaster pregnancy, everything that could have happened, happened.\u000aTeddie was born via Caesarean section last Thursday, weighing 6lbs 10oz. The family were just relieved everything went OK and he is healthy\u000aMrs Brittle said: 'It was a birth of mixed emotions as he should have had a brother or sister' (Teddie pictured in a 4D scan)\u000a'We were trying for a baby at the time, but it was more a case of when it happens, it happens.\u000aWHAT IS AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY?\u000aAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes.\u000aThe fallopian tubes are the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb. If an egg gets stuck in them, it won't develop into a baby and your health may be at risk if the pregnancy continues.\u000aUnfortunately, it's not possible to save the pregnancy. It usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation.\u000aIn the UK, around 1 in every 80-90 pregnancies is ectopic. This is around 12,000 pregnancies a year.\u000a'We were so relieved when everything was OK with Teddie, but it was a birth of mixed emotions as he should have had a brother or sister.' \u000aAlthough rare in natural pregnancies such as Mrs Brittle's, the rate of heterotopic pregnancies in cases of assisted reproduction jumps to as many as one in 100 pregnancies.\u000aSymptoms of ectopic pregnancy - where a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb - include stomach pain, vaginal bleeding and pain in the tip of the shoulder. \u000aThey usually develop between the fourth and 12th week of pregnancy, although they do not always appear.\u000aIn the UK, around one in every 80-90 pregnancies are ectopic, according to the NHS - equivalent to around 12,000 each year. \u000aThere are often caused by blocked fallopian tubes, but in many cases, there can be no obvious explanation.\u000aIt is not possible to save an ectopic pregnancy. The egg usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation.

VAnderson Cooper and Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway got heated again on Sunday night when the CNN host asked if Trump was irresponsible for speculating without having any facts that recent findings in the Hillary Clinton email scandal would result in criminal charges\u000aAs usual, Conway danced around the issue, leading Cooper to press back, Youre not answering my question.\u000aIts irresponsible for someone who might be President of the United States to be, in your words, speculating about an active investigation when he has no actual facts, Cooper said.\u000aRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway listens to Trump deliver remarks about the Affordable Care Act at the DoubleTree by Hilton November 1, 2016 in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. less\u000aConway mentioned, everybody speculated about what the new evidence would reveal, though FBI director Jim Comey issued a statement clearing Clinton of any criminal activity.\u000aCooper fired back, If everybody jumped off a bridge, doesnt mean you should, too. Dont you think it is irresponsible?\u000aConway smiled, as if she was amused by the bridge comment, before saying, No, I dont think hes irresponsible.\u000aHe was one of many to speculate about why Comey did what he did, Conway said.\u000aCooper responded that people speculating were cable news pundits, not presidential candidates.\u000aDonald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway admonished a man who shouted "Jew-S-A!" at reporters at a Trump rally Saturday night and said she would have had him removed if she had seen it. That mans conduct was deplorable. Clearly, he doesnt speak for the campaign or the candidate. In September, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told a crowd at a fundraiser that half of Trump supporters fell into a basket of deplorables. They are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it, she said. Clinton later apologized and said she shouldnt have said half.\u000aThings also got heated between Cooper and Conway on Thursday night over Melania Trumps recent speech on cyberbullying, when the AC 360 host asked, If it is not okay for kids to do this, why is it okay for adults, for Donald Trump?\u000aIts really not OK for anyone to do [cyberbullying], Conway responded before Cooper shot back, Your candidate is the guy on Twitter at 3 a.m.\u000aRead original story Anderson Cooper Tears Into Kellyanne Conway Over Irresponsible Donald Trump (Video) At TheWrap

VA powerful senator is demanding FBI Director James Comey explain his decision Sunday to recommend for a second time against prosecuting Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information through the use of her private email system for official business.\u000aIn a letter to Comey, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., asked for details on Comey's scuttling of the latest probe, which had been triggered when a fresh batch of 650,000 emails potentially involving Clinton turned up in an unrelated investigation.\u000aRelated Image\u000aExpand / Contract\u000aJohnson, (l.), wants answers from Comey, (r.). (Associated Press) \u000aYour two most recent letters to the Committee leave several unanswered questions about this new material and the FBI's review of it, Johnson wrote in the letter sent Monday.\u000aComey called Clinton extremely careless in her handling of sensitive emails at a July 5 news conference in which he said he would not recommend that the Department of Justice seek an indictment for violation of the Espionage Act. The discovery of a massive new trove of emails, turned up in an unrelated probe of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., prompted Comey to announce last month the probe had been reopened.\u000aWeiner, who is suspected of sending lewd messages to a 15-year-old girl, is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide, Huma Abedin.\u000aJohnson wants Comey to explain his conclusions, given that the FBI found in its initial investigation that 81 email chains with 193 individual emails on Clinton's email system contained information classified at the time the emails were sent or received. The investigation also showed Clinton emailed directly with President Obama while outside the country, he wrote.\u000aA Sunday report in the New York Post revealed Clinton ordered her maid, who did not have any level of security clearance, to access and print classified information, and, in the process, entered the sensitive compartmented information facility in her home.\u000aDid the FBI examine these facts? If so, did the FBI determine whether this individual in fact had access to classified information? Johnson wrote. Did the FBI take into account these facts when evaluating whether former Secretary Clinton was grossly negligent in the handling of classified information?\u000aThe senator also asked how many new emails the FBI reviewed, whether any contained classified or top secret information at the time the emails were sent or received, and, if so, who had access to the information. He also demanded to know whether the FBI continues to examine matters relating to other current or former State Department employees relating to the mishandling of classified information or the destruction of federal records.

V2014 was a great year for WWE. It was a turning point for the company which saw Vince McMahon finally put his ego aside to give the fans what they want to see. Added emphasis was put on in-ring ability and NXT evolved from a simple developmental territory to a whole brand of its own. Individual performers had career making years. Brock Lesnar ended The Undertakers WrestleMania winning streak, Sting finally stepped foot in a WWE ring and Daniel Bryan captured the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XXX, though his jubilation was admittedly short-lived.\u000aHowever, not all WWE superstars had such a great 2014, and some werent even employed by the company by the time January 1st, 2015 rolled around. Over 30 wrestlers were released from WWE in 2014, which is excessive even for the companys notoriously fickle talent relations department. People of all ranks were given their marching orders during the year, from those yet to debut on TV to former world champions. Since then, some have continued their wrestling careers with other companies, while a few have closed the book on their wrestling careers.\u000aHere are 15 WWE superstars who were released in 2014 and where they are now.\u000a15. Yoshi Tatsu\u000aVia Bleacher Report\u000aMuch of Yoshi Tatsus time in WWE was spent floundering in the mid-card. His release from the company in 2014 took nobody by surprise, nor did his almost immediate return to New Japan Pro Wrestling.\u000aBack in NJPW, Yoshi began a gimmick which saw him hunting down members of The Bullet Club one by one, intent on ridding the wrestling world of the stable once and for all. In a showdown with Bullet Club member AJ Styles, Tatsus career nearly came to an end. While taking a Styles Clash, an infamously tricky move, Tatsu made the mistake of tucking his chin, which resulted in his head being driven into the mat.\u000aThe accident left Yoshi Tatsu with a broken neck and put him out of action for well over a year. Thankfully, he was able to recover from the injury and returned to the ring early this year to reprise his Bullet Hunter gimmick.

VDonald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre on October 24, 2016 in Tampa, Florida.\u000aDonald Trump made clear on Sunday that he is not giving up his role as media critic just because he was elected president of the United States. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to harshly criticize the New York Times for its coverage of the Trump phenomena. The president-elect then went on to mock an open letter that publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet wrote to readers after the election.\u000a"Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena,'" Trump wrote.\u000aWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"\u000a Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \u000aHe then went on: The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?\u000aThe @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?\u000a Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \u000aTrump was referring to the open letter to readers that Sulzberger and Baquet published on Friday promising that the paper would reflect on its coverage of the election. Did Donald Trumps sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters? they asked. We cannot deliver the independent, original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers.\u000aLetter to NYT readers from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet pic.twitter.com/jORqzx3BA9\u000a Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 11, 2016 \u000aThe Times was a frequent target of Trumps tweets during the campaign in which he never shied away from criticizing media outletsand often specific reportersfor their coverage of his presidential bid. Yet this latest attack came shortly after Trump told 60 Minutes that he will be restrained on how he uses Twitter. \u000a"I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained," Trump said in an interview that will air Sunday night. Yet he also said that social media helped him win the election and now gives him a useful tool to push back on negative stories as president. I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. Im not saying I love it, but it does get the word out, he said. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you in another network, or whatever, because of course, CBS would never do a thing like that, right? I have a method of fighting back.

VQuestion:\u000aWhich kind of milk is more nutritious: almond, soy, coconut or cashew? \u000aAnswer:\u000aIt varies based on the company, said Sara Haas, a dietitian speaking on behalf of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. I encourage people to be label readers. \u000aVegans and others may prefer to drink plant-based milks over milk that comes from animals for a variety of reasons. But in terms of nutritional content, a recent study in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition confirmed that plant-based beverages vary widely in their nutritional profiles, and the authors recommended that young children drink cows milk unless there is a medical reason they cannot. \u000aAn eight-ounce glass of cows milk naturally contains about eight grams of protein and almost a third of the recommended Percent Daily Value of calcium. Cows milk also naturally contains nutrients like potassium and vitamin B12. Cows milk is also usually fortified with vitamins A and D.\u000aNutritionally, the four plant-based milks noted pale in comparison. Except for soy milk, none of these milks contain more than a gram of protein unless theyre fortified. \u000aSoy beverages often contain as much protein as cows milk but no calcium (though many soy beverages are artificially fortified with calcium). Westsoy organic unsweetened plain soy milk, for example, contains no added ingredients, only water and organic soybeans; it has nine grams of protein but no calcium. It also has five grams of fat, compared to zero calories from fat in skim milk.\u000aOf the four, coconut milks may be the least nutritious, with no protein or one gram of protein and typically only small amounts of added calcium. \u000aWhile whole nuts like almonds and cashews are loaded with protein and almonds are rich in calcium, these nutrients are all but lost during the processing of these nut beverages, which contain a lot of water. \u000aTo boost the nutrient profile of these beverages, some manufacturers fortify them, adding pea protein or rice protein to raise the protein count, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate to increase the calcium, and vitamins. (Added ingredients are listed on the label at the bottom of the nutrition facts box.) \u000aBut scientists debate whether these added nutrients are absorbed and used as efficiently by the body as nutrients that are naturally present in foods. \u000aThe calcium in cows milk is inherent to the milk and may be better absorbed. Cows milk contains lactose and casein, which help increase the absorption of calcium, and calcium helps absorb vitamin D, said Sina Gallo, an assistant professor of nutrition and food studies at George Mason University. Theres synergy between all the nutrients; they all work together.\u000aThe amount of vitamin D in plant beverages varies, and a 2014 study of 2,831 children found that those who drank non-cows milk beverages had lower blood levels of vitamin D than those who drank cows milk. \u000aThere are other additives in plant-based beverages to consider as well. Ingredients like guar gum, xanthan gum or carrageenan are often added to enhance palatability and give the plant-based beverages a creamier, more velvety mouth feel. Some of these additives have been tied to allergic reactions or digestive problems, and the F.D.A. has warned against giving anything containing xanthan gum to infants. \u000aFat content, sugar and other sweeteners and calorie counts also vary considerably from product to product and may be quite high in flavored plant-based beverages, as they would be in chocolate or full-fat cows milk.

V(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\u000aThe latest ABC News/Washington Post, poll of likely voters in the 2016 presidential election showed something on Tuesday that has nary been seen this election cycle; Donald Trump with an edge on Hillary Clinton.\u000aIn one week, the two presidential nominees will face off in one of the most contentious elections in modern history. Throughout much of the campaign, both Clinton and Trump have been dogged by salacious rumors, allegations of improper conduct and the overall belief that they are both unfit for office.\u000aThe poll indicates that there is less than one percentage point between Clinton and Trump. In prior years, the ABC/WAPO poll has not always proved reliable one week before an election.\u000aIn 2012, the poll indicated that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney would beat President Barack Obama. The poll also indicated the Secretary of State John Kerry would defeat incumbent President George W. Bush.\u000aWithin the poll comes some more troubling data for Clinton supporters. As enthusiasm among Trump supporters rises, enthusiasm among Clinton fans appears to be dwindling.

VQ: My just-married daughter has informed me that we will no longer celebrate Christmas together because her husband always spends it with his mother and wants to continue doing it that way.\u000a When she saw my expression, she also told me not to look so hurt by it, because if her daughter (from a previous marriage) sees me upset, then SHE might get upset that shes not invited to go to California when my daughter, son-in-law and their daughter do. My granddaughter isnt invited because she isnt my son-in-laws daughter.\u000a Can you believe that? When I told my daughter that isnt right and shes putting her daughter in a bad spot and that the girl will grow up with a lot of resentment, she told me not to worry about it and it isnt going to happen.\u000a Abby, what can I do? I dont want to see my granddaughter hurt. Please answer soon. Christmas is coming.  Grandma Becky\u000a A: I agree that you shouldnt let your grandchild see how upset you are. Because geography prevents you and your son-in-laws parents from celebrating the holiday together, expect to make plans without your daughter in the future. That she would allow one of her children to be excluded because the girl isnt her husbands child is absolutely disgraceful. Her in-laws must be terribly insensitive to encourage it.\u000a Assuming your granddaughter lives close by, why dont you have her stay with you while her mother is away? The greatest gift is the gift of self, and that way, neither of you will be alone.\u000a Q: My parents have been divorced for 17 years, but my father appears to have trouble letting go. Some examples: Although he never wore a wedding ring, he does wear a widowers band, and he tells people he lost his wife. Recently, he talked to my brother about getting a tattoo of my mothers name. Suffice it to say, my brother told him it was inappropriate.\u000a My general policy has been to let Dad cope however he likes. I live 400 miles away and my brother still lives physically close to him. I understand that divorce can be traumatic, having lived through theirs as a child as well as my own. Is there any way I can help Dad cope with this?\u000a He is having health problems now. I think they are forcing him to confront his own death, but this has been going on for more than a decade. Lately, I find myself rolling my eyes and laughing it off. But privately, I worry this could be a sign of something worse because it appears to be escalating.\u000a Are there resources for coping with divorce? He wont consider therapy  Ive tried.  Worried Daughter in New Jersey\u000a A: While I have heard of widowed individuals switching their wedding band to the right hand, the concept of a widowers band is new to me. Your father may be ashamed that he is divorced, which is why he prefers to imply that hes widowed.\u000a I agree with you and your brother that the idea of him tattooing your mothers name on his body would have been inappropriate. I do think that you should discuss your concerns about your dads mental health with your brother because you say his peculiarities seem to be increasing, and he may need a physical and neurological evaluation.

Referring to the fact that these images are casual, i.e. you pin them up to a wall rather than frame them or keep them hidden away, they are associated with wartime during the 1940s and 1950s. A wide variety of women have taken the token of the pinup, some are models and others are actresses or other celebrities. If youve seen The Shawshank Redemption, a pinup of actress Rita Hayworth figures pretty importantly in the film.\u000aNowadays the idea of the pinup has also come to be associated with a vintage look. While this often goes back to the era where they are most popular, they can also encompass a wide variety of vintage styles up until the 1970s. With the advent of social media, it seems that pinup style and its variations (burlesque and rockabilly, in particular, have adopted a lot of the tenants of the pinup look) have spurned new stars and new industries.\u000aInstagram especially has been a great place for vintage fans to work on their look and trade their favorite companies and tricks. There are clothing and makeup companies totally built around pinups that have millions of followers. As pinup is really a wide-ranging term. Youll see everything under the sun when it comes to Instagram models strutting their pinup stuff C from detailed recreations of old styles to a hybrid of old and new.\u000aWhether you yourself are interested in embodying the pinup lifestyle or you just admire the hard work that goes into these vintage looks, here are 20 Instagram stars whove nailed the pinup look.\u000a20. @kirstiemydear\u000avia instagram.com\u000aWith jet black hair and a perfect hour-glass figure (reminiscent of the one and only Marilyn Monroe), Instagram model KirstieMyDear is a Canadian law student who has nailed a vintage look. Clearly inspired by the 1950s above all else, she seems to be channeling Betty Page and Ava Gardner. In this look she is creating her own interpretation of the classic Cinderella look and we have got to say it looks great on her! If you glance at her Instagram page for one minute youll notice that she does some really amazing versions of Disney characters, but also a lot of classic pinup looks.

VI have written a lot of bedwetting articles in recent days as a part of our sites Get Out the Vote Effort, an effort that around the office we are unofficially calling the Vote Or We Will Banhammer You Into Oblivion campaign. By using the same sophisticated algorithm that produces those incredibly obnoxious ads around the holiday season (we apologize, but we really, really appreciate those of you who tolerate them), we can track your IP addresses, match them to voter records, and not only ban you from the site, but from the Internet if you dont vote. Im sorry. We opted into the program before we really read the Terms of Service, and its too late to get out now. So, please vote. \u000aAnyway, many of those bedwetting articles have been focused on North Carolina and Florida, the two most pivotal states in this election. Putting everything else aside, what we do know with almost mathematical certainty is that Donald Trump cannot win without winning Florida. Based on polls and early voting, the state has looked like a toss up. In fact, according to raw, early numbers, as of 5:30 a.m. this morning, 21,212 more Registered Republicans have voted than Registered Democrats, and with over 4 million votes cast in Florida already, close to 50 percent of the vote in the state has already been tallied. \u000aA 21,000 vote advantage for Republicans in early voting is not exactly comforting, is it? Well, heres the good news: A William \u005cu0026 Mary Poll released last night polled those early voters, so in effect its as much an exit poll as a predictive one. Based on this poll of people who have already voted, 28 percent of Registered Republicans have crossed over to vote for Hillary Clinton. \u000aTwenty-eight (28) percent. \u000aThat is decisive. Better news still is that only 6 percent of registered Democrats are crossing over to vote for Trump. So, if we apply that exit poll to the raw early voting numbers, we see Hillary Clinton leading early voting by a 53-40 margin. \u000aThats a good number. That poll also predicts that Clinton ultimately will win the state by a 48-40 margin. Thats the ballgame for Trump. \u000aThe bad news, which is also kind of good news, is that based on that exit polling of early voters, Marco Rubio holds a 49-43 advantage over his Democratic challenger, Patrick Murphy. The bad news is that Rubio is likely to hold his seat in the Senate, but the comforting news for me is that exit polling showing that Rubio wins decisively means that its probably not a poll weighted heavily for Democrats, which suggests that the 28 percent number is solid. \u000aAnd if you think Im being dramatic, listen to Lawrence ODonnell. His voice pattern is human clickbait.

VThe new 'First Spouse.'\u000aDuring his live election special, Stephen Colbert got a NSFW "late-breaking bulletin," in his deaf ear notifying him of a live, exclusive interview with tear duct-less Melania Trump (Laura Benanti) from Trump Tower.\u000aWith words she wrote herself or borrowed from I Will Survive, We Didn't Start the Fire, and Taco Bell, the "First Spouse" for 2017 addressed many topics, including the photo where it appeared president-elect Donald Trump was confirming her vote at the polls. She also expressed her gratitude to "the man whose vision drove our entire campaign," Russian president Vladimir Putin and her "slightly older sister" Ivanka Trump.\u000a"Finally, I want to remind you of my husband's message," Benanti's Melania began, "that we should honor the vision of our founders and make America great again for rich, white, land-owning men with funny-looking wigs."\u000aSee the full skit in the clip above.

I made a mistake.'\u000aMystery man: Taking to Instagram on Sunday, the former Miss Great Britain shared a snap alongside a mystery man, seeming to confirm the end of her single status

VGetty Image\u000aPer an invitation from President Barack Obama, President-elect Donald Trump visited the White House on Thursday for a first meeting between the two since Tuesdays election. Their meeting, which follows Obamas public congratulations for the the Republican nominee on Wednesday, falls within a tradition thats almost as old as the office itself.

However, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, another one of these White House traditions  a photo-op of the current and future First Couples  wont be happening today.\u000aPer the Wall Street Journal, the Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. No reason was provided as to why this is the case, which is worrisome since the photo-op was something Barack and Michelle both participated in the matter back in 2008 with the Bush family:\u000aUnfortunately, since no reason was given for the photo-ops cancellation, we may never know exactly why the Obamas and the Trumps didnt take a photo together on Thursday. However, its hard not imagine that Obamas decision not to pose with the Trumps may have something to do with what the president called the pretty significant differences between himself and the Republican nominee. Obama even joked about not preparing for this very meeting during his Real Time interview with Bill Maher.

VEggs are a household staple, yet so misunderstood! From extending an egg's shelf-life to cooking a perfectly poached egg to discovering the easiest way to whip up eggs for a crowd, allow these 12 egg hacks to completely transform the way you handle this key ingredient.\u000aSink an egg in a glass of water to see if it's still fresh.\u000aEggs last a long time (we're talking weeks), but if you're worried that your egg has spoiled, carefully sink it in a glass of water. If it goes straight to the bottom, you're good! However, if the sucker floats (and bobs like an apple), toss it out.\u000aFreeze your eggs in a muffin tin.\u000aFresh eggs will last about five weeks in the fridge but up to six months in the freezer! The simplest way to freeze eggs is by dividing them in a muffin tin. Freeze until they are solid, transfer to a resealable freezer-safe plastic bag, and store until you're ready to use.\u000aScramble eggs like a chef.\u000aHow do you achieve evenly cooked, custardy scrambled eggs? Professionally trained chefs keep the heat at medium. They use one hand to slightly shake the pan in a circular motion. Simultaneously, the other hand (holding a spatula) stirs the eggs continuously in the opposite direction until the eggs set.\u000aIf time isn't on your side in the a.m., try microwaving your eggs. It only takes a little over a minute to zap up two eggs.\u000aTurn an egg wash into scrambled eggs.\u000aEgg wash has a myriad of baking uses, but usually you only need about a tablespoon's worth. Instead of tossing it out, whisk in extra eggs, a splash of cream, and a pinch of salt; then scramble it up for breakfast.\u000aAdd leftover egg yolks to your morning scramble.\u000aTrust. Adding leftover egg yolks to your scramble instantly provides extra flavor and richness (not to mention protein and nutrition). It's the easiest way to "get rid" of them without tossing them all together.\u000aWhen frying eggs, separate the whites and the yolk.\u000aIt sounds crazy, but try it! The next time you are frying an egg, separate the white and cook it first until it turns white and opaque. Then, add the egg yolk and cook it for a few minutes more. This will ensure the whites are thoroughly cooked while the yolk remains runny!\u000aHardboil eggs in a coffee pot.\u000aEspecially if you're living in a dorm room with no stove or hot pan, use a coffee pot to hard (or soft) boil your eggs.\u000aAlways poach the freshest eggs possible.\u000aWhat's the secret to perfectly poached eggs? For starters, it's all about using the freshest possible eggs. With older eggs, the whites become looser and fall away from the yolk, resulting in a messy, non-cohesive mass that's harder to poach. However, if you end up using slightly older eggs, before poaching them, drain off the loose egg white through a fine mesh strainer set over the sink.\u000aReheat a poached egg with a thermos.\u000aWant a poached egg for lunch? Pack the cooked eggs in a thermos filled with cool water. When you're ready to enjoy it, pour out the cold water, refill the thermos with hot water, and let the egg sit for about 2-3 minutes. Drain off the hot water then enjoy the egg on toast or on a salad.\u000aFeed a crowd with ham and egg cups.\u000aIf you're planning to feed a crowd, use a muffin tin to make these ham cups filled with eggs and cheese. The ham crisps up nicely yet the yolk remains runny.\u000aMeal plan with a muffin tin.\u000aIf you're trying to feed the family for a week, consider these baked eggs in a muffin tin. Choose your add-ins (it can be as simple as cheese), and bake until the eggs set. The eggs will last about a week and can be easily reheated in the microwave.

Lakers game with fellow model Bella Hadid and the elder Jenner sister dressed to the nines to cheer on one of her favorite teams.\u000aThe 21-year-old, who recently rang in the milestone birthday with plenty of glitter and skin  la Paris Hilton, showed off her legs for days in a pair of tiny denim Daisy Dukes and light green shin-length heels. The Victoria's Secret model stuck to her her cool-girl style M.O. and opted to display her tiny midriff in a gray crop top T-shirt, a cropped puffy green bomber, and an elaborate midriff chain that extended from her neckline to her shorts.\u000aA small monogrammed Gucci side bag and a messy ponytail topped off the brunette stunner's courtside appearance.\u000aMeanwhile, newly inducted VS model Hadid matched her friend in a pair of black cutoff shorts and a similarly messy updo. The 20-year-old went for an all-black look, choosing a black graphic T-shirt, a black corset belt, and shiny black Christian Louboutin heels for the evening.\u000aNow that's some winning court style!

VBefore I discovered Pilates, I wasn't very good at exercise. I pushed weights, jumped over steps, grunted through body pump classesyou name it, I tried it. And I got no results. \u000aI blamed my lack of success not only on my "genetics but also on the fitness methods that seemed to always fail me, no matter how much time and effort I put into them.\u000aWhen I discovered Pilates and learned how to exercise with skill, my body experienced a massive transformation. I became leaner, longer, faster, and more powerful, and I loved it. I believed I had found the right exercise for my body type and rejected those fitness regimes that had yielded me so little.\u000aI became certified and taught Pilates for a dedicated 15 years, honing my skills as I harnessed a masterful level of body control for both myself and my clients.\u000aAfter many loyal years as a Pilates instructor, I moved to a new city and struggled to find a Pilates studio to call home. In my own practice, I was going through the motions during class, feeling burnt out and uninspired, and that scared me. The fitness method that had literally changed my life was no longer "my everything." I knew I needed a change and that I had to take a risk and turn back to those fitness methods that were a source of such deep frustration so many years ago.\u000aTaking a leap of faith, I signed up for an early morning bootcamp program. On my first day, we began with a 10-minute run, 20 jumping jacks, 20 mountain climbers, 10 cherry pickers, and 10 push-ups. We repeated the series two more times then launched into a blistering upper-body routine, each shoulder set framed by a 200-yard sprint.\u000aHeart racing and eyes tearing, I suddenly realized something: I'm actually enjoying this.\u000aGetting out of my comfort zone taught me three things:\u000a1. Bootcamp means community.\u000aPeople of all ages, fitness levels, and genders attend bootcamp classes. These are men and women highly committed to their health and their fellow comrades, working hard together as a community. My early morning classes feel like a team effort, with everyone's positive energy pushing me to go the distance. Mind/body exercise can often be deeply internal, so it's exciting to get out of my own head and become part of a supportive, seriously dedicated troop.\u000a2. Bootcamp hasn't changedI have.\u000aThe exercises in bootcamp aren't unfamiliar. But this time around, I perform them differently. I engage my core muscles, I breathe deeply and consciously to keep my blood flowing, I stabilize my shoulders and hips before launching into military presses or jump-squats, and I rest when my body barks too loudly.\u000aBootcamp wasn't wrong for me all alongI had just been doing it wrong. \u000aPilates taught me that any exercise is an external vessel only, and the important stuff happens on the inside. We must fill an exercise with internal form: intention, precision, breath, control, and flow. Only then will we earn real results.\u000aWith my mind/body principles as a foundation, I am comfortable performing dynamic, explosive movements without feeling out of control or at risk of injury. I have crossed a threshold of skill that helps me enjoy a form of fitness that had been such a frustration so many years ago. \u000a3. Judgment hurts the judge.\u000aMy bias against bootcamp first emerged from ignorance but was soon scaffolded by arrogance. After I found Pilates, I looked down on traditional fitness forms and judged people who liked them, exalting myself as a more intelligent and mindful mover. I was an obnoxious mind/body snob!\u000aI am grateful to have had the opportunity to come back to my beginner's mind, to open myself up to the possibility that I can experience things in a new way and with a fresh perspective. I am grateful for my bootcamp teachers and the men and women who meet me out on the field at 5:30 a.m., their presence reminding me that "we're in this together." I am grateful to learn again (and again) that in order to grow and change, we must leave judgment behind.

VIt has just emerged that American doctors have developed a cream to ward off skin cancer. The magic ingredient is green tea, which is well known for its cancer-fighting properties. Natural antioxidants called polyphenols in the tea help block the growth of skin cancer cells. In fact, green tea has a whole host of other health benefits. Here, femail.co.uk investigates why it's the healthiest cuppa you can drink. {4} \u000a Green tea helps burn fat It can help speed up the metabolic rate because its antioxidant effect helps the liver to function more efficiently. \u000aA recent U.S. study of overweight men found that, with no other changes to their diet or exercise regimes, drinking green tea three times a day burned up 200 extra calories a day. The green tea drinkers also found that their energy levels were greatly increased. \u000a  Green tea protects against heart disease It has been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, because its potent antioxidant effects inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in the arteries. \u000aThe formation of abnormal blood clots (thrombosis) is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke, and green tea has been shown to inhibit abnormal blood clot formation as effectively as aspirin. \u000a Green tea can help lower blood pressure A major cause of hypertension (high blood pressure) is an enzyme secreted by the kidneys called angiotension- converting enzyme (ACE). \u000aPopular drugs for hypertension act as ACE inhibitors: by blocking the effects of ACE, blood pressure is reduced. Green tea is a natural ACE inhibitor, and several medical studies show lowered blood pressure in animals and humans given green tea extracts. \u000a Green tea can help protect against diabetes When starch is consumed, it requires the enzyme amylase to break it down into simple sugars that can be absorbed in the bloodstream. \u000aGreen tea polyphenols inhibit amylase, and so can help lower blood sugar levels. High blood levels of glucose and insulin predispose people to diabetes. \u000a  Green tea can help prevent food poisoning As it can kill bacteria, drinking green tea with meals may reduce the risk of bacterial food poisoning. \u000aIt prevents the growth of dangerous intestinal bacterial strains such as clostridia and E. coli and promotes the growth of friendly bifidobacteria. \u000aGreen tea can prevent bad breath Drinking green tea - which is a natural anti-bacterial agent - with food may help kill the oral bacteria that cause cavities and bad breath. \u000a Green tea guards against hepatitis Viral hepatitis is often triggered by high levels of iron in the liver. Green tea lowers iron levels throughout the body, so may have a direct anti-viral effect against certain strains of hepatitis. \u000aGreen tea can protect against cancer There is growing evidence to suggest that green tea contains compounds that fight cancer. The tea contains a compound called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which helps inhibit blood vessel growth. \u000a Green tea can help prevent arthritis A recent study found that antioxidants in green tea may prevent or reduce the severity of symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. \u000aAntioxidants in the tea inhibit the Cox-2 gene that triggers inflammation, working in much the same way as anti-inflammatory drugs. {3}\u000aGreen tea improves your immunity Gargling with green tea boosts immunity to influenza and flu, according to a study in Japan. \u000aResearch at Harvard University also indicated that green tea chemicals stimulated gammadelta T-cells, which bolster immunity against bacteria and viruses. \u000aGreen tea can protect against Alzheimer's disease A recent two-year study of a group of people aged 80 and over found that 96 per cent of those who drank ten cups of green tea a day showed no signs of cognitive impairment, compared to only 12 per cent who didn't drink green tea. \u000a Green tea can help fight allergies Researchers in Japan have identified a compound in green tea that, in laboratory tests, blocks a key cell receptor involved in producing an allergic response. \u000aThe compound, methylated epigallocatechin gallate, works by blocking the production of histamine and immunoglobulin E, two compounds in the body that are chiefly involved in triggering and sustaining allergic reactions.

VThis image is from lab-grown brain tissue  a minibrain  infected by Zika virus (white) with neural stem cells in red and neuronal nuclei in green.\u000aSome tiny clusters of brain cells grown in a lab dish are making big news at this week's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego.\u000aKnown as "minibrains," these rudimentary networks of cells are small enough to fit on the head of a pin, but already are providing researchers with insights into everything from early brain development to Down syndrome, Alzheimer's and Zika.\u000aAt a Sunday press conference at the neuroscience meeting, researchers said minibrains are helping them figure out how the Zika virus can disrupt human brain formation in the early stages of fetal development.\u000aMinibrains are highly organized structures that actually start out as human skin cells. They are then coaxed in the lab to become neural stem cells, then to differentiate into some of the different types of cells found in a real brain.\u000aWhat makes these lab-grown structures so useful is that they replicate part of the cell diversity and connectivity of the human brain, said Dr. Thomas Hartung, a researcher and experimental toxicologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\u000a"These cells are communicating," Hartung said. "These neurons are talking to each other."\u000aAs a result, the minibrains can help researchers answer questions that couldn't be answered by studying animal brain tissue. "We need human systems to tell us about humans, and that's why this is such a big step forward," Hartung said.\u000aThe first minibrains were developed a few years ago by scientists in Europe. Since then, researchers at a handful of institutions around the world have begun cranking out these experimental structures.\u000aAt Johns Hopkins, Hongjun Song has been working to streamline the process and make minibrains that are closer to the real thing in the way they respond to viruses, for example.\u000aWhen I visited Song's lab recently, he took me to a small, windowless room at Hopkins that has a powerful air filtration system, to show me the result of his team's effort. He opened an incubator the size of a dorm fridge and pointed to a device inside that was only slightly larger than a cell phone.\u000aThe device contains a complete factory for these organoids, he said; the system was built by three high school interns using a 3-D printer.\u000aThe lower half looks like a miniature muffin pan with a dozen separate compartments. "We can grow up to 10 minibrains in each one," Song said.\u000aThe top half resembles a mechanized Lego project. A small motor powers gears connected to a dozen plastic shafts. They gently stir a precise mixture of cells, nutrients, and growth factors in each compartment.\u000aThe minibrains that emerge after several months in the incubator are barely big enough to see with the naked eye, said Dr. Guo-Li Ming, a professor of neurology at Hopkins who is married to Song and collaborates with him on this research.\u000a"It's basically like a ball of cells clustering together," she said. "But if you open it up you really see something very similar to the early embryonic brain."\u000aThough it has only a tiny fraction of the number of cells of an actual brain, a minibrain grows much the way a real brain does during early pregnancy. And that has helped researchers solve a medical mystery involving the Zika virus.\u000aWhen Zika began making headlines last year, scientists suspected the virus could interfere with brain development in the womb. "But you can't study that in a mouse," Ming said, because mice have very few of the developing brain cells that are most vulnerable to Zika infection.\u000aA student suggested that Ming and Song use minibrains to figure out what was happening. So the couple contacted Hengli Tang, a research biologist they knew at Florida State University, who was studying the Zika virus.\u000aThat call led to studies of minibrains that showed precisely how the infection was attacking certain neural cells, especially at a point in development equivalent to the first trimester of pregnancy. "It was turning [these cells] into a viral factory," Song said.\u000aAs a result, the minibrains infected with the virus early in their development actually decreased in size, which may help explain why a human fetus infected with the Zika virus early in pregnancy sometimes develops into a baby with a very small brain.\u000aMembers of the Hopkins team are presenting details of their Zika findings this week at the neuroscience meeting, and are already planning minibrain studies of other disorders, including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's.\u000aElsewhere during the neuroscience meeting, scientists are presenting minibrain research as a model in brain cancer and in developmental disorders, including Down syndrome and Rett syndrome.\u000aMinibrains' greatest potential, though, may be for testing new drugs for brain disorders, Hartung said. Drug testing with animals has often proved misleading because animal brains just aren't like human brains, he explained.\u000a"One company after the other failed on things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, [and] also neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's," Hartung said.\u000aThose failures involved drugs that worked when tested in animals, but failed on people, Hartung said. So he has begun working with pharmaceutical companies to see whether minibrains might offer a better model.\u000aOne obstacle to the widespread use of minibrains in research may be public acceptance of the idea that scientists should be growing "brains" in the lab. But people would be less concerned, Hartung said, if they understood the differences between these very small, lab-grown structures and a real brain.\u000aFor one thing, minibrains stop growing when they still have only about 20,000 cells. A human brain has many billions. And these clumps of cells, he explained, have no way of learning or becoming conscious.

VWASHINGTON (AP)  The Latest on the U.S. presidential transition (all times EST):\u000a\u000aFormer President Bill Clinton has spoken to President-elect Donald Trump by phone. That's according to a spokesman for the former president and husband of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aThe spokesman says the former president congratulated Trump during the brief call on Thursday and wished him well.\u000a\u000aThe White House says Vice President Joe Biden talked to Mike Pence Thursday about the key duties of vice president and well as specific policy portfolios he has worked on, including the NATO alliance, eastern Europe and expanding access to the middle class.\u000a\u000aThe White House says in describing the meeting that the two men spoke in the vice president's office in the West Wing and that they reminisced about their friendship dating back to when they served in Congress.\u000a\u000aThe White House says Biden offered his full support to the vice president-elect to ensure a seamless transition to power and that he invited the Pence family to join him and his wife for dinner on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, which is where the vice president traditionally resides.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump has picked a longtime friend and private equity executive to lead his inauguration efforts.\u000a\u000aTom Barrack, who founded California-based firm Colony Capital, has been selected to serve as chairman of the President-elect's inaugural committee. That's according to two sources with direct knowledge of the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.\u000a\u000aBarrack has been an aggressive public supporter of Trump throughout the campaign. He was among the primetime speakers at Trump's nominating convention this summer.\u000a\u000aThe inaugural chairman is responsible for raising millions of dollars to fund the inauguration, which includes several major parties and an extensive entertainment program.\u000a\u000aHe told CBS "This Morning" on Thursday that Trump was like an ultimate fighter during the campaign who used "whatever tools necessary to convey a really disruptive message." He said America would see "a softer, kinder" Trump now that he's won the presidency.\u000a\u000aThe president of the United Auto Workers says the union's views on trade align with Donald Trump's, and he'd like a meeting with the president-elect to talk about it.\u000a\u000aDennis Williams says he agrees with Trump's call for scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has sent auto jobs to Mexico. He also backs Trump's proposal for a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe UAW has historically supported Democratic candidates and endorsed Hillary Clinton this year. But Michigan, which has the most auto workers of any state, narrowly voted for Trump in unofficial results. Internal polling of union members prior to the election showed 28 percent going for Trump with 6 percent undecided. Williams says Trump's total may actually have been slightly higher than the 31 percent who voted for Mitt Romney and 33 percent who went for John McCain.\u000a\u000aAs President-elect Donald Trump puts together his White House, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and top campaign aide Kellyanne Conway are emerging as possible picks for chief of staff.\u000a\u000aThat's according to two people familiar with the transition planning.\u000a\u000aConway, a prominent Republican pollster, served as Trump's third campaign chief of staff and developed a strong rapport with the candidate. Priebus embraced Trump after his nomination, despite concerns among other Republicans, and worked his way into his inner circle.\u000a\u000aA third person with knowledge of the transition process says conservative media executive Steve Bannon is also in the mix for chief of staff. However, others insist Bannon would not have a White House role.\u000a\u000aThose involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days.\u000a\u000aPresident-elect Donald Trump says his top three priorities are immigration, health care and jobs.\u000a\u000aTrump spoke briefly with reporters Thursday after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol.\u000a\u000aTrump is wrapping up his first trip to Washington since winning Tuesday's election. He's been meeting with President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan.\u000a\u000aWhen a reporter asked if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims, Trump said "Thank you everybody," and walked away.\u000a\u000aMore than 100 protesters are holding a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue as the president-elect meets with Republican leaders a few blocks away on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000aThe mostly student protesters are holding signs that say #stillwithher and Love Trumps Hate, a phrase that Hillary Clinton often used during her campaign against Trump.\u000a\u000aThe demonstrators sat on the sidewalk outside Trump's new hotel, chanting "Black Lives Matter" and "Stronger Together," a slogan of Clinton's campaign.\u000a\u000aTrump met earlier with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office near the hotel.\u000a\u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says he and President-elect Donald Trump had a "fantastic, productive meeting" at the Capitol.\u000a\u000aTrump called the meeting "an honor." He added that, "I think we're going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people."\u000a\u000aTrump may have signaled early agenda items where the Republicans agree. He said: "We can't get started fast enough, whether it's health care or immigration."\u000a\u000aRyan then took Trump, Melania Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence out onto his balcony overlooking the Mall. Ryan pointed to where the inaugural platform being is built. That's where Trump will be sworn in.\u000a\u000aTrump at one point gestured toward the tower of his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol.\u000a\u000aFirst lady Michelle Obama and incoming first lady Melania Trump have spoken about the challenges of raising children in the White House.\u000a\u000aMrs. Trump's 10-year-old son Barron Trump will become a teenager during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that's "a rather unique childhood."\u000a\u000aHe pointed out that Mrs. Obama and President Barack Obama also had the experience of raising children in the White House.\u000a\u000aEarnest said Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump spoke about the experience of being a good parent under those unique circumstances. He said the two women then walked to the Oval Office to visit with the president and the president-elect.\u000a\u000aFederal officials have imposed temporary flight restrictions over Vice President-elect Mike Pence's current home at the Indiana governor's residence.\u000a\u000aA Federal Aviation Administration notice dated Wednesday prohibits most aircraft from flying below 1,500 feet within a one-mile radius of the governor's residence in Indianapolis. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft.\u000a\u000aThe FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. Similar limits have been issued for around Trump Tower in New York City.\u000a\u000aThe notice says the Indianapolis air space restrictions are needed because of "VIP movement." They expire Jan. 21, the day after Pence becomes vice president.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump's first wife, Ivana, says she voted for her ex. She says he'll "make big changes" in the United States.\u000a\u000aIvana Trump offered the comment when reached by phone by her fourth husband, Rossano Rubicondi, while he appeared on an Italian TV talk show.\u000a\u000aIvana Trump is the mother of the president-elect's three oldest children. She married Rubicondi in 2008 and legally separated from him later that year.\u000a\u000aAccording to a news release from the "Maurizio Costanzo Show," Ivana Trump said: "Naturally I voted for Donald. He's a businessman who will make big changes."\u000a\u000aThe show is scheduled to air Sunday.\u000a\u000aHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, her former House colleague.\u000a\u000aPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that Pelosi congratulated Pence on his win in their conversation Thursday.\u000a\u000aHammill said: "The two agreed on the need to find common ground and that they would meet in person in the weeks ahead."\u000a\u000aPence served in the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana.\u000a\u000aPresident-elect Donald Trump has left the White House after his first meeting with President Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aTrump says it was the first time the two had ever met. For almost 90 minutes, they discussed the coming changeover of government. Trump said they had planned to meet for a much shorter period of time.\u000a\u000aWhile in Washington, Trump also plans to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000aAs Trump and Obama met in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trump's wife, Melania, to the White House residence.\u000a\u000aPresident-elect Donald Trump says he's looking forward to benefiting from President Barack Obama's "counsel" in the future.\u000a\u000aTrump was speaking at the end of his meeting Thursday with Obama in the Oval Office. He's suggesting he may turn to Obama for advice on governing.\u000a\u000aTrump said he looks forward to being with Obama "many, many more times." He said they discussed a host of topics.\u000a\u000aTrump said that Obama explained "some of the difficulties" but also "some of the really great things that have been achieved."\u000a\u000aTrump is noting that the meeting was expected to be short, but lasted almost 90 minutes. He said as far as he's concerned, it could have gone on much longer.\u000a\u000aPresident-elect Donald Trump says he "very much looks forward" to dealing with President Barack Obama in the future.\u000a\u000aTrump was meeting with Obama Thursday in the Oval Office. He called the meeting a "great honor."\u000a\u000aTrump noted that he and Obama haven't met each other before. Their meeting lasted well over an hour.\u000a\u000aPresident Barack Obama has met with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House. Obama said that they had an "excellent" and "wide-ranging" conversation.\u000a\u000aObama met with Trump in the Oval Office for more than an hour to discuss the transition of power.\u000a\u000aObama said he was encouraged by Trump's wanting to work with his team on issues facing the country. He said it's important for all "to now come together."\u000a\u000aLater, Trump will go to Capitol Hill to talk with congressional leaders about the Republicans' legislative agenda for next year.\u000a\u000aThe Indiana governor's office says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will complete his term in the state's top office.\u000a\u000aPence spokeswoman Kara Brooks said Thursday that Pence will remain in office until his term ends Jan. 9. Pence will become vice president when President-elect Donald Trump takes office Jan. 20.\u000a\u000aRepublican Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb won election Tuesday to succeed Pence. Holcomb on Wednesday left open the possibility of an early gubernatorial transition by saying that decision was up to Pence.\u000a\u000aPence was elected governor in 2012 after 12 years in Congress.\u000a\u000aA rally to welcome Pence back to the state is set for Thursday evening on the grounds of Indianapolis International Airport.

VAnnie Dookhan in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston, Nov. 22, 2013. (WBZ-TV)\u000aBOSTON (AP)  Its been more than four years since the full extent of misconduct by a former Massachusetts chemist became public knowledge.\u000aThe state chemist, Annie Dookhan, has already completed a three-year prison sentence for tampering with evidence and falsifying drug tests in criminal cases. But many of the defendants whose drug samples she handled still havent gotten their day in court to challenge their convictions.\u000aThis week, the highest court in Massachusetts will hear a request for a global remedy its already rejected once: mass dismissal of about 24,000 criminal cases in which Dookhan played a role in testing drugs.\u000aArguments before the Supreme Judicial Court are scheduled Wednesday in a case brought by state public defenders and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. The groups want the court to vacate convictions or other adverse results in all cases in which Dookhan was either the primary or secondary chemist on samples sent to the state lab by local police departments.\u000aWe think vacating these convictions is required to protect the rights of people who have already served their sentences and are living every day with the collateral consequences of those decisions, said Matthew Segal, the ACLUs legal director. Its also necessary to safeguard the justice systems integrity, which has been seriously damaged, not just by the scandal itself but by how its been handled.\u000aProsecutors are strongly opposed to the idea of dismissing thousands of cases outright. Instead, they argue, challenges should be heard by judges on a case-by-case basis, as they have been in Dookhan cases since 2012.\u000aJake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley, said prosecutors do not rely solely on a chemists tests to bring drug prosecutions. Other evidence can include surveillance videos of drug transactions, guns and cellphone records.\u000aEvery case is different and every case should be approached individually, Wark said. Our argument is that a global remedy is no remedy at all.\u000aThe SJC rejected a similar proposal for a blanket dismissal of cases in 2015.\u000aBut public defenders and the ACLU say that was before the full scope of cases handled by Dookhan was known. Prosecutors had supplied an initial list of names in 2013, but it did not contain specific information about criminal cases, Segal said. Six months ago, prosecutors provided a comprehensive list, he said.\u000aSegal said asking the courts to handle each of the 24,000 cases one by one would be impractical, time-consuming and unfair to defendants who have had to deal with damage caused by their criminal convictions, including difficulties finding housing or employment. The Committee for Public Counsel Services estimates it would take 24 years to assign public defenders to represent defendants in all 24,000 cases.\u000aThis is just too many cases for the indigent defense system and the courts to handle, Segal said.\u000aProsecutors, however, say that is a gross exaggeration.\u000aThat estimate suggests shocking dysfunction in the defense bar, Wark said.\u000aThere is now no pending backlog of Dookhan-related cases, and any defendant who wishes to file a motion to vacation or to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his conviction can do so in the ordinary course of business with no delay.\u000aThe state is also dealing with another lab scandal. Investigators say former chemist Sonja Farak was high almost every day over the eight years she worked at a drug lab in Amherst. Her case has put thousands of criminal cases in jeopardy.\u000aFarak pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and related charges in 2014. She served 18 months in prison and is now on probation.

VABC News Martha Raddatz began to choke up during the networks 2016 Election Night coverage when discussing the ramifications a President Donald Trump might have on the military.\u000aRaddatz, one of the 2016 debate moderators, sounded shaky from the get-go. Donald Trump, I questioned what he would do about Syria and his understanding of military policy and civilian/military divide, I dont know that he really has a plan for what hes going to do there, she said.\u000aI was also looking back at an interview [Democratic vice presidential candidate] Tim Kaine gave, she continued. Tim Kaine has a son in the Marine Corps. He was asked by CBSs John Dickerson, If Donald Trump is democratically elected,and your son is serving as a Marine, you wouldnt trust his life under that commander-in-chief? And Kaine said, I wouldnt.\u000aThats a pretty extreme thing to say; if you have a son in the Marine Corps, and that you dont trust the commander-in-chief Raddatz said, her voice breaking. The people in the military defend the Constitution. Thats what they do.\u000aWatch above, via ABC News.

VThousands of people in cities across Britain poured onto the streets this weekend to protest in solidarity with African Americans who have been victims of police violence. Black Lives Matter has captured the imagination of Black Britain, striking a chord in part because the situation in America is so appalling. The normality that police shooting Black people to death has become is something that we struggle to comprehend.\u000a The majority of British police do not carry guns, so there are very few deaths of this kind in the country. We are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers, a seemingly neverending reel of wasted lives. Social media has also personalised the brutality; providing horrific access to the inhumanity of police violence and the aftermath. However, the battle against police brutality in America is resonating in Britain not because it is alien to us, but ties directly into our experiences.\u000a Since mass migration of Black people into the Britain after the Second World War, there has been a difficult relationship with the police. This great migration from the colonies mirrored patterns of movement of African Americans from the South into apparently progressive northern cities. Also mirrored were the social relations, with Black migrants being assigned to deprived inner city communities. Poor housing, racist schooling and high levels of unemployment created the equivalent to the Black ghetto in the Britain. Instead of the hood, we call it the endz.\u000a In their seminal work on race and crime Policing the Crisis (1978) the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies broke down how Black communities in Britain became linked with crime and depravity. The British criminal justice system, including the police, courts and media essentially made up a new category of crime mugging that became linked to Black people. The result was overpolicing, harsher sentencing and a moral panic around Black youth.\u000a Just as in America, the fear of Black people was directly linked to the ideas Black inferiority and savagery used to justify slavery. Americas plantations were in the South, while Britains were in the Caribbean. When the Black subjects migrated to the Mother Country, they needed to be contained and controlled, with the police being on the frontline of that effort.\u000a Police harassment has been the source of many protests in the history of Black Britain. In the 1980s there were rebellions across the country, against the Sus Laws, under which countless Black people were arrested on the officers suspicion of having committed an offense. This trend has continued with Black people being up to 17.5 times more likely to be stopped and searched by police. The situation is so bad that it was estimated that the DNA of three quarters of young Black men in Britain are on the police database. In 2011, riots again engulfed the nation after Mark Duggan, an unarmed Black man was shot dead by the police.\u000a Police community relations are just as poisonous in Britain as America. We are protected to some extent because the police are mostly unarmed, however we are fully aware that if they did carry guns we would see the same levels of state violence. Even with a very small number of armed police there have been 1558 deaths following contact with the police since 1990 with Black people being three times overrepresented in deaths investigated by in Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Black Lives Matter protest in Birmingham, U.K. coincided with a march for Kingsley Burrell, who died in police custody in 2011. So far there have been no prosecutions against the officers involved, as has been the case with countless other deaths such as Sean Rigg, Smiley Culture, Sarah Reed, Cherry Groce and Demetre Fraser. The video of Philando Castle dying after being shot by police is personal to us in Britain, because we know that in other circumstances, he could be our brother, father or friend.\u000a In many ways the American situation resonates because it is a more extreme version of the racism that we experience in Britain. America highlights the problems of racism in Britain, by making them easier to see and harder to avoid. The Black unemployment rate is triple that of the white population in Britain, with 38% of young Black men currently out of work. Black people are actually more overrepresented in the UK prison population than African Americans are, but Britain incarcerates a fraction of the number as America. Because our numbers are much smaller (around 3% of the population), and Britain sees generally less violent crime, it is easy for these issues to be ignored.\u000a The spread of Black Lives Matter across Britain should not be a surprise, not only because the issues resonate, but due to the history of political connections across the Atlantic. Black movements in America have been a key source of influence and inspiration in Britain. American Civil Rights leaders are just as revered; Malcolms visits to the Britain are key moments in the British struggle and; the British Black Panthers left a considerable legacy on activism in the nation. There can be a tendency to view this influence as a troubling Americanisation of the British experience. But to take this view entirely misses the reality and importance of Black politics.\u000a Black politics is by its definition rooted in the connections to the African Diaspora, because Blackness is the unifying thread. It is that connection that mobilised thousands in Britain for events happening many thousands of miles away. The articulation of this politics in America is not nationally specific, but born out of global connections. Caribbean intellectuals like Claudia Jones, George Padmore and CLR James helped shaped the American scene. The Pan African Congress movement had its first conference in London in 1900 and drew thinkers and activists from across the African continent and the Diaspora over the decades, massively influencing Americans like W.E.B. DuBois. Marcus Garvey is one of the most important figures in Black American politics and he was a Jamaican who died in Britain. In fact, Garvey is one of the most central influences on Malcolm X, who went on to talk about a global Black revolution.\u000a When Black people in Britain are drawn to political movements in America, it is not a case of copycatting a foreign set of ideas. People are rallying to movements that have been created across the Diaspora that relate directly to their experiences. To adapt a phrase from Malcolm, these are not American politics, they are Black politics in America.\u000a As long as we continue to place Western nation state boundaries around our movements we will miss the legacy of Black politics. The most powerful form of organization is based on the organic links across the Diaspora.\u000a Black Lives Matter has emerged from a tradition of activism that ignored the imagined boundaries of nation and has tapped into the global connections of Blackness. As long as the conditions that have devalued Black life across the globe continue, solidarity will always exist against racial oppression. In Britain, American and across the Diaspora we have nothing to lose but our chains.

VA Northern California couple was out in their backyard walking their dog. The husband and wife spotted an old, rusty tin buried in the ground. \u000aWhen they opened the tin up they discovered 1,427 gold coins dating from 1847 to 1894. The coins were in mint condition. The bundle totaled around $10 million. \u000aIn a single instant, the pair became accidental millionaires. \u000aEach coin ranges from thousands to $1 million apiece depending on their rarity. The couple decided to remain anonymous to avoid people scavenging on their property. \u000aI dont like to say once-in-a-lifetime for anything, but you dont get an opportunity to handle this kind of material, a treasure like this, ever, said numismatist Don Kagin, who is representing the husband and wife. \u000aIts like they found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \u000aThe couple does not want their identities shared because they dont want attention or to change their lifestyle. They dont know who put the coins there but enjoy living on their rural property. They plan on selling a few of the coins to pay off bills and donate to charities. \u000aTheir concern was this would change the way everyone else would look at them, and theyre pretty happy with the lifestyle they have today, Kagin said. \u000aThe couples home is located where the California Gold Rush sprang up in the 1800s. The husband and wife walked along the same path for years before ever noticing the tin box.\u000aPlease SHARE this unbelievable story if you have no clue what you would do if $10 million fell into your lap.

VHillary Clintons campaign tweeted out a reminder to the public over the weekend that in case WikiLeaks releases a last-minute whopper around election day, that its probably a fake.\u000aIts probably a fake. The campaign and Hillarys supporters in the media have never claimed that any emails or documents released so far by WikiLeaks have been fake as a matter of fact. Theyve either not commented about it, or vaguely questioned their authenticity. Theyve been very careful with how theyve dealt with WikiLeaks revelations.\u000aThey dont want to come right out with blanket statements that theyre all fabricated. Then theyd have to provide evidence, which of course they dont have. Its a lot easier to just not talk about it, and when asked about it, say something like, We dont really know how authentic these emails are, and then segue right into Russian hackers. In other words, Were not sure that these emails are authentic, but if they are, its Russias fault, and Putin is trying to interfere with our electoral process.\u000aLast week, hacker group Anonymous and self-described internet freedom fighter Kim Dotcom had alluded to a last-minute bombshell leak. Apparently, the Hillary Clinton campaign took that information seriously and decided to try to preempt whatever information might be leaked with a disclaimer.\u000aFriends, please remember that if you see a whopper of a Wikileaks in next two days C its probably a fake.\u000a Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) November 6, 2016\u000aWikiLeaks responded:\u000a@jmpalmieri Biggest whoppers are those your campaign has been telling https://t.co/8NCYYfwRIV\u000aWikiLeaks will continue its perfect record.\u000a WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 6, 2016\u000aCuriously, the following day WikiLeaks tweeted out that their server had been targeted in a DoS attack.

VWhoopi Goldberg went off on a liberal rant in response to FBI Director James Comeys announcement Sunday that the new Hillary Clinton-related emails recently found included nothing that changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u000aComey announced in July that he was not recommending charges against Clinton.\u000aForty-four million people have already cast ballots, Goldberg said, referencing how many early voters who have already voted since Comey said the bureau found additional emails on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of loyal aide Huma Abedin..\u000aThe View co-host Joy Behar chimed in that a lot of people voted against Hillary due to Comey, but offered nothing to substantiate her claim.\u000aWhile Goldberg was none too pleased with Comey, she saved her ire for Donald Trump surrogate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who she claimed said he read the emails  two days before Comey informed Congress of the new emails, Giuliani predicted that some pretty big surprises were coming, saying he heard about it from former agents.\u000aHow did you see it when Comey hasnt seen it? she asked. I would say Giuliani was lying and it bothered me because what it did was it once again put a doubt in my mind as to whether I should be thinking about the FBI as yet another agency I cant trust.\u000aGoldberg said she wanted to think that the FBI is doing the work theyre supposed to be doing and Americans should not have to question that.\u000aBecause you got two boneheads who think because nobodys going to say anything because they say, Well, I saw them, and its like, no, dude, you did not see them. You didnt read doodoo.\u000aBut the real doodoo is her claim that Giuliani said he read the emails to the best of our knowledge, he never said that.\u000aTom is a grassroots activist who distinguished himself as one of the top conservative bloggers in Florida before joining BizPac Review.

These at-home bug repellants from Home Advisor are great home hacks that will keep bugs and harmful chemicals out of your home. All the ingredients are natural and safe to use around your family and pets, so start spraying away!\u000a1. Ants\u000aAnts are small and harmless, but they can be so annoying. Just one little crumb can attract a whole bunch and they seem to spread everywhere. To stop them before they even become a problem, combine water, white vinegar, and essential oil in a spray bottle and mist all doors and baseboards in your home.\u000a2. Cockroaches\u000aIf cockroaches send shivers up your spine, you need to make this pesticide before they even think about entering your home. Two cups of water mixed with two tablespoons of tea tree oil should do the trick.\u000a3. Spiders\u000aLet spiders know they are unwanted by deterring them with this fragrant spray. Mix one tablespoon of peppermint essential oil and one cup of water in a misting bottle. Cover all entrances to your house, including windows, to make sure your personal space is secure.\u000a4. Fruit Flies\u000aThese pesky flies seem to come from nowhere! We don't recommend cutting fruit from your diet so try this fruit fly trap instead. Stir together water and red wine vinegar in a cup. Then create a funnel out of a coffee filter and place it on top. Within a few days, the fruit flies will all be trapped in the cup with no way to escape!\u000a5. Mosquitos\u000aThe only place you should be worried about mosquitos is in front of the bonfire. Keep those annoying pests outside this fall by placing lavender, catnip, or basil near any entrances to your home.

VThere is nothing more shameful than hurting or taking advantage of a child. Yet every day, thousands of American children in the foster care system experience are abused and neglected at their most vulnerable. \u000aWhat is more epidemic are the scheming adults who take in foster children only to cash in the monthly paycheck. The average foster parent receives $713 dollars per child a month. \u000aWhen we treat our children like paychecks, its only them who end up suffering. In this social experiment by What Would You Do?, a foster mom explicitly favors her biological daughter over her foster son at a diner. \u000aShe tells him that no one would ever adopt him, that her daughter can have whatever she wants on the menu while he has a budget of $4. \u000aThe mother reprimands him when her daughter is misbehaving. She brings the young boy to tears. \u000aWhile this social experiment might be a reenactment, we know from the very real Lucci quadruplets who endured the same kind of abuse in foster care that this kind of treatment happens to foster children every day. \u000aEven in this darkest moment, its regular people like you or me who shine a light. One woman leans in over to the table and tells the boy shell buy him whatever he wants. \u000aShe asks him for his name and number to report the abusive mother. \u000aIf this social experiment proves anything, its that when we see children being harmed, we have the power to step in and make a difference!\u000aPlease SHARE this powerful message with your family and friends on Facebook!

VA recent episode of BBC Newsnight, airing Friday night (Nov. 11), highlighted a larger discussion regarding Emmett Tyrrell, the editor-in-chief of conservative magazine American Spectator, and internally acclaimed author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\u000aThe conversation was focused regarding President elect Donald Trump, with Tyrrell making a claim that Trump is not racist nor was he racist throughout the campaign. Adichie was quick to shut him down, giving a passionate and intelligible response to make her case.\u000aDuring the heated conversation, Tyrrell says that Trump "hasn't been racist," with Adichie interrupting him before he could elaborate.\u000a"I am sorry," Adichie fires back. "But if you are a white man, you don't get to define what racism is.You really don't. You don't get to sit there and say that he hasn't been racist when objectively, he has."\u000aShe then goes on to explain that racism is "an objective reality," and that "Trump has inhabited that reality."\u000aTyrell wasn't hearing it, writing of Adichie's statement to be a Marxist concept, known as 0 consciousness.\u000a"In other words, I can't even open my mouth here because I'm a white male," Tyrell says.\u000a"No, of course you can," Adichie responds. "I'm just saying to you that Donald Trump has shown us and has recently said things that are objectively racist."\u000aTo further establish her point, the Nigerian novelist brought up the example of Trump saying back in June that a federal judge's "Mexican heritage" would mean that he couldn't "impartially" preside over a case that involved the candidate. While Tyrrell pointed out that the judge Trump was referencing looked "his color," Adichie fired back, saying, "that's not the point. It's about what your candidate said."\u000aTake a look at the full interview in the clip below.

VRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the South Florida Fair Expo Center on Oct. 13 in West Palm Beach, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\u000aFor only the second time in a month, a new poll shows Donald Trump with a lead in Florida. Bloomberg's new survey, conducted by Selzer \u005cu0026 Co., gives Trump a two-point advantage over Hillary Clinton in the state  a state that may as well officially change its name to "must-win Florida," given how often that phrase is used in relation to Trump's candidacy. But it happens to be 1  and this poll offers the first real glimmer of possibility for Trump after a very grim couple of weeks.\u000aBut it's still just a tiny flicker of light somewhere in a very large, dark cave.\u000aThe details of the poll are similar to what we've seen elsewhere, with a few exceptions. Independents prefer Trump after backing President Obama four years ago when he won the state by less than a point. Hispanic voters prefer Clinton statewide, but in the Miami area give Trump a slight edge, likely thanks to older Cuban voters who skew Republican. (Younger Cuban voters are more Democratic.) A close race, and Bloomberg gives Trump the edge.\u000aThat's critically important to Trump's chances, for a few reasons. Here's how this result could be the first goofy step in a complicated Rube-Goldbergian path to President Trump.\u000a1. Trump closes the gap to take the lead in Florida.\u000aThis one result, the most recent poll in Florida, slices Clinton's lead in the state in RealClearPolitics' polling average from four points on Friday to 1.6 points today.\u000a2. Trump continues to close the gap nationally.\u000aAt the same time, Clinton's big lead after the third debate has narrowed somewhat, as you can see above. National polling correlates with state polling (predictably), so a closer national race should pull results in individual states in Trump's direction. (You can see that at work in this graph we made last week.) He doesn't need to be winning nationally to win the presidency; he just needs those 270 electoral votes.\u000aDoing better nationally helps him do that.\u000a3. Trump holds Utah and Texas.\u000aAny Republican not named Trump wouldn't even think twice about holding these two states. But Trump is Trump, and Utahns  particularly Mormon Utahns  are not terribly excited about his candidacy. In recent polls in the state, independent candidate Evan McMullin has out-polled Trump. But there's a lot of inertia at work in the political party system, and an outsider who's new to the process will have trouble matching up against the GOP's ability to mobilize voters while being unable to leverage traditional partisan loyalties.\u000aIf the national picture continues to look relatively decent for Trump, he can expect to hold Texas simply by virtue of the (R) next to his name.\u000a4. Trump holds Arizona and keeps his leads in Ohio and Iowa.\u000aRight now, Trump trails slightly in Arizona and leads slightly in Ohio. If the national picture continues to improve for him, he probably expect to hold Arizona (a traditionally red state) and to firm up those Ohio and Iowa leads.\u000aSo if all of those things happen  not givens, by any stretch  here's how Trump gets to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the presidency. (Or to 269, hoping that a tie would be resolved by the House in his favor.)\u000aScenario 1: Trump wins the states above, and wins North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In North Carolina, a victory is possible, particularly if the race shifts significantly back in his direction. (Right now, the polling average has him down by 2.) Pennsylvania's a different story. It usually votes for the Democrat in recent elections, and Trump trails by 5 points in a four-way contest in the state, according to RealClearPolitics. That's a big gap to close. If he does it, though, he gets to 279 electoral votes.\u000aScenario 2: Trump wins the states above, and wins North Carolina and Virginia. Virginia is even tougher than Pennsylvania. He trails by more than 7 points. If he does wins it and the state above, he gets to 272 electoral votes.\u000aScenario 3: Trump wins the states above, wins North Carolina, Colorado and Nevada. The already rocky path is getting rougher now. Trump trails in Nevada by 4, which is not too bad, but trails in Colorado by 6. Win all of these and he's at 274 electoral votes.\u000aScenario 4: Trump wins the states above, wins North Carolina, Colorado and New Hampshire. If he gets Colorado's nine electoral votes (in addition to all of the states above) he can win a smaller state to get across the finish line. He's down 8 in New Hampshire, but, heck. Win all of these and he's at 272 electoral votes.\u000aScenario 5: Trump wins the states above, wins North Carolina, Colorado and one electoral vote in Maine. Win all of these and he's at 269 electoral votes, and the race goes to the House.\u000aScenario 6: Trump wins the states above, Minnesota, Nevada, Colorado and that vote in Maine. You've probably noticed how critical North Carolina is to his chances. Take that out of the equation and things get even weirder. There hasn't been much polling in Minnesota, but Trump's down only 5 points there on average according to RealClearPolitics. So why not? Pull all of this off and Trump squeaks into the White House at 270 electoral votes.\u000aThis whole thing started by pointing out that a new poll showing Trump with a lead in Florida indicates that his path to the White House isn't totally closed off. If he wins Florida, he simply needs to also hold Texas, beat the upstart in Utah, hold his lead in Ohio, keep Arizona, win Iowa, not lose any other states Mitt Romney won, win North Carolina and then win: Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire or Colorado and one electoral vote in Maine and a vote in the House of Representatives.\u000aSee? A path to the presidency.\u000aAssuming that Florida poll isn't an outlier.

VThe USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) is underway for the first time conducting at-sea tests and trials on the Kennebeck River in the Atlantic Ocean on Dec. 7, 2015. The Zumwalt is the largest destroyer ever built for the U.S. Navy. (U.S. Navy/General Dynamics Bath Iron Works via Getty Images)\u000aPORTLAND, MaineThe new guns on the Navys biggest and most advanced destroyer are going to be firing blanks if the Navy cant find cost-effective projectiles.\u000aThe GPS-guided, rocket-powered projectiles developed for the new 155mm Advanced Gun System currently cost about $800,000 apiece, nearly as much as a cruise missile, making them too expensive for the Navy to buy in large quantities for the stealthy USS Zumwalt, according to officials.\u000aThe projectiles were supposed to be less expensive than missiles, providing a cost-effective way to pummel targets from 70 miles away, clearing a path for amphibious landings.\u000aBut the current price compares with $1 million for a cruise missile, which has a range of 1,000 miles. And the price is expected to grow, officials said.\u000aFor now, there are no plans to buy projectiles beyond the initial purchase of 90, according to the Navys draft 2018 budget. The Zumwalt is supposed to be stocked with 600.\u000aIts stunning news for a program plagued by growing costs.\u000aCongress is going to want to know how the Navy could get so far down the road without realizing that the price tag on these projectiles is so high, said Loren Thompson, defense analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Virginia.\u000aThe Navy is evaluating alternatives for ammunition for the Zumwalt and two other ships in the class that are under construction at Bath Iron Works in Maine. Those options include both conventional and hyper-velocity projectiles, said Navy Capt. Thurraya Kent.\u000aBethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin, which developed the 155mm projectiles, blamed the low production rate of shipsonly three are being built, compared with the 32 originally envisionedfor driving up costs of the guided munitions. The defense contractor is working with the Navy with options, a spokeswoman said.\u000aThe Navy has been struggling to reduce costs because of budget limits, but those constraints could be eased when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office. He has vowed to boost defense spending and to increase the size of the U.S. fleet.\u000aThe 610-foot Zumwalt, the first ship in the class, was commissioned into service last month and is currently en route to its home port in San Diego.\u000aThe destroyer features electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, and a deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors. The 155mm Advanced Gun System was designed by BAE Armament Systems.\u000aThe ships weigh in at nearly 15,000 tons, about 50 percent heavier than current destroyers. But the crew size is half of the 300 personnel of other destroyers, thanks to automation.

VAliens \u005cu0026 UFOs \u000aThere are those who believe that they have a way to not only contact aliens but can summons UFOs. Fortunately, they also have videos that allegedly prove what would usually be considered outlandish claims.\u000aThe most recent UFO summons occurred in Lansing, Michigan, when Derek Coffman decided to summons a few UFOs while meditating. According to the Daily Star, Coffman, a self-admitted paranormal enthusiast, summoned a fleet of UFOs. He was meditating outside his house when the first UFO appeared.\u000aIn the video, which Coleman originally posted to YouTube, Coffman can be heard saying, Show me some more, please.\u000aOddly enough, another light materialized and flew across the sky. In all, a fleet of six UFOs are allegedly summonsed by Coffman in the five-minute video.\u000aCoffman nonchalantly pointed out, While I meditate they always show up. He then said a larger UFO was on its way. We watched six or seven of them now and there is a bigger one coming.\u000aHe then admitted, A lot of people would say Im nuts C but they havent lived my life.\u000aBut there are a lot of people who might not believe Coffman is nuts. One of those people would be Scott C. Waring, the operator of the blog UFO Sightings Daily. He posted Coffmans video to his site and admitted he, too, had summoned UFOs before.\u000aIts really rare to see this many UFOs when a person summons, Waring wrote. Does summoning work? Yes. I have done it myself C but only a single UFO came.\u000aNot only do people claim to be able to summons UFOs, some have videos of the experiences. [Image by Photobank gallery/Shutterstock]\u000aWaring might identify more with the alien contact group from Australia that uploaded a video to their website wherein a UFO is depicted that supposedly was summonsed by the group. As was reported by the Express, the UFO hovered over the Melbourne-based contact group, called ECETI (Enlightened Contact with Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Australia, for a little while before exiting.\u000aWaring also posted the ECETI Australias video to his blog, making the comment that it was amazing. He then noted how the group made the summons.\u000aThey mentioned a Star Language, he explained, which is some sort of positive thinking and feelings of love so the UFO will come. As I have said before, UFOs often are equipped with emotional sensors, which are also useful to protect it as well as find those who are receptive to their appearance.\u000aECETI Australia, a chapter of the original ECETI group formed in Washington state, says on its website that its mission is to help with public awareness of the ET reality.\u000aThe group exists: To help and assist humanity to connect with the many other positive civilisations in the universe and where we can all network and address issues from poverty, to the environment, new technologies, food, health, happiness and well-being.\u000aSome claim to have the ability to summons UFOs, including Robert Bingham, a man known as The UFO Summoner, who says anyone can do it. [Image by Regele IONESCU/Shutterstock]\u000aUFO summoning has been going on for some time, according to conspiracy site Before Its News, and it is not as unique an experience as one might think. The site has suggested that anyone can do it, posting multiple videos of summoning. There also exists a video that supposedly teaches those who would want to summons UFOs how to harness the ability to do so. Created by Robert Bingham, who reputedly has the ability (hes called The UFO Summoner), the how-to video is said to offer insight and exclusive information on how they do it!\u000aIn the video, Bingham said he would like to make the public aware of is something that I have been privileged to C the technology of the ETs, their nano drones and how they operate around us daily.\u000aBingham also said that UFOs are often seen as constantly shape-shifting. He explained this as an illusion  something he refers to as morphing  presented by the operators of the crafts so the general public think they are balloons or other things that WE have up there.\u000aRobert Bingham suggested summoning came down to having an opened mind and the ability to focus.\u000aIs Bingham correct in the assertion? Can anybody summons a UFO? Or has he and some like-minded others deluded themselves into believing that they can actually summon aliens and/or UFOs? If so, how does one explain the strange videos that seem to support their claims? Are they hoaxes being delivered to the gullible? Or, finally, could the UFOs be coincidental, unidentified objects appearing after a summons that reinforces the summoners pre-existing notions?

VIts 1! Making your bed every morning improves your life! I used to be one of those busy people that didnt take time to make my bed. I was scattered in every direction. Every second of every day seemed to be a big deal. I was stressed! Here are five ways that making your bed every morning improves your life.\u000a1. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment.\u000aIt might seem too small to matter, but starting your day by making your bed gives you a sense of accomplishment. This gives you an instant feeling of success and the feeling that you are on top of things. You feel organized and ready to take on the day. This two minutes of work sets the tone for the rest of the day. It may be small but its mighty! Definitely worth your time.\u000a2. It creates a positive state of mind as you go to bed.\u000aWeve all been there. Youve had a stressful day and all you can think about is getting to bed. You hope you can get to sleep. You get to your room and its just how you left it, a mess! The bed isnt made and there are clothes everywhere. This just drops your mental state even lower as you climb into your messy bed.\u000aDo you recall how you feel when you stay at a hotel? You enter the room and its tidy. Right away your mood elevates and you look forward to climbing into the crisply made bed. You can create this mood and setting at home everyday!\u000aIt literally takes two minutes to make your bed. Even if you just make your bed and do nothing else, it makes the whole room look so much better instantly. Two minutes every morning rewards you with elevated state of mind every night!\u000a3. Make your bed, lower your stress.\u000aBy making your bed, you are starting to declutter your space. A decluttered space lowers your level of stress. You dont waste mental energy. Clutter is a constant reminder of how scattered and unorganized you are being. It drags your down. A tidy space is very calming. Who doesnt want some calm in the midst of our chaos? You can create your own calming sanctuary at home. You are in control of your own space and how it looks and therefore, how it makes you feel. Why not start with your daily bed making?\u000a4. It prevents embarrassment.\u000aIm sure its happened to all of us at some point: you leave the house in a flurry, you get home, and you have an unexpected visitor! You socialize for a little while and then they ask to use the washroom, which happens to be past your bedroom. Oh, no! Now, sure, you say you dont care, but I bet there is something inside that just nags with a bit of embarrassment. On the other hand, if you had spent just a couple of minutes in the morning making your bed, the whole room would appear tidier as the bed is the center of attention!\u000a5. It leads to other good habits.\u000aOnce you get in the habit of making your bed, youll crave a little more organization because you appreciate how it makes you feel. One day youll take a moment to look around your room and decide that it really wouldnt take much more time to pick up a few clothes. Youll spend about a minute putting away a few items and be wowed! That didnt take much time at all! Were only up to three minutes!\u000aThis feeling is so addictive it will spill into the other rooms of the house. Before you know it, you wont go to bed before the kitchen is clean!\u000aI subscribe to a very cool YouTube channel called Clean My Space, where I get so many amazing tips and motivation. Here is the bed making episode.\u000aIts hard to believe that cleaning videos can be fun to watch but these are really well done and youll be amazed at many of the nifty tricks!\u000aGo make your bed and feel amazing!\u000aTry to implement one or more together and youll get better sleeping patterns, deep sleep and body rest. 10 Tips For A Good Nights Sleep Without Pills\u000aFeatured photo credit: ?ole via photopin cc\u000aLove this article? \u000a Read full content

Massaro claims that she was sexually assaulted while visiting a US Military Base in Kuwait on behalf of WWE in 2006. She claims company doctors examined her following the incident and reported their findings to WWE executives, who then persuaded the former Playboy cover girl to keep quiet as they handled the situation internally.\u000aThe allegation of sexual assault is one of just several logged by the former Diva Search contestant, who is now joining an already established lawsuit against the media conglomerate claiming WWE concealed the dangers of repetitive head injuries that have caused over 50 former Superstars neurological damage.\u000aAshley Massaro isnt the only new addition to the lawsuit, which was already comprised of 52 plaintiffs, as the family of Jon Rechner (Balls Mahoney) have also joined the fight against WWE. Rechner, as previously note, passed away in April of this year from a heart attack at just 44 years old. Following his untimely death, he was diagnosed postmortem with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\u000aRechner is only the third professional wrestler to have been diagnosed with CTE, and is the first, via his family, to hold World Wrestling Entertainment legally accountable.\u000aThe road for Massaro and Rechners family is sure to be rocky, however, as just 24-hours prior to their joining the suit, a federal judge dismissed two cases against WWE filed in Connecticut. As previously noted, Judge Vanessa Bryant dismissed the families of Nelson Frazier and Matthew Osborne, claiming their deaths werent verifiably linked to CTE. Its interesting to point out that Konstantine Kyros, the attorney representing Frazier and Osborne, is also involved in the case now including Massaro and Rechner. \u000aMassaro claims shes suffered several concussions, including one that left her unconscious for five minutes during her tenure ending in 2008. She says she never received any care for injuries thatve lead to depression, anxiety, memory loss, migraines, and was told to shake it off. Massaro, whos now 37, claims her time with WWE lead to her subsequent drug addiction that WWE helped her get past in 2010.\u000aIn addition, Massaro claims she suffered: a hairline fracture to her spine; two herniated disks; an ankle fracture that required a five-inch metal plate; and a shattered knuckle on her right hand. Furthermore, Massaro alleges WWE chairman Vince McMahon ordered doctors to remove a cast from her hand weeks before it was supposed to come off, so that she could appear at an event that night.\u000aWWE attorney Jerry McDevitt chose not to comment on Massaro directly, and instead cited the WWEs motion for sanctions against Kyros Konstantine. WWE is expected to address the new plaintiffs and their allegations once McDevitt files a motion to dismiss the case.\u000aAnother former wrestler whos recently joined the lawsuit is Perry Satullo, AKA Perry Saturn, who developed a drug addiction that spiraled into homelessness when he was in his 40s. Now 50 years old, Saturn says he suffers from a myriad of CTE symptoms and is undergoing neurological care.\u000aAs of this writing, WWE has never lost a case involving a former talents alleged brain injuries, despite a precedent recently set by lawsuits against the National Football League and National Hockey League. The NFL reached a $1B settlement with a number of former players, whereas the NHLs case is still in litigation.

VThis news could not be a bigger deal, and it even eclipses the revelation by FBI Director James Comey that Hillary Clintons email probe has been reopened.\u000aFox News Bret Baier reported Wednesday night that the entire Clinton Foundation is under intense investigation by the FBI. The laptops of Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have in fact not been destroyed and are being reviewed. The gold mine of information that will come from these and other sources is profound.\u000aThis means that everyone from Hillary to Bill to Cheryl to Huma to Sidney to on and on and on are in fact under investigation. Any of them could be indicted, including Mrs. Clinton, since the central point of the probe is pay-to-play schemes related to the State Department and the Foundation. But who knows what else the Feds will come up with on this corrupt cabal?\u000aIts Greek, but I wouldnt call it tragedy. The Clintons greed has caught up with them, and if she loses, it will have cost her the election.\u000aAmericans, I think, will realize that by electing Clinton, they would not just be electing a potential criminal. They would be placing into the White House an entire criminal enterprise.

He'll start in Ohio and finish in North Carolina with stops in Florida in between.\u000aSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO \u000aPresident Barack Obama will embark on a four-day campaign swing tomorrow, lending his star power to one-time rival Hillary Clinton in the final days of her White House bid\u000a'We're not done yet. I've got one campaign left in me,' Obama declared at a Friday night rally in Orlando, Florida. He told his audience, 'Hillary needs your help. I need your help. America needs your help.'\u000aObama frankly told African-Americans last month that it would be a 'personal insult' to his legacy if they stay at home and allow Trump to win. \u000a'You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote,' he said at a D.C. dinner.\u000aThe White House said Monday that Obama 'poured his own blood, sweat and tears' into his economic agenda, a climate change agreement, the Iran nuclear deal and a host of other policies he's enacted.\u000aThe president 'spent a lot of hours that he probably have rather spent doing something else,' press secretary Josh Earnest said, 'talking to members of Congress about how to get health care reform done.'\u000aTrump is trying to 'tear all of those accomplishments down,' Earnest exclaimed. \u000a'I think the president would be deeply disappointed if his successor were to try to roll back and tear down the progress we've spent so much of the last eight years working to achieve,' he said. \u000aObama vowed Friday to work his heart out to elect Clinton, whose campaign had been derailed hours earlier by the stunning revelation that the FBI had gotten its hands on emails that could be 'pertinent' to her case. \u000aA vaguely-worded email from the bureau's director, James Comey, suggesting that the FBI was reopening its investigation at the eleventh hour sent shockwaves across the Oval Office race. \u000aThe sitting president avoided the topic entirely as he campaigned for Clinton in Florida.\u000a'I don't know about you, but I'm not tired,' he said. 'I'm feeling good. I'm ready to work.'\u000aHis spokesman said Monday that Obama remains supportive of Clinton's candidacy, as evidenced by his 'rather aggressive travel schedule' in the final week the of the national campaign. \u000a'That's what the president's focused on. I would not anticipate a significant change to the public pitch,' he said.\u000aA Donald Trump victory would be a humiliating slap-down of the first black president at the hands of a man who for years questioned his legitimacy\u000aObama's first stop of the week is in Columbus, Ohio. Wednesday he heads to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The following day he has events in South Florida and Jacksonville. On Friday he'll return to North Carolina for rallies in Fayetteville and Charlotte.\u000aHis schedule Saturday until Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 8, is blank.\u000a'Stay tuned,' Earnest told reporters today during his daily briefing. \u000aThe term-limited executive had a 55 percent approval rating on average in last week's Gallup surveys. \u000aHistorically, presidents have averaged 47 percent approval ratings this late in their careers, according to Gallup's data.\u000aGeorge W. Bush had a meager 27 percent of the country behind him as he was exiting office. Bill Clinton had a 58 percent approval rating in October of 2000, having recovered from a messy House impeachment two years before.\u000aThree years from the end of his White House stay Obama was a toxic politician, as well. For more than a year, the Democrat's likeability rating hovered at or above 40 percent.\u000aObama acknowledged Friday on the stump that he wasn't a 'perfect president.'\u000a'Ive made mistakes during these eight years, and there have been times where weve had ups and theres been times where weve had lows,' he said. \u000aBut he insisted that he'd done his very best for the country and pleaded with voters not to reject him and embrace Trump. \u000a'I said at that time that I wasn't a perfect man...I said at the time that if you elected me, we wouldn't solve every problem on day one. We wouldn't solve it all in one year, or one term, or even in one presidency,' Obama said.\u000a'What I told you was that I would work as hard as I could every single day to do right by you.'\u000aObama urged his base to turn out one more time, saying, 'Whatever issue you care about, youve got to vote. This is where democracy happens. This not where it ends - its where it happens, with your vote.\u000a'Your involvement is how progress is won.'

VPhoto: Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock.\u000aOver Labor Day weekend, Lena Dunham was slammed for her presumptive and prejudiced remarks about Odell Beckham Jr. during a chat between herself and friend Amy Schumer. Dunham has since apologized for saying that Beckham was uninterested in talking to her because he was turned off by her body type and outfit. But now, it's Schumer who is in hot water.\u000aThe comedian is receiving criticism for posting  and quickly deleting  a racist tweet on Sept. 2. Paulo L. dos Santos, an economics professor at the New School, tweeted the following in the wake of Dunham's interview controversy: "Lena Dunham, Amy Schumer, et. al. refuse 2C that misogyny among men of color, while hideously prevalent, is no more so than among white men." Schumer replied, "how would you know? Statistically who is hollerin at you in the street more pa?"\u000aAlthough she deleted the tweet shortly after, enough screenshots were captured and shared to provoke a backlash on Twitter  and rightfully so. Implicit in Schumer's tweet is the thought that men of color catcall women more often than white men. Her generalization is leading people to label the actress racist, ignorant, and hypocritical.\u000aPhoto: Courtesy of Twitter via Mic.\u000aThis isn't the first time that Schumer has been accused of racism. Many people find material in her stand-up routine to be insensitive at best and flagrantly racist at worst. Last year, a Washington Post op-ed calling Schumer out for racist jokes about Latinos explained that her "disparaging jokes provide a safe vehicle to share stereotypes, release inhibitions and spread racism." In a response to the outrage she dismissed her comments as jokes. It looks like this time, Schumer realized her words were inflammatory  just a little too late. \u000aAmy Schumer is a racist and has neverrrr been funny. Done. https://t.co/i1jORleuE2\u000a RIP #KorrynGaines (@meowsauce_) September 3, 2016 \u000aAmy Schumer is in fact a racist.

VThis is crazy! On Nov. 12, the fourth night of protests against president-elect Donald Trump, police ended up using tear gas on the crowds and making dozens of arrests after people shouted kill the police. Get the scoop on the rallies right here!\u000aThings are getting really, really serious on the anti-Donald Trump battlegrounds throughout the country as protests against the president-elect continue. Dozens of people were arrested in Portland on the night of Nov. 12, where crowds were throwing burning road flares in anger over the 70-year-olds election. And in Indianapolis, large crowds cried out in unison kill the police as they threw rocks at the authorities. Yikes!\u000aProtesters throwing burning road flares at police at Broadway \u005cu0026 Stark. Multiple arrests, diversionary "bang" device used.\u000a Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) November 13, 2016\u000aPortland has seen some of the worst riots since the upset results of the election on Nov. 8, with a man being shot and killed on Nov. 11 during one such protest. Now, officers have resorted to using flash grenades to control the protesters. Nineteen people in total were arrested by midnight on Nov. 12, with several more being taken into custody later. Portland detectives kept people updated on the situation via Twitter. Protesters throwing burning road flares at police on Broadway \u005cu0026 Stark. Multiple arrests, diversionary bang device used, they wrote.\u000aAnd while there are still cities throughout the country where protests have remained peaceful to a certain extent, like Los Angeles, locations like Indianapolis are dealing with protesters turning on the police. The backlash has grown rampant, with those who despise the businessman turned president protesting passionately for their cause, and even threatening the police who stand in their way. And it looks like things may not be calming down any time soon, as both sides of the battle are not backing down. In fact, a member of the pro-Donald tribe was seen driving a military truck through the crowds in Indianapolis with a Trump Pence 2016 sign. Oh, boy!\u000aHollywoodLifers, what do you think of the current protesting situation across the nation? Let us know below!

VThe 20-year-old Olympic champion has long been the victim of accusations and attacks online \u000aBut recently she decided that she was 'fed up' with the insults, vowing on Thursday that anyone posting nasty messages would be blocked\u000aGabby was previously criticized for not placing hand on heart during national anthem and was given the name 'Crabby Gabby' by critics\u000aGabby Douglas has simply had it with the constant stream of abuse she has received online.\u000aThe 20-year-old gymnast took to Instagram on Thursday to address her haters directly, telling them that if she sees any further negative comments, the perpetrator would be blocks. \u000a'OKK this needs to be addressed, I'm fed up and shutting this down,' she wrote. 'The people that want to be petty EXIT STAGE LEFT PLEASE. Honestly if you're gonna be foul just to be nasty or vile to comment I can help you find better ways to pass the time.'\u000aScroll down for video \u000aStanding tall: Gabby Douglas has hit out at online trolls online, saying that she will be blocking any haters from now on\u000aA real performer: Gabby suffered through cruel taunts online despite gold medal-winning performances in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games\u000aPutting it out there: Gabby shared this post on Instagram on Thursday as a warning to her less than pleasant followers\u000aShe added that if anyone is finding it difficult to fill their time, she would be happy to help them find some volunteer work or 'anything to help you become a more well-rounded, less obnoxious individual.'\u000aShe finished the post with the inclusion of the hashtags reading #Ifyoucan'tbenicepreparetogetblocked and #Hatefreezone.\u000aIt's partially surprising that it took so long for Gabby to finally ban her haters from her social media, as the cruel taunts were leaving her in tears back during the Rio Olympics.\u000aBack in August, Gabby's mother told Reuters just how badly the comments were hurting her daughter. \u000aTaking it out: Gabby vowed to block anyone who engaged in bullying on her Instagram page\u000aA hard fight: Gabby has been the target of abuse over everything from her hair to her facial expressions\u000aThe 20-year-old athlete had been attacked for not placing her hand over her heart during the national anthem at a medal ceremony - a gesture some perceived as a lack of patriotism.\u000aShe also faced criticism for not joining a standing ovation for two of her team mates. \u000aHer mother, Natalie Hawkins, explained how Gabby was heartbroken as bullies attacked her appearance, accusing her of being unpatriotic, and by mocking her with a mean-spirited nickname, 'Crabby Gabby', on social media.  \u000a'She's had to deal with people criticizing her hair, or people accusing her of bleaching her skin. They said she had breast enhancements, they said she wasn't smiling enough, she's unpatriotic. Then it went to not supporting your team mates. Now you're 'Crabby Gabby',' Hawkins told Reuters in an interview. \u000aMother's love: Natalie Hawkins (pictured at the 2012 London Olympics after Gabby won the gymnastics all-around final) defended her daughter in an interview in August\u000a'You name it and she got trampled. What did she ever do to anyone?'\u000aFor the second Games running, Gabby found herself caught in a firestorm despite yet another gold-winning performance in Rio.\u000aIn 2012 Twitter went into overdrive after Gabby became the first African-American gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. But rather than lauding her excellence, critics rounded on her for the state of her hair during the final.\u000aFour years on and Gabby has another Olympic gold, from the women's team competition, but the sheen from that victory has also been tarnished after TV cameras showed her standing to attention during the national anthem. \u000aStrong: Douglas was attacked for not placing her hand over her heart during the national anthem at a medal ceremony\u000aNitpicking: Gabby smiled during the medal ceremony for the artistic gymnastics women's team but kept her hands held together\u000a'I don't think respecting your country or your flag boils down to whether you put your hand over your heart or not,' Hawkins said.\u000a'It's in your actions towards your country, how well are you abiding by its laws, how well are you helping your fellow citizens?\u000a'We grew up in the military community. My mum spent almost 30 years in the military, my dad's a two-time Vietnam vet. Because of that it was so insulting that they would accuse my daughter of being unpatriotic when we are so tied to the military family.\u000a'When the Star Spangled Banner is played, most military members either salute or stand to attention.'\u000aBut Tuesday's furore over what the correct protocol is when the American flag is raised was neither the beginning nor the end of Gabby's problems.\u000aTelling it: Hawkins (pictured in 2012), who raised four children as a single mother, said her daughter had been left heartbroken as bullies criticize her appearance\u000aMore to go: Gabby has also faced criticism for not joining a standing ovation for her team mates, Simone Biles and Aly Raisman\u000aShe was also criticized for not giving team mates Simone Biles and Aly Raisman a standing ovation when they claimed gold and silver in Thursday's all around final.\u000aWith accusations that Gabby was angry and jealous at being denied a place in the final, since rules state only the top two performers from each country can progress to the final, #CrabbyGabby started trending on social media.\u000a'We've been brought to many tears because I don't know what she's done to warrant such an attack. To me it looks like she is being bullied,' said Hawkins.\u000aAll this unwanted attention on her daughter has been painful for Hawkins to watch. Despite being in Rio to cheer on Gabby, she is unable to give her a comforting hug.\u000aTeam rules limit contact to phone calls and texts until athletes are done competing.\u000a'What I saw in the stands was someone who was hurting and she was also angry,' added Hawkins.\u000a'What was going through her head was 'I'm being attacked for everything I do so I might as well not do anything. Because no matter what I do, I am being attacked'.'\u000aSocial media users nicknamed Gabby (pictured with team mates Laurie Hernandez, center, and Madison Kocian, right) 'Crabby Gabby'\u000aHawkins doesn't know whether her daughter is being targeted because of her race. \u000a'Many people are telling me that all the time. And that's from white people and black people. I don't want to believe (it's a race attack) as I want to have more faith,' she said.\u000a'But when I go on Twitter, I can't help but see that all the blacks are saying: 'Was it just the white people that are saying this against us?'\u000a'Maybe people are very frustrated. Our country has a lot of unrest and turmoil recently and people are frustrated and maybe they just want to vent and they just see someone innocent ... and bully them.'

VProving once again that to be a liberal means to be dangerous and violent in todays post Obama world, after a high school girl posted her support on social media for President Elect Donald J. Trump, a female student beat her up at school.\u000aJade Armenio, a sophomore at Woodside High School in Redwood City, California, noted that before Election Day she posted on Instagram that she hoped Trump would win the election. The very next day some girls at her school set up a vicious ambush and even arrogantly took cell phone video of the attack.\u000aJade noted that she had only joined in with all her friends who were posting their political views on social media. But the next day things took a violent turn.\u000aThis girl come up to me and said do you hate Mexicans? I said no and she said you support Trump, you hate Mexicans,' the victimized student told ABC, San Francisco.\u000aThe video clearly shows that Jade was attacked, thrown to the ground, kicked and punched. Jade told the media the attacker pulled out her earrings and yanked her hair. She was left with a bloody nose and scratches and bruises.\u000aThe principle of Woodside High School claims that the incident has been investigated with the assistance of law enforcement and that the appropriate disciplinary actions have been taken.\u000aJades parents, though, dont trust the school and are keeping their daughter out of class for the time being.

VNovember 10, 2016 - SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones issued the follow statement today regarding the impact of proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act: \u000a"Passage of the Affordable Care Act was one of the most significant changes in federal law in decades. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, over 20 million Americans gained health insurance coverage that they will lose if the law is repealed. Federal premium subsidies to help families that otherwise could not afford to buy health insurance coverage and the Medicaid expansion are essential to the expansion of coverage to over 20 million Americans. With President-Elect Trump and the Republican Congressional Leadership's "repeal and replace," those federal subsidies are eliminated as well as the other market reforms in the Affordable Care Act, which protect ordinary consumers.\u000aHealth insurance coverage saves lives. Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would result in the denial of health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions. Americans with employer-based and individual market coverage would lose access to preventative health care without cost sharing, which has helped so many people stay healthy. Access to preventative care would be undermined by the imposition of significant deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.\u000aWithout the Affordable Care Act, insurers can increase profits and administrative costs, reducing the premium dollars spent on actual medical care. Children would no longer be able to stay on their parents' insurance policies until the age of 26, and like everyone else, anyone could be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Americans don't want to go back to a time when health insurance could be denied based on pre-existing conditions, policies were rescinded when people fell ill, benefit packages failed to cover many essential health benefits and there were annual and lifetime limits on coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurers could often prevent people from having coverage when they needed it most.\u000aWith "repeal and replace" there is no soft landing. States do not have the financial capacity to backfill the proposed federal cuts to health insurance subsidies. Over 20 Million Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. \u000aIn California, the Affordable Care Act has enabled us to provide health insurance to 5.5 million additional Californians through the Medicaid expansion and another 1.4 million Californians have health insurance through our exchange, Covered California, of which 90 percent receive a reduced premium thanks to the Affordable Care Act subsidies. \u000a"Repeal and replace" will undo the tremendous progress we have made in reducing the number of uninsured by half, both nationally and in California. For the more than 20 Million Americans who gained health insurance coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, repeal and replace means death and despair."\u000aDave Jones, Insurance Commissioner\u000aSource: Dave Jones, Insurance Commissioner

VA Kansas pet owner was horrified to find a ladybug infestation in her dog's mouth.\u000aFrances Jirik noticed something odd about her dog, Bailey, when he refused to eat. The dog also became lethargic and started foaming at the mouth.\u000aHe was just lethargic, real lethargic and the foam was just coming. It was kind of scary, Jirik told KWCH.\u000aJiriks brought her dog to a local vet where doctors discovered 30 to 40 insects stuck on the roof of the dogs mouth.\u000aThe bites can leave an open wound in a dogs mouth, leading to serious consequences, according to veterinarian Dr. Lindsay Mitchell.\u000aDefinitely its painful, said Mitchell. Theyll have some pain, they wont want to eat as well, and they run the chance of infection if they have those ulcers there.\u000aMitchell posted a photo of the infestation on social media, reports Red Book.\u000a"This is the second pup I have seen like this today," Mitchell wrote on Facebook. "If your pet is drooling or foaming at the mouth, look for these ladybugs. They cause ulcers on the tongue and mouth and have a very painful bite."\u000aMitchells photo and warning quickly became viral and caught the attention of many pet owners.\u000aOne Facebook user wrote, Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this. I noticed my son's little dog had not eaten his food from yesterday. I went on to finish chores, then turned around to check his mouth. He had just a little foam around the mouth. When I opened his mouth it was covered worse than this photo."\u000aThe Asian ladybugs are also referred to as harlequin lady beetles and can be credited to a surge in the local aphid population.\u000a"With a lot of aphids, they produced a lot of ladybugs to be able to attack and eat and control the aphids," Barton County Extension Agent Alicia Boor told KWCH.\u000aAccording to Snopes, theres no concrete evidence that Asian lady bugs are harmful to pets and many users identified the bugs in Baileys mouth as common ladybugs.

VBill OReilly held a Sunday night show of The OReilly Factor tonight, and he he used his talking points memo to address FBI director James Comeys decision that there is nothing new to his latest probe on Hillary Clintons email server.\u000aWhile OReilly stated that the shadow of corruption remains a part of Clinton, he believes that most people made up their minds some time ago about whether it would affect who they would vote for on Tuesday. This was the case, OReilly said, even if everyone knows that Clinton is held to a different standard under the law.\u000aAnything short of an indictment is not going to change opinions, OReilly stated. It is quite obvious that the Justice Department under President Obama has little interest in holding Hillary Clinton to account but every person knows that.\u000aOReilly noted that the news would also serve to deflect new WikiLeaks emails and other problematic revelations away from the former secretary of states campaign. OReilly pointed to one example where a hacked email suggests that Chelsea Clinton used Clinton Foundation funds for personal reasons.\u000aWatch above, via Fox.\u000a

V'Clinton is in serious trouble': Internet pirate Kim Dotcom warns 'there's unpublished material yet to come' speculating Wikileaks might soon release her deleted 33,000 emails\u000a\u000aInternet mogul Kim Dotcom has said there are still more Hillary Clinton emails to be published, warning the Democratic presidential nominee is in 'serious trouble.'\u000a\u000aThe Megaupload founder shared the news this week, causing speculation that Wikileaks could be releasing Clinton's 33,000 missing emails, InfoWars reported.\u000a\u000a'There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble,' ?he tweeted on Monday night.\u000a\u000aInternet mogul Kim Dotcom (picture) has said there are still more Hillary Clinton emails to be published, warning the Democratic presidential nominee is in 'serious trouble'\u000a\u000aDotcom has previously hinted that Wikileaks is in possession of the missing emails, which Clinton?acknowledged erasing rather than turning over to the State Department upon her retirement, claiming they were not work-related.\u000a\u000aDotcom last week made a joking reference to the BleachBit software Clinton used to delete the emails, writing 'Bleachbit(ch) can't bleach it.'\u000a\u000aShortly after, he then tweeted directly at Wikileaks writing 'Oh no!' with a video of him reacting to audio saying 'You've got mail.'\u000a\u000aAnd days before on October 27, he wrote that he knew where the deleted emails are and how to get them legally.\u000a\u000aThe German entrepreneur, who has a long-standing relationship with Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, had said last year that Assange would be Clinton's worst nightmare in 2016 because he 'has access to information'\u000a\u000a'I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump. 100% 1. Retweet,' he wrote.\u000a\u000aDotcom, who is wanted in the United States on copyright infringement and money-laundering charges over his file-sharing website Megaupload, then included a step-by-step guide to how to access them.\u000a\u000a'Access all emails Clinton sent or received in the last 7 years,' he wrote.\u000a\u000a'They are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah. Congress or Senate can request the emails from the NSA.'\u000a\u000aClinton's missing emails had long been thought to have been be permanently erased and destroyed beyond recovery.\u000a\u000aHowever, newly released FBI notes suggest the emails still exist in several locations, including a Google server, according to the New York Post.?\u000a\u000aThe German entrepreneur, who has a long-standing relationship with Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, had said last year that Assange would be Clinton's worst nightmare in 2016 because he 'has access to information.'?\u000a\u000aThat came to be 1 as Wikileaks,?an organization that has obtained classified documents and official government memoranda,?has published tens of thousands of emails hacked from Clinton's?campaign chairman John Podesta in recent weeks.?\u000a\u000aOn October 27, Doctom wrote that Clinton's deleted emails are stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah and that he knows how to get them legally\u000a\u000aThe speculation Dotcom has stirred relating to another possible email dump comes amid a high pressure FBI probe of newly discovered Clinton emails.\u000a\u000aFBI agents are currently plumbing the 650,000 emails found on a laptop taken from Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a close Clinton aide, Huma Abedin.\u000a\u000aThousands of them could be from Clinton's private server.?\u000a\u000aFeds had seized the laptop belonging to Weiner in September after DailyMail.com exposed his sexting of a 15-year-old girl.?\u000a\u000aThe FBI, which made a copy of the laptop hard drive, is reportedly targeting only email belonging to Abedin, who apparently had shared the laptop with her husband.\u000a\u000aLike Clinton, Abedin used other email accounts besides her state.gov account, including a Yahoo account and clintonemail.com, Clinton's private server, the according to reports citing sources close to the investigation.\u000a\u000aWhat will come out of the probe and when is not known, but the impact of the FBI's bombshell discovery of the new trove of Clinton emails is already reverberating in the neck-and-neck race for the White House.?\u000a\u000aThe latest poll on Tuesday showed Republican nominee Donald Trump edging ahead of Clinton for the first time since May and with only seven days until the election.\u000a\u000aTrump has seized on the October surprise to put Clinton on the defensive, while Democrats have assailed FBI chief James Comey for breaking with policy and protocol by effectively reopening an investigation into Clinton's handling of state secrets so close to the elections.\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton's aide Justin Cooper sets up clintonemail.com domain.

At one point Cara was going to be sent home from the tour but at the last second, officials reconsidered and exiled him to the blue side of the tour.

VA woman weeps as election results are announced during Hillary Clinton's election night rally in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 8. | AP Photo\u000a\u000aFor women who were prepared for a historic breakthrough C their own version of the explosion of joy at Barack Obamas 2008 victory rally C the election returns that put Donald Trump on the precipice of victory sunk in slowly, turning joy into numbness, and numbness into anger.\u000a\u000aMany of Hillary Clintons women supporters were in tears and streaming out of the Javits Center Tuesday night, expressing shock and horror at Trumps surprise showing.\u000a\u000aI have children with autism. This is devastating to me, said Linda Quintanilha, a civil rights organizer, who was sitting on the empty floor in front of the podium where she had expected to listen to Clinton deliver a rousing victory speech. Im scared of the fight for their dignity. My heart is telling me this is not my America.\u000a\u000aAmong women who gathered by the thousands at the Clinton election night headquarters, and many who watched at home, there was an overwhelming sense of fear for the sexism they felt pouring in from the polls.\u000a\u000aI cant believe this is happening, said Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen, a stalwart Clinton supporter. People hate women.\u000a\u000aMany women in the empty Javits Center concluded that the country was sexist and rejected Clinton in a large part because she was a woman -- and was now headed backwards when it came to womens rights.\u000a\u000aIf Hillary Clinton were a man, tonight would be a much different night, said Dana Nicolette, who manages a wellness center on Marthas Vineyard. Do people not know what autonomy over our own body means? They havent read history books? I have no words. I have no idea. I dont know how as a woman, you could vote for that person who I dont even want to say their name right now.\u000a\u000aEarly exit polls showed Clinton beat Trump by double digits among women voters. And that 43 percent of women said they would be scared if Trump were elected president. But the gender gap, which tightened as the exit pollsters re-weighted their results to match the returns, didnt seem to be enough to put Clinton over the edge. And it was far lower than the 20 percent that some polls had shown in the wake of Trumps taped comments that seemingly endorsed sexual assault.\u000a\u000aI think part of the population was complacent, listening to the polls, saying we dont have to worry, shes going to win, said New York State Senator Roxanne Persaud. It's beyond shocking. What Trump represents is regression.\u000a\u000aAs a gay woman its terrifying," said Rachel Albert, who said she was sticking it out at the Javits until the bitter end. "In some states its still legal to fire people based on their sexuality. Best case scenario, Trump gets impeached and Mike Pence, we know how bad he is based on what hes done in his own state.\u000a\u000aWhile many thought they would wake up to a new world Wednesday morning, those who had witnessed similar phenomenon in Europe after the British "Brexit" vote said their biggest fear was that people would settle back into their daily routines and ignore the significance of Trump's election.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people in here are going to wake up tomorrow and live the same lives and have breakfast, said Danish model Elsa Sylvan, who had tears streaming down her cheeks.

VGood news for this guy.\u000aIts still four days until the election, but some forecasters are already calling the fight for the House of Representatives.\u000aThe race for the House is over: Republicans are going to keep it, says Geoffrey Skelley, who tracks congressional math at the University of Virginias Center for Politics, in an interview. I can give you a probability on that prediction: There is zero chance Democrats win it.\u000aHillary Clinton is clinging to a narrow lead in the presidential race, and Democrats have at least a decent shot of winning back the Senate. But as Skelley, the Washington Post, and the Cook Political Report have all predicted this week, its now all but guaranteed that Republicans will keep the House  and keep Congress gridlocked into 2017.\u000aDonald Trumps recovery has helped saved congressional Republicans \u000aWeve known for a while that Democrats would face long odds in retaking the House this year. They need a 30-seat swing, and no incumbent party has gained that many since 1964. So history was never on their side.\u000aRepublicans have also gerrymandered a fortress of remarkably safe seats, forcing House Democrats to have to outperform Republicans nationally by massive margins to win back the House. (In 2012, House Democratic candidates overall got several million more votes than their Republican rivals. But because of gerrymandering, so many Democratic votes went to safe seats that they still didn't win House control.) Partially as a result, Democrats also have had a heap of difficulty recruiting qualified candidates for important seats.\u000aBut Donald Trumps polling implosion back in August  and then again after the grab em by the pussy comments surfaced  looked like it might be a once-in-a-lifetime political event. When Trump was down by around 10 points in some polls, it was possible, if you squinted a bit, to envision wildly depressed Republican turnout that might allow Democrats to eke out a House victory. \u000aSkelley calculated that if Clinton blew out Trump by 7 points or more, she would win in 50 House districts currently represented by Republicans. Having Clinton win a district never meant that the Democrats House candidate would also win  but it at least suggested the possibility. \u000a"All of our models, and so much of what we know, suggest that the House Republicans should be fine," Barry Burden, a political scientist at Wisconsin, told me back in early October. "But all of the models also presume that parties operate the way parties have operated in the past. And the trouble with Trump is that hes changing everything at once."\u000aBut over the past three weeks, support for Trump has stabilized. Upward of 85 percent of Republican voters now plan to support him. Hes now running even or only a few points behind Clinton. Theres strong enthusiasm for his campaign.\u000aDemocrats needed an essentially unprecedented collapse in GOP turnout to take back the House. And with Trumps resurgence, its clearer than ever that theyre not going to get it.\u000aTrump has recovered in the polls, Skelley says, and hes taken Democrats chance of winning the House with him.\u000aThe Democratic Party is not popular enough\u000aBut Trumps recovery is not the only reason we can be reasonably certain the House is out of the cards for the Democrats. Other key signs show that the Democratic Party simply isnt popular enough to do so.\u000aNow, its normally very difficult to figure out who is set to win the House  unlike the presidential and Senate races, there are very few public polls of individual districts. Instead, experts rely on whats called a generic ballot, which asks voters if theyd prefer a generic Democrat or a generic Republican (with no names attached) to get a sense of which party is more popular in the country overall.\u000aHistorically, this metric has probably been one of our best ways for guessing what will happen in House races across the country. Right now, it shows that Democrats are leading by 3 points.\u000aThat does mean theyre on pace to win millions more votes than Republicans in November, just not enough for the House. Earlier this campaign, Emory political scientist Alan Abramowitz created a model based on the fundamentals  things like the state of the economy and the presidents approval rating  to game out the state of the House race.\u000aHe projected that Democrats would need somewhere in the range of a 14-point victory to pick up 31 House seats: \u000aA win of 3 points puts them in range to pick up 11 seats  about a third of what they really need.\u000aThats not going to cut it. Democrats hoping to take back the House always faced long odds. But if they really want to take seize control of Congress, theyll almost certainly have to look beyond 2016.

He refused to so so and instead took off, with Hancock County deputies giving chase, said Chief Deputy Don Bass.\u000aHe was in a Yukon truck, Bass said.\u000aThen he bailed out with a female still in the truck and headed for the woods, Bass said.\u000aDeputies gave chase and took him into custody, but one of the deputies was hurt during the escapades in the woods, Bass said. Thats why he was charged with simple assault on a police officer.\u000aBass also said the charges of careless driving and reckless driving differ in that careless would be inadvertently swerving into a lane or failing to stop at a stop sign, while reckless driving would be deliberately putting others in harms way by the way you were driving.\u000aMillis also faces a probation violation for his offenses. He was out on charges of possession of a controlled substance, out-of-state simple burglary and property damage and robbery/larceny convictions. He is on hold for the state Department of Corrections.\u000aHis list of offenses:\u000a?  Eluding an law officer by motor vehicle, felony\u000a?  Simple assault on an officer, felony\u000a?

VSet the contents of Hillarys emails aside for a moment. For this story lets look at obstruction of justice.\u000aYou see, federal obstruction of justice in and of itself is a felony that carries a prison sentence of up to 5 years.\u000aWhy is that relevant here? Well, Hillary Clinton and her inner circle told federal investigators all emails were turned over to the FBI. That would be fine and dandy if it were 1.\u000aBut according to CBS it isnt.\u000a.@CBSNews confirms FBI found emails on #AnthonyWeiner computer, related to Hillary Clinton server, that are "new" \u005cu0026 not previously reviewed.\u000a Paula Reid (@PaulaReidCBS) November 3, 2016\u000aCBS news confirms the FBI has emails from Weiners computer that had not been previously reviewed. \u000aIn other words, those emails were never handed over to the FBI. This after Clinton and her team claimed all emails were handed over. \u000aWhat we have brewing here is both a lie and what appears to be blatant obstruction of justice.

VSay what you mean.\u000aAfter Trumps election, Democratic leaders including president Obama and Hillary Clinton have gone out of their way to be gracious about their loss, and to wish Trump well.\u000aNot Harry Reid.\u000aReid, the senate minority leader who is retiring this year, unleashed a broadside at Trump in a statement today (Nov. 11), calling him out for his racism and sexism:\u000aIf this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate. Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try.\u000aIf Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately.\u000aReid also says the fears of women, immigrants and minorities is legitimate, and shouldnt be waved away. Their fear is legitimate and we must refuse to let it fall through the cracks between the fluff pieces, he said.\u000aHere is the full statement:\u000aReid Statement on the Election of Donald Trump\u000aWashington, D.C. C Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement about the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States: \u000aI have personally been on the ballot in Nevada for 26 elections and I have never seen anything like the reaction to the election completed last Tuesday. The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America.\u000aWhite nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trumps victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear C especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.\u000aI have heard more stories in the past 48 hours of Americans living in fear of their own government and their fellow Americans than I can remember hearing in five decades in politics. Hispanic Americans who fear their families will be torn apart, African Americans being heckled on the street, Muslim Americans afraid to wear a headscarf, gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands. American children waking up in the middle of the night crying, terrified that Trump will take their parents away. Young girls unable to understand why a man who brags about sexually assaulting women has been elected president.\u000aI have a large family. I have one daughter and twelve granddaughters. The texts, emails and phone calls I have received from them have been filled with fear C fear for themselves, fear for their Hispanic and African American friends, for their Muslim and Jewish friends, for their LBGT friends, for their Asian friends. Ive felt their tears and Ive felt their fear.\u000aWe as a nation must find a way to move forward without consigning those who Trump has threatened to the shadows. Their fear is entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them. Every news piece that breathlessly obsesses over inauguration preparations compounds their fear by normalizing a man who has threatened to tear families apart, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women and who has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African Americans. Their fear is legitimate and we must refuse to let it fall through the cracks between the fluff pieces.\u000aIf this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate. Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try.\u000aIf Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately.

VNEW ORLEANS (AP)  The Latest on a former New Orleans police officer accused in the cover-up of shootings that killed two people after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (all times local):\u000a12 p.m.\u000aThe brother of a man shot and killed by police after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 says he's thankful the criminal case is over and every officer involved has admitted guilt.\u000aLance Madison's brother Ronald was among six people shot by police on a New Orleans bridge on Sept. 4, 2005, and one of two who were killed.\u000aRetired police sergeant Gerard Dugue (DOO-gay) pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor count of helping in a cover-up. The judge dismissed an indictment charging him with multiple felonies and sentenced him to a year on probation, plus restitution.\u000aDefense attorney Claude Kelly says Dugue can now enjoy his retirement.\u000a___\u000a10 a.m.\u000aA former New Orleans police officer accused in the cover-up of shootings that killed two people after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.\u000aGerard Dugue (DOOH'-gay) pleaded guilty on Friday, a day after prosecutors replaced felony charges with a single misdemeanor charge: "accessory after the fact to willful deprivation of rights under cover of law."\u000aU.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt sentenced Dugue to a year of probation and ordered him to pay restitution, saying he will determine the amount after civil lawsuits filed by victims' families have been resolved.\u000aDugue, a retired sergeant, was accused of helping cover up shootings at New Orleans' Danziger bridge. Five former police officers pleaded guilty earlier this year: four in connection with the shootings; one for a role in the cover-up. Their sentences range from three to 12 years.\u000aAn indictment initially charged Dugue with multiple felonies including conspiracy to obstruct justice. The new charge eliminates the need for a trial, which had been set for Monday.\u000aThe plea resolves a long-running criminal case that roiled the New Orleans Police Department after Katrina.\u000aThe city and the U.S. Justice Department agreed to a reform plan for the police department in 2012.\u000a___\u000a2:45 a.m.\u000aA former New Orleans police officer accused in the cover-up of shootings that killed two people after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 is set to change his plea.\u000aThe hearing Friday for Gerard Dugue (DOOH'-gay) comes a day after federal prosecutors reduced felony charges against him to a single misdemeanor.\u000aHe's accused in the cover-up of police shootings that killed two people at New Orleans' Danziger bridge.

If made possible, a perpetual motion machine could generate infinite energy.\u000aThe Second Law profoundly sets the limits for what is possible in our universe, defining why everything within it must one day decay.\u000aNow, physicists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) have founda small loophole that could allow scientists to bypass the Second Law, potentially giving us access to machines that generate infinite energy.\u000aSome small-scale perpetual motion machines - mostly proofs of concept - have been made and posted to YouTube by amateur engineers and physicists.\u000a Underpinning the Second Law is that entropy - the measurement of quantum chaos driving every particle in our universe - constantly increases. \u000aEinstein once claimed that the Laws of Thermodynamics would 'never be overthrown'\u000aThe ANL researchers claim that their loophole could bypass this long-held rule of the universe, allowing the accelerating march of entropy to go in the opposite direction.\u000aThis would only be on a small, local scale, and for short periods of time.\u000aThe physicists investigated a statistical concept linked to the Second Law, known as the H-theorem. \u000aAt the heart of this rule is the concept of entropy, a measurement of chaos between particles.\u000aEntropy will always even out in a closed system, so particles in a high entropy area (for instance, a hot room) will always flow to a low entropy area (for instance, a cold room) until the entropy of each has evened out. \u000aTypically, scientists assess the effects of the H-theorem by analysing how large groups of molecules move, as analysing a single molecule at a time is incredibly complex.\u000aBut the team at ANL decided to take on the challenge.\u000aBy using a complex set of abstract mathematics, known as quantum information theory, and applying it to condensed matter physics, the team crafted a new, quantum-level H-theorem that could read the path of individual molecules instead of large groups.\u000a WHAT IS THE H-THEORUM?\u000aThe Second Law focuses on inefficiency, degradation and decay within our universe.\u000aIt tells us that almost everything we do is wasteful, and that there are many irreversible processes in the Universe - like boiling an egg, or burning petrol.\u000aThe key concept behind the second law is the H theorem, which lays out that heat will always flow from a hot to a cold room, until both rooms are the same temperature.\u000aAt the heart of this rule is the concept of entropy, a measurement of chaos between particles.\u000aEntropy will always even out in a closed system, so particles in a high entropy area (for instance, a hot room) will always flow to a low entropy area (for instance, a cold room) until the entropy of each has evened out.\u000aUsing this model, scientists have determined that entropy will always increase in our universe as more and more energy is used.\u000aEventually, this will lead to the 'heat death' of our universe in around 10x10(103) years.\u000a'This allowed us to formulate the quantum H-theorem as it related to things that could be physically observed,' said Dr Ivan Sadovskyy, one of the APL team.\u000a'It establishes a connection between well-documented quantum physics processes and the theoretical quantum channels that make up quantum information theory.'\u000aIn this new quantum H-theorem model, some molecules were seen to temporarily decrease in entropy, shattering the Second Rule of Thermodynamics.\u000aThe Argonne Lab team has now taken things a step further by brewing up a mathematical model to show how a quantum system could be created where there is a temporary 'negative entropy gain' - in other words, a decrease in entropy.\u000a'Although the violation is only on the local scale, the implications are far-reaching,' said Dr Valerii Vinokur, another member of the APL team.\u000aDr Vinokur added that the finding eventually 'Could make possible a local quantum perpetual motion machine.'\u000aWhilst these quantum perpetual motion machines are still purely theoretical, the APL team's findings represent the first big step towards a real, working device.

VThis story first appeared on the CarBuzz app\u000aWe miss the Karmann Ghia, and think that it could be a hot seller.\u000a The Karmann Ghia was a Volkswagen model sold from 1955 all the way to 1974. Like the Beetle on which is was based, the Karmann Ghia lived a very long production life. However, unlike the Beetle (which was revived in 1997), the Karmann Ghia was never brought back to life. We think that this was a misstep by Volkswagen. Even though the Scirocco was ultimately seen as a replacement for the Karmann Ghia, we think that a sporty, convertible could fit well in Volkswagen's current lineup.\u000aLike the original, we think that this new model could be based on the Beetle. This is not so bad, because the Beetle is now based on the Golf platform, which is excellent. Basically, this new Karmann Ghia could borrow components from the MK7 Golf GTI, which is a fantastic car. Unfortunately, this would mean that the Karmann Ghia wouldn't be rear engined like the original, but don't worry, we have an alternative plan for that. For now, let's just stick with the GTI-based car. The current Golf GTI comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 210 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. You can also get a 220 hp with the optional performance pack, which comes with a limited-slip differential.\u000aEven though the Beetle Turbo has always shared an engine and transmission with the GTI, it's tuned for comfort rather than aggressiveness. We think that the Karmann Ghia could drive more like a GTI than the Beetle, making it a better option for enthusiasts. Like the original, we would offer a coupe and convertible model, both with 2+2 seating. The coupe model would have a stylish lift-back like the Audi A5 Sportback, while the convertible would have to have a more conventional trunk. While this concept would be a lot easier for Volkswagen to execute, it is not the only idea that we had for a new Karmann Ghia. If Volkswagen was willing to be a little more ambitious with this project, we have an idea that involves Porsche.\u000aThe new Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman shook things up by switching from naturally aspirated flat-six engines to new turbocharged flat-four engines. The base 718 Boxster and Cayman are available with a 2.0-liter flat-four with 300 hp, while the S models come with a larger 2.5-liter engine with 350 hp. In order to make sure that the Karmann Ghia doesn't steal any customers away from Porsche, we would only use the smaller 2.0-liter engine, and detune it to around 260 to 280 hp. By basing the Karmann Ghia on the 718's platform, it would be more like the original with a flat-four engine behind the driver, although this engine wouldn't be air-cooled like the original and it would be mid-engined, not rear-engined.\u000aWe still love this idea, because it would give consumers the option to buy an affordable Porsche without tarnishing the Porsche brand. In the past, Porsche has attempted to cater to a more affordable segment with models like the 914 and 924, only to see these models bring down the brand's prestige. By letting Volkswagen borrow from the 718, Porsche could create a 1 "entry level" car in the form of the Karmann Ghia. We don't think that the Karmann Ghia gets the credit it deserves for being one of the prettiest affordable cars of all time. In 1990, Karmann introduced a Karmann Ghia-inspired concept car called the Karmann Coupe at the Frankfurt Motor Show (pictured below).\u000aWhile the 1990 design study is not our favorite, we do see potential for how pretty a modern Karmann Ghia could look. In April of 2013, Karmann Ghia do Brasil began a competition for Brazilian students to design a modern interpretation of the car. Enthusiasm for the Karmann Ghia's return is there and it would make for a fantastic flagship model for the Volkswagen lineup.\u000aTop Stories Today\u000aMore Stories

VDonald Trump in Nevada. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\u000aIt's fair to say Donald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos aren't on the best terms.\u000aTrump has often attacked Bezos for using his Washington Post ownership to keep taxes low on Amazon and free of antitrust allegations, famously saying, "if I become president, oh, do they have problems."\u000aBezos, meanwhile, called out Trump for his accusations of mainstream media bias, saying he's "eroding our democracy," and suggesting Trump take a trip to space instead.\u000aNow that Trump will become the next US president, Bezos and the companies he own  Amazon and The Washington Post specifically  may have to brace themselves. These are the areas that could face increased scrutiny under Trump's presidency:\u000aTaxes\u000aTrump seems to believe Bezos's ownership in The Washington Post (a company owned by Bezos himself, not Amazon) is somehow helping Amazon keep its taxes low.\u000aHe once called Amazon a "big tax shelter" and suggested Bezos is using The Post's unprofitable business as a means for tax deduction on Amazon. He also said Amazon is getting away with "murder" because Bezos is using Washington Post's influence to keep politicians away from taxing the company properly.\u000aIt's unclear what actions Trump will take to prove his case, but it's not hard to see him threatening to put more pressure on Bezos and Amazon by asking the IRS to increase its scrutiny.\u000a"[Bezos] bought this paper for practically nothing, and hes using that as a tool for political power, against me and against other people, and Ill tell you what, we cant let him get away with it," Trump said in an interview with Fox News in May.\u000aAmazon paid $273 million in income taxes in 2015. The company has historically had very little profit and only about $14 billion in cash, a small amount compared to other companies of its size.\u000aOn the other hand, if anything, Trump's proposed tax policy could help Amazon. Trump plans to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and cut the tax rate on income held overseas to 10% from the current 35%.\u000aAntitrust\u000aTrump once claimed Bezos has a "huge antitrust problem."\u000a"What hes got is a monopoly, and he wants to make sure I dont get in," Trump said.\u000aIt's 1 that Amazon controls a big chunk of the online retail and cloud computing market, but making a case for antitrust could prove difficult for Trump.\u000aAntitrust laws clearly state that the main goal is to protect consumers from unfair price hikes due to the lack of competition. But Amazon is all about offering every day low prices and putting customers first in its business. Amazon also owns just 15% share of total US retail and 20% share in e-commerce  hardly anywhere near a monopoly.\u000aThere's a chance Amazon could potentially raise prices in the future, but its history suggests that's unlikely. Amazon continuously offers discounts and big sales days, while its cloud service AWS is the driving force behind an industry-wide price war, even after offering 52 price cuts so far.\u000aThe Washington Post\u000aPerhaps Trump's biggest concern seems to be Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. He believes Bezos exerted influence over the paper's editorial voice in order to reduce Trump's chances of winning the presidency. In the run-up to the election, The Post did break a number of stories that tainted Trump's image.\u000aBezos has repeatedly disputed this claim and made it clear that he is not involved in the editorial process. He's also criticized Trump for not welcoming more media scrutiny.\u000aAn appropriate thing for a presidential candidate to do is say, I am running for the highest office in the world, please scrutinize me.' Thats not what weve seen. To try and chill the media and threaten retribution and retaliation, which is what hes done in a number of cases, it just isnt appropriate," Bezos said.\u000aWe don't know what Trump will do to The Washington Post, but the paper has a long history as a political watch dog, so this is an area to watch.\u000aInvestors\u000aAmazon's stock is down 2.6% as of Wednesday afternoon, but most investors believe Amazon won't be much affected by Trump, largely because it's still growing fast with a lot of long-term growth potential in front of it.\u000aScreenshot / CNBC\u000a"The drivers of Amazons business are broad  secular growth trends in online retail, cloud computing, and media distribution  that it wouldnt seem to me to be at risk unless the government specifically began to regulate those industries with impediments to growth, which seems unlikely," Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider.\u000aMizuho's analyst Neil Doshi also noted he remains bullish on Amazon because its market share is "far from displaying monopolistic characteristics" and growth remains strong.\u000a"We remain buyers of Amazon's stock given its growing market share of retail dollars shifting online, strong flywheels around its core business, and continued strength and profitability coming from its AWS cloud segment," Doshi wrote.\u000aAmazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment on this article.\u000aDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

VIf you're the kind of person who thinks lap dances are a little creepy, or if you're the kind of person who thinks Maci Bookout is a beacon of light and hope and goodness on Teen Mom OG ... well, sorry.\u000a Back in September, Maci and her friends went on a girl's trip to Las Vegas -- a sort of weekend-long bachelorette party -- and now we're learning that things got weird.\u000a And they got weird fast:\u000aMaci Bookout Gets A Creepy Lap Dance\u000a In this sneak peek from next week's new episode of Teen Mom OG, you can see Maci's pals surprise her with a trip to Australia's Thunder from Down Under.\u000a It's a strip club, y'all!\u000a As they pull her in, Maci keeps putting her hands over her mouth and acting like she's totally shocked and scandalized, which is fair.\u000a After all, she's taking part in the time-honored tradition of "you're about to get married, so ogle strange men's penises before you say 'I do'!", how else would she react?\u000a But it doesn't take long before things go beyond just ogling, because a guy takes Maci by the hand and pulls her onstage.\u000a He sits her down in one of two chairs that are surrounded by fog machines, and then he proceeds to get the show on the road.\u000a The sad, questionable, uncomfortable, cringe-worthy show.\u000a Maci tries putting her hands over her mouth again, but the stripper is not having it -- he puts them around his waist instead, and our girl quickly moves to grab his ass.\u000a So much for being scandalized, huh?\u000a And hey, real quick, be sure to put on your best pearls so you can clutch the hell out of them, because next, Maci actually runs her hand over this dude's body.\u000a But like, all over it.\u000a She touches his chest, his abs, and she doesn't stop when she gets to the Danger Zone, no -- she straight up rubs this stripper's crotch.\u000a And then he kisses her on the mouth.\u000a Aren't there rules about this kind of thing at strip clubs?\u000a And, if not, aren't their boundaries you set up when you're in a committed relationship?\u000a The answer seems to be a big fat "no" to both of those questions, or at least that's what we gathered when Maci let a stripper pull her to the floor and dry hump her.\u000a Come get your girl, Taylor McKinney, or else this stripper will.\u000a Really, Taylor would be justified in being upset over this sketchy lap dance, but we're guessing that, since they got married anyway, he wasn't.\u000a Or maybe he wasn't told about the dance, and he's just now seeing it, along with the rest of us.\u000a Either way, what a surprising little bit of Teen Mom nonsense we have here.

VRonda Rousey and Amanda Nunes face-off in New York ahead of their bantamweight title fight in December\u000aRonda Rousey made a surprise appearance at the ceremonial UFC 205 weigh in on Friday to promote her bantamweight title fight with Amanda Nunes in UFC 207 on 30 December in Las Vegas. The former Ultimate Fighting Championship bantamweight title holder will appear on stage after Saturday (12 November) events main card Eddie Alvarez and Conor McGregorhas finished their routine weigh in ahead of the fight.\u000aRousey is making a return to the octagon for the first time in over a year after she suffered a brutal knockout against Holly Holm when she lost her bantamweight title. The crowd had just witnessed the weigh in between McGregor and Alvarez, who are fighting for the light weight title at the Madison Square Garden after which the former champion arrived on stage for her stare down against Nunes, but she immediately stormed off stage not staying to answer any questions.\u000aJoe Rogan managed to get Nunes, but not Rousey for an interview immediately after the stare down and the former made it clear that she trained throughout her career to fight the longest reigning women's bantamweight champion in UFC history.\u000a"She's the fight I asked for. I've been training for this girl my whole career in the UFC, and now I have the chance to defend my belt against her. It's going to be amazing. Are you guys ready for this battle?" Nunes told Rogan following her confrontation with Rousey, as quoted by MMAJunkie.com\u000aMeanwhile, Miesha Tate, who lost her title to Amanda Nunes earlier in the year has backed the Brazilian fighter to retain her title and made a request for a rematch if she wins her UFC 205 bout against Raquel Pennington at Madison Square Garden on Saturday (12 November).\u000a"I wouldn't be surprised if Amanda wins. Amanda's a very tough girl, has the skill set to beat anybody, and we have to wonder where Ronda is mentally after such a long layoff," Tate said, as quoted by the Los Angeles Times.\u000a"The last fight  getting caught early  I believe a second fight between Amanda and I would go differently," the former bantamweight champion added with regards to a possible rematch with Nunes.

VWhats the deal with vitamin B12?\u000aiStock/NatchaS\u000aThere are eight B vitamins, and all of them give your body energy by helping to convert food into fuel. Vitamin B12 is especially important in producing DNA and maintaining healthy nerve and blood cells. One way it protects blood cells is by preventing megaloblastic anemia, a condition that reduces the amount of oxygen your red blood cells can carry. The recommended daily amount of B12 is 2.4 mcg, and most people consume that much naturally by eating healthy amounts of protein. A deficiency occurs when vitamin B12 isnt a regular part of someones diet or when someone cant absorb the nutrient properly.\u000aYour hands or feet feel numb and tingling\u000aiStock/Susan Chiang\u000aVitamin B12 helps make myelin, the protective covering for nerves. Without it, your nerves could get damaged since they arent being properly formed. When nerves start shrinking, you start going from normal sensations to pins and needles, says Sonya Angelone, MS, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Numbness is also a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other conditions, so be sure to see a doctor to get checked out.\u000aiStock/Poike\u000aFeeling overly tired, weak, or short of breath? Your blood cells could be the culprit. Since vitamin B12 plays an important role with blood cells, a deficiency often results in megaloblastic anemia. The body starts producing large, immature red blood cells that cant carry oxygen throughout the body. That lack of oxygen makes you feel run down. Here are other medical reasons you might be tired all the time.\u000aYour skin is pale or yellowish\u000aiStock/brown54486\u000aWhen your skin starts losing its healthy glow, your chances of having a vitamin deficiency grow. If youre anemic, youre getting less efficient large cells that arent doing the job of carrying oxygen and oxygenating the blood, so that can lead to paleness, Angelone says. Indian researchers also found that jaundice can be a symptom of a severe lack of vitamin B12. Jaundice is also a symptom of liver cancer and certain other cancers, so it's smart to see your doctor to investigate the cause.\u000a Youre vegan or vegetarian\u000aiStock/nata_vkusidey\u000aSorry veggie lovers: Plants dont contain B12. The vitamin is only found in meat, eggs, poultry, and products that come directly from animals. That means vegetarians and especially vegans are at high risk for a vitamin B12 deficiency. However, you can still take supplements and even some fortified grainscertain breakfast cereals and nutritional yeaststo get this necessary nutrient. Angelone cautions to check food labels before buying these products. Some organic versions dont include B12. Here's what happens to your body when you start eating vegan.\u000aYou have diabetes\u000aiStock/vgajic\u000aAlthough not everyone who has diabetes will also have a vitamin B12 problem, researchers are becoming increasingly more aware of a risk for those who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A study from England found that out of 283 type 2 diabetics on high-dose metformin, 33 percent had a vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, Indian researchers tested 90 type 1 diabetics and found that 45 percent had low levels of the nutrient. Check out these other easy-to-miss symptoms of diabetes.\u000aYou take medicine for heartburn\u000aiStock/nebari\u000aPrescription meds to reduce stomach acid bring much needed relief to people with frequent heartburn. But that relief comes at a price. Vitamin B12 needs stomach acid to detach it from its original protein so it can be absorbed into your system. Otherwise, it just continues down your digestive track, and youre left with none of the benefits. All these acid blocker medications that people take? Those decrease B12 absorption, Angelone says. It decreases nutrient absorption and then you get all these secondary problems because of that. Consider these natural remedies for heartburn relief.\u000aiStock/Marjan_Apostolovic\u000aSerotonin is a neurotransmitter that keeps your brain and mood functioning correctly, and researchers believe a deficit in this chemical can lead to depression. Vitamin B12 improves neurotransmitter production and communication between nerves, so a shortage in B12 could also mean a shortage in serotonin. If somebody is depressed, that may be that they dont have enough available serotonin, but it may be that theyre not making enough because they dont have the building blocks to make it. And B12 is one of the building blocks, Angelone says. Here are other warning signs of depression not to miss.\u000aYoure becoming forgetful\u000aiStock/demaerre\u000aSince vitamin B12 works closely with metabolic processes in the brain, a deficiency can lead to memory loss and even dementia symptoms, especially in the elderly. Rush University Medical Center studied 121 people age 65 years or older who had signs of a B12 deficiency. Researchers followed up four and a half years later and found that participants who exhibited four out of five signs of a B12 deficiency were at a higher risk for getting low cognitive test scores and smaller total brain volumes. If your cognitive decline is related to diet and B12 deficiency, then thats easily correctable, Angelone assures.\u000aYoure over age 50\u000aiStock/gpointstudio\u000aIts normal for the body to produce less stomach acid as we age. But since that acid is needed to absorb B12, people over 50 may not be getting the right amount of this vitamin. One of the reasons theyre B12 deficient is that they dont have enough stomach acid, and they just arent able to break off that B12 and absorb it, Angelone says. Talk to your doctor about possible supplement or dietary options.\u000aWhat to do if you have a vitamin B12 deficiency\u000aiStock/Sturti\u000aSupplementing B12 affects how other B vitamins work, so its important to know whats causing the deficiency instead of guessing and trying to treat it on your own. Most people dont get into physiology (when they) take supplements. They just take things because their friend takes it or they heard something about it, says Angelone. Its important to understand what you take and why you take it. The best way to do that? Talk to your doctor.

VThe remains of Erica Parsons were found after her adoptive father claimed to know where they were left. (RCSD)\u000aA North Carolina man allegedly admitted to police that he tortured his disabled, adopted daughter before leading them to the body of the dead 13-year-old girl, who was buried six days before Christmas in 2011, authorities said.\u000aThe remains of Erica Parsons were found in South Carolina in September after her adoptive father, Sandy Parsons, claimed to know where they were left, according to a search warrant obtained by InsideEdition.com that was used to locate the little girls grave.\u000aParsons, 42, was about 12 months into an eight-year prison sentence after he and his wife, Casey Parsons, were convicted of tax fraud  including cashing adoption assistance checks that totaled more than $120,000 long after Erica vanished  when he allegedly reached out to Rowan County sheriffs detective Lt. Chad Moose about his adopted daughter.\u000aLittle Erica was reported missing in July 2013 by James Parsons, her adoptive older brother, after he had an argument with his parents.\u000aHe told police that he had last seen his developmentally disabled younger sister in late 2011.\u000aStanding in the corner as a punishment for unknown reasons, as she was often made to do, Erica looked like a zombie, James Parsons testified at his parents sentencing hearing. \u000aShe said she could not breathe too good, James Parsons said.\u000aHe said his mother told Erica to "shut the f*** up."\u000aHe never saw the girl again.\u000aSandy and Casey Parsons told authorities that Erica had gone to live with her maternal grandmother, a woman named Nan Goodman, who they met through Facebook. Investigators could find no such woman and were able to confirm that Ericas real maternal grandmother had died years earlier.\u000aA nationwide search was launched in hopes of finding Erica, as her image was plastered on billboards and commercials while investigators scoured databases for any trace of the girl.\u000aIn their searches for the child, authorities armed with search warrants at the Parsons home uncovered a closet that Erica was often kept in for long stretches of time; her blood and DNA  from either saliva or urine  was found on the floor, according to reports.\u000aIn August, Parsons went on to tell Moose about the unbearable treatment Erica endured, including being locked in a closet, beaten with a belt buckle, having her fingers bent back and being choked, the warrant said. \u000aUNC School of Medicine Dr. Cynthia Brown characterized the treatment of Erica as child torture, the warrant said.\u000aParsons allegedly said Erica was dead, noting that her body was discarded on December 19, 2011 off Taylor Chapel Road near Pageland, close to his mothers home, police said.\u000aAfter being temporary released from prison, Parsons allegedly led investigators to the makeshift grave, where Ericas skeleton was unearthed after nearly 10 hours.\u000aNo plea deal has been struck, nor were any promises made to Parsons in exchange for the information he provided, officials said. No one has yet been charged in Ericas death, as the North Carolina State Medical Examiner has not yet determined the cause of death.

VA strange phenomenon occurred in California as dome shaped clouds appear over clear blue skies in full view of residents. Conspiracy theorists have suggested that the clouds are the result of a UFO trying to hide itself from view.\u000aThe cloud also appears to have layers, all symmetrical with only slight variations on size. According to them, this was due to the craft moving vertically while at the same time releasing clouds in a disk formation.\u000aAccording to UFO Sightings Daily, the UFO could be much smaller than the clouds itself, no more than a tenth of its size. Editor Scott C. Waring claims that while some extraterrestrials prefer to use existing clouds as cover, their crafts can create their own if there are none in their immediate vicinity.\u000aWhile it seems farfetched that extraterrestrials will go to such extremes to hide their crafts, there are some very logical reasons for them opting to use artificial clouds as cover. Firstly a cloud is a much more natural than using some sort of cloaking that adjusts to ambient light.\u000aUFO Using Clouds To Hide?\u000aInvisibility might be achieved but there will always be a danger of revealing itself such as a malfunction which might disable its cloaking device. Hiding inside a mass of clouds is a much safer as it can freely move about without arousing much suspicion.\u000aSecondly, if by any chance the craft is detected by radar, analysts can simply dismiss it as just another cloud in the sky. Radar has been known to detect large masses of clouds although this was only in a small number of cases.\u000aHowever in this particular case, it was neither radar nor a malfunction that aroused suspicions that the cloud was hiding something. What caught the eye of UFO enthusiasts is the clouds shape which, to witnesses, seemed unnatural.\u000aDo you believe that the California cloud formation was hiding an alien spacecraft? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\u000aWatch the video here:

VAnyone who is thinking about immigrating to the United States may be hitting the pause button on their plans because US immigration policies are probably going to change. President-Elect Donald Trump is well-known for his comments about building a wall along the Mexican border. Countless internet memes have played off his comments, with many YouTube videos poking fun of his building a wall statement triggering the sounds of children laughing about it without understanding what it means.\u000aWhat did Trump really mean?\u000aSo what will happen to US immigration policies after Trump moves into the White House in January? The fears could be overblown because it seems unlikely that he would be able to get his wall built, but it makes sense for immigrants currently in the process of getting their papers to be concerned. Whether or not he gets the wall built, it should be clear to almost everyone that some changes are needed, although this doesnt mean building a wall along the Mexican border.\u000aMost people have heard horror stories about how someone was trying to immigrate to the US but red tape held up their paperwork. The problem is that the red tape has gotten so bad that its become quite common for people to enter the country illegally. Most Americans I know dont have problems with illegal immigrants per se. Its the fact that so many live here but dont pay taxes, which cause taxpayers to pay more in taxes to support their non-taxpaying lifestyle because they are in the country illegally.\u000aWill Trump fix the red tape?\u000aIf theres anyone who should know how bad the red tape is for immigrants, its Donald Trump. One thing no one has made a big issue of, including Trump and his campaign, is that his wife Melania is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Slovenia. They were married in 2005, and she became a U.S. citizen in 2006. Interestingly, Hillary Clinton attended their wedding reception with husband Bill Clinton.\u000aTrump certainly had the financial means to help his wife become a citizen, but not everyone has the finances to pay for expensive lawyers to ease the process along. Nonetheless, for all the controversy around his view on US immigration policies, hopefully this is an area Trump will be interested in changing, if only because his wife was impacted by it. The problem is vetting immigrants without making it impossible for those who want to come and contribute to American society by attending school, working, and paying taxes to get their legal immigration papers.\u000aCertainly Trump has not shown disdain for immigrants from all countries. The Hindustan Times states that Trump expressed support for the Indian and Hindu people, saying that they will have a big friend in the White House if he got elected.\u000aWe want people to come into our country legally, legally, Trump was quoted as saying during a campaign stop in Arizona.\u000aSome immigrants oppose Trump, others support him\u000aHe has, however, said he would remove millions of illegal immigrants from the country. As a result, the hashtag #HereToStay began trending quickly after he claimed victory in the race for the White House. Illegal immigrants began tweeting their support for other undocumented immigrants, pledging support and vowing to stay in the country despite any changes he might make to US immigration policies.\u000aNot all immigrants are against Trump, as recent polls indicate that many actually supported the president-elect in his campaign run. A Pulse Opinion Research survey found this week that 51% of voters agree that there isnt enough enforcement of US immigration laws, and 49% of Latino voters said they support policies that enforce the deportation of illegal immigrants to their home countries. Also some Latino voters even voted for Trump, reports The Los Angeles Times.\u000aWithout taking ethnicity into account, 54% of voters believe the government doesnt do enough to enforce immigration laws, and 56% of Americans support deporting illegal immigrants to their home countries.\u000aA summary of Trumps comments on US immigration policy\u000aSo aside from promising to build a wall along the Mexican border, Trump also made several other outlandish comments regarding his US immigration views, such as forcing the Mexican government to pay to build the wall. Needless to say, that appears doubtful. If he wants to build a wall to replace the fence thats already there, hes going to have to get the funds for it in the federal budget.\u000aHe also promised to send criminal aliens home, something those who support deportation probably want to see. He accused Mexican immigrants of bringing drugs and crime and being rapists, although he had no numbers to state how many of them fall into this category.\u000aIn the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre, he denounced the US immigration system as dysfunction, adding that it does not permit us to know who we let into our country. This comment would suggest that hes going to work on vetting immigrants, although we have no way of knowing how he intends to do this. However, if he could manage something, it should make both sides happy because people who mean no harm and will contribute to society will be able to get in with no problems, while those who dont are kept out.\u000aTrump also promised to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, including Syria and Libya.\u000aHe also stated in March that he would end the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. This claim is actually far more specific than most of the other things he has said about immigration, and it may be why so many immigrants in the country are concerned. However, his Republican colleagues might prevent this.\u000aHow much can Trump really do?\u000aTrump may be limited in what he can actually do in terms of changing US immigration laws because many Republicans actually oppose his position. That is the beauty of a checks and balances system because it means one man cant do anything he wishes. He must convince others to go along with himsomething Trump has failed to do in the area of immigration, according to Pew Research polls conducted at different times throughout the year.\u000aRatings from Cook Political Report indicate that most of the Republicans who were running in the closest 40 House races were open to setting a path for undocumented immigrants to become legal immigrants. Also ten of the 11 Republican Senate candidates were campaigning on platforms of open US immigration policies, meaning that Trump could find his hands tied on this issue. Bills such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects immigrants brought into the country illegally, appear popular, perhaps because they allow these children to stay and work and, potentially, pay taxes like citizens.

V(Credit: Getty/alacatr)\u000aOn Election Day, my home state of California voted to legalize recreational cannabis, as did Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada. So the 2016 elections represented a substantial victory for the legalization movement, which has managed to pass referendums in seven states. With 57 percent of the country now supporting marijuana legalization, according to Pew, it seems likely there will be a nationwide victory sometime in the next few years. However, the War on Drugs is far from over.\u000aEven if marijuana is legalized throughout the United States, there will still be numerous drugs in this country that remain very much illegal, and Americans will suffer because of this. Drugs like psilocybin mushrooms, LSD and MDMA have all demonstrated great potential when it comes to medical benefits, and shown little potential for harm. Still, the idea of legalizing those drugs any time soon seems as likely as Donald Trump hosting a quincea?era.\u000aLSD, psilocybin and MDMA, when combined with psychotherapy, have tremendous medical potential for treating psychiatric illnesses in people for whom other treatments have failed, Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), told me in an email. These psychedelic drugs need to be legalized, both through scientific drug development studies designed to obtain FDA approval for prescription use and through political means so that they are legalized for non-medical purposes like personal growth, spirituality, couples therapy, creativity, innovation, and celebratory experiences.\u000aResearchers in Switzerland found in 2014 that LSD can be helpful for patients dealing with end-of-life anxiety related to a terminal illness. The same sort of conclusion has been drawn for psilocybin. Psilocybin has also proven useful for treating severe depression. MDMA has shown great promise for treating PTSD, when used alongside psychotherapy. All of the drugs remain illegal in the United States, and there has been little effort to change that.\u000aLets not stop there, though. The War on Drugs has cost America well over $1 trillion since it began under Richard Nixon. This war has been the main cause of our countrys mass incarceration problem. As it is often noted, we have 5 percent of the worlds population and roughly 25 percent of its prisoners. You cannot have a War on Drugs, you can only have a war on people. As Gore Vidal famously used to say of the War on Terror, you cannot have a war on a noun, as that is like saying youre at war with dandruff. Too many cant get jobs because of criminal records or lose decades of their lives over small offenses.\u000aWe must legalize all drugs. You cannot regulate a drug that is not legal, and you cannot stop addiction by throwing citizens in cages and putting in no effort to rehabilitate them. I am not arguing for the selling of meth and heroin at your local Target store, but I am arguing for a scenario where you are not put in cuffs for having one of those drugs in your pocket.\u000aPortugal decriminalized all drugs nearly decades ago, and the country has not spiraled into hellfire and cannibalism. In fact, drug use decreased, drug-related deaths went down and the instances of HIV infections decreased severely. Of course, the country also initiated harm-reduction programs and invested in reducing addiction, but it appears decriminalizing the drugs didnt turn every corner into a wanton cocaine party. Perhaps we could learn from this example.\u000aThanks to abuse of prescription painkillers, this country faces a widespread opioid crisis  and all those drugs are legal. While we divvied out legal pills that people didnt really need to fill the pockets of greedheads, as Hunter S. Thompson called them, we locked up people using a different version of the same drugs. Many who got addicted to painkillers while on prescription turned to heroin when they couldnt be prescribed them any more or couldnt afford them. The whole system is toxic.\u000aIm calling for a 1 legalization movement. No longer should lives be ruined because of some minor drug experimentation or because a citizen who needed to make an extra buck sold some substances to a willing buyer. The legalization of marijuana will be a milestone, especially since its the most popular drug out there, but we cannot stop there. We should murder the War on Drugs and burn its cadaver. This war has been one of the biggest policy failures in American history, and weve known this for quite some time. Lets grow up and move forward. We cannot call ourselves the land of the free when we represent the land of the detained.

VBrown and a handful of colleagues have now pretty well scanned the zone around Pluto, out to around 5 billion miles from the sun, for large objects. A frozen ball known as V774104, currently the most distant solar system object known, is twice that far. Go just a little deeper, though, and all kinds of things could be circling about, invisible to even the best telescopes.  \u000aFor now, the evidence for Planet 9 comes solely from its gravity, not from its light. Starting about a decade ago, astronomers noticed odd patterns in the distant solar system. Brown and Batygin were especially struck by the orbits of six of the most extreme objects in the Kuiper Belt (the population of outer objects that includes both Pluto and Eris), all of which cluster on one side of the sky. \u000aThey deduced that a large planet, roughly 10 times the mass of Earth, was lurking on the other side of the sun, its gravitational pull sweeping any smaller stuff out of the way. The pattern of clustering indicated a likely orbit for Planet 9. The fact that nobody had noticed it yet offered another clue: The planet must be on the darkest, farthest part of its looping path, possibly 100 billion miles away. \u000aThat still leaves a lot of sky to examine. To visually track down his putative Planet 9, Brown is requesting 20 nights of observing time on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, the only large instrument with a wide enough field of view to practically pull off such a search. Even if he gets his observing time (theres a lot of competition), the project will take at least a year and a half.

VChange your grip to build more muscle. Changes in grip can stimulate more muscle activity, leading to strength boosts and new muscle growth.\u000aUse an offset grip when doing curls and rear-delt flyes. Hold the dumbbell handle close to the thumb side for curls and close to the pinky side for rear-delt flyes.\u000aFor pulldowns, a wide grip doesn't necessary build wide lats. All grip widths will hit the lats. A medium-width grip targets the biceps a little more.\u000aA close-grip bench press hits the triceps better. However, it also reduces pec involvement. A reverse-grip bench press targets the biceps more.\u000aDitch the close-grip V-handle on seated rows. Use a bar that positions the hands about shoulder-width apart for greater range of motion.\u000aUse a wider hand spacing on upright rows. Elevate the bar to just under 90 degrees to make it safer.\u000aThe right grip stimulates the most muscle activity. Here are the best grips to use on six popular exercises.\u000a1 C Do Offset Dumbbell Biceps Curls\u000aInstead of gripping the dumbbell from the middle in the traditional manner, grip it all the way over on the thumb side.\u000aHere's Why: The biceps are not only elbow flexors, but they're also wrist and forearm supinators. So if we want to achieve maximal biceps recruitment when doing dumbbell curls, we must involve both elbow flexion and forearm supination. You can do this by holding the handle all the way over on the thumb side. This small change makes a huge difference because this grip forces you to resist forearm pronation because the biceps are forced to act as supinators while also serving as elbow flexors.\u000a2 C Use a Medium or Wide Grip on Pulldowns\u000aDespite common belief, all grip widths on the pulldown bar will hit your lats, but you can use a medium-width grip to target the biceps more. So just find a width that feels most comfortable to you.\u000aHere's Why: It's generally believed that a wider grip on the pulldown bar activates the lats more than a narrow one. This belief originates in bodybuilding dogma, but it also appears to be evidence-based. One study found that the wide-grip pulldown produced greater muscle activity than pulldowns using a closer, underhand grip. The problem is that this study didn't compare different overhand grip widths.\u000aLuckily, another study compared a 6RM load and EMG activity using three different pronated grip widths. Lifters performed 6RM in the lat pulldown with narrow, medium, and wide grips C 1, 1.5, and 2 times the biacromial distance, a measure of shoulder width. This study found that, aside from a bit more biceps involvement in the medium-grip width, all three grips produced similar lat activation. This challenges the notion that wide grip is "best" for targeting the lats when doing pulldowns.\u000aIf your objective is to add in some extra biceps work while doing lat pulldowns, a medium-grip width is just what the muscle doctor ordered. You can mix up grip widths to add subtle variety to your lat pulldowns without feeling as if you're missing out on the "special" lat building benefit of using a wide grip.\u000a3 C Use a Neutral, Offset Grip on the Rear-Delt Fly\u000aUse a neutral grip, not a thumbs-down grip, on rear-delt flyes. Hold the dumbbell using an offset grip, all the way to the pinky side.\u000aHere's Why: Using a neutral grip when doing rear-delt flyes will deliver increased activity of the posterior delts compared to using a thumbs-down grip. This also makes sense from an anatomy perspective because the neutral hand position is more externally rotated than the pronated position, as both the posterior deltoid and infraspinatus muscles are also external rotators of the shoulder. Gripping the dumbbell all the way to the pinky finger side forces you to resist shoulder internal rotation (by using more of your posterior delts as external rotators) while performing the rear-delt fly.\u000a4 C Use the Right Grip When Bench Pressing\u000aUse a narrow grip on the bar to hit the triceps better. If you're interested in finding new ways to work the biceps, both wide grip and reverse grip bench presses are great options.\u000aHere's Why: A 2005 study looked at the influence of grip width (narrow, mid, and wide) and forearm pronation/supination on upper-body muscle activity during the flat bench press. A reverse grip resulted in increased activity for the biceps brachii and the clavicular head of the pectoralis major compared to a standard grip. Also, there was no difference in the activity of the sternocostal head of the pectoralis major between a standard and a reverse grip.\u000aA narrower (overhand) grip increased triceps activity and decreased the activity of the sternocostal head of the pectoralis major over other grip options. A wide (overhand) grip produced more biceps brachii activity than standard and reverse grip widths. The reverse-grip bench press is especially effective as it increases the involvement of the biceps brachii without reducing activity to other muscle groups.\u000aAccording to the researchers, "Considering the small changes that occur during changes in grip width, the choice of grip position should be determined by the positions athletes adopt during their sport. Sport specificity should supersede attempts to train specific muscle groups." So it's all about the principle of specificity, which tells us that the adaptations to training will be specific to the demands the training puts on the body.\u000a5 C Do Shoulder-Width Seated Rows\u000aUse a shoulder-width grip on a bar instead of using the narrow, V-shaped handle.\u000aHere's Why: The choice of grip handle you use when performing the seated row can significantly affect your ability to maximize the range of motion, and that in turn affects muscle recruitment.\u000aWhen you use the close-grip handles, the position your hands are stuck in forces you to cut off the final 2 to 3 inches of the range of motion. You don't get complete muscle contraction. Using a handle attachment that positions the hands at about shoulder-width apart will allow for a greater range of motion and more bang for your buck.\u000aThis isn't to say that using the close-grip handle is a waste of time or that no one should do them. It's simply to help you understand that each exercise has its benefits and limitations. And one of the limitations of using the close-grip handle when doing seated rows is that you're unable to reach the level of contraction that you can get when using a handle that positions your arms farther apart.\u000aIf you like close-grip rows for whatever reason, keep doing them. The type of handles you use for neutral-grip seated rows isn't a "do it this way or you're wasting your time" type of thing. You can mix up using the close-grip handle with the shoulder-width handle.\u000a6 C Use a Wide Grip on Upright Rows\u000aUse a wider grip and avoid pulling the elbows above shoulder height.\u000aHere's Why: A wider grip has been shown in studies to increase deltoid and trapezius activity, and correspondingly, less biceps brachii activity. In addition to maximizing recruitment of the muscle we're trying to develop, we need to also consider exercise safety. Avoid pulling the elbows above shoulder height.\u000aStudies indicate that impingement typically peaks between 70 and 120 of glenohumeral elevation. Authors of a 2011 paper recommend that asymptomatic individuals elevate their arms during the upright row to just below 90 (shoulder height). Other authors have made similar recommendations, so at least in this case, turn a deaf ear to the full-ROM gods.\u000aReferences\u000aSignorile JF, Zink AJ, Szwed SP.

VThe Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed a serious FBI complaint against Republican Jon Husted, the Ohio Secretary of State is the top statewide elected official in charge of elections.\u000aThey allege Husted is violating the federal Voting Rights Act by failing to distribute nearly 1 million out of 7 million absentee ballots. \u000aAnecdotal evidence shows that even long time voters are not getting Ohio mail away ballots.\u000aHusteds absentee ballot fiasco in Ohio is impacting literally one out of every seven absentee ballot voters in the state which is indiscriminately disenfranchising voters, leading to this Democratic Coalition complaint to the FBI's Public Corruption program:\u000a Ohio's Secretary of State, Jon Husted, left over a million registered voters off of the mailing list when his office sent out absentee ballots this year. This disadvantages poor, minority, and working class voters who rely on receiving an absentee ballot to cast their votes, and as such violates the Voting Rights Act. On Tuesday it was reported that hundreds of voters had still not received an absentee ballot in the mail, a problem that Husted blamed on the post office. One article even reported that a husband had not received his absentee ballot, while his wife did, even though they had the same voting history. \u000aThe Republican party and its presidential nominee have spent most of the election complaining about rigged results, but the GOP controls over 30 state houses, Ohio amongst them.\u000aFor his part, Jon Husted blames the US Postal Service entirely:\u000a "It's completely unacceptable. The post office needs to do a better job." \u000aBlaming the post office for absentee ballots not being sent is like saying my dog ate my homework. Nobody believes that, after Husted limited millions of voters from receiving absentee ballots the post office is to blame, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition, This entire situation is an obvious partisan attack meant to disadvantage minority, poor, and working-class voters who already have a difficult time making it to the polls.\u000aAccording to local news reports, 13 percent, or over one million, registered voters did not receive absentee ballots in the mail, which was a decision was made by Husted and his office. \u000aSwing state voters already had to fight to stay registered to vote, long before polls opened in Ohio. Hundreds of thousands of people were illegally purged from the voting rolls by Secretary of State John Husted, who lost a federal court case for illegally unregistering people, simply because they hadnt voted in the last couple of elections. The Columbus Dispatch reported on October 2nd:\u000a The news release said, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted today announced his office will begin mailing absentee ballot applications to voters statewide this weekend. What it didnt say was that more than a million of Ohios 7.7 million registered voters wouldnt get the mailing, because Husteds office had pared the list beforehand. \u000a One who did not receive an application was Al Rosenfield  husband of Peg Rosenfield, elections specialist with the Ohio League of Women Voters  who has cast ballots for 42 straight years. I was surprised when my wife got an absentee ballot application in the mail, but I did not, he said. I have never missed voting in an election since at least 1974. \u000a The secretary of states office said Al Rosenfield was supposed to receive application as well, but acknowledged that some get lost in the mail. \u000a Peg Rosenfield said she and her husband helped residents of Thurber Tower, a residence for seniors, check their voter registrations. Three people said they had not received an application even though a check found their voter registrations were up to date. \u000aIt was found that he was purging people illegally, said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper, he was literally picking people to take off the rolls because they had voted infrequently. \u000aFederal elections are regulated by Congress under the US Constitutions elections clause, and state officials who violate those laws can be subjected to serious penalties. \u000aIts unfortunate that Ohios Secretary of State put party above duty, and intentionally purged voter rolls, then failed to deliver his states voters their absentee ballots in a timely fashion.\u000aEven with all of those obstacles, Democratic party leaders report a strong early voting turnout and a sense of optimism they say the opposing partys voter turn out lacks for this years presidential election.\u000aHeres a copy of the Democratic Coalitions complaint:

VMelania Trump, wife of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, delivers a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. (crecit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\u000aFollow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter\u000aBERWYN, Pa. (AP) C Donald Trumps wife, Melania, made a rare appearance on the campaign trail on Thursday, pledging to focus on combatting online bullying and serve as an advocate for women and children if her husband is elected to the White House.\u000aHer description of the perils of social media seemed at odds with her husbands divisive and bullying rhetoric throughout the campaign.\u000aOur culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers, said Mrs. Trump, delivering a get-out-the-vote speech in the Philadelphia suburbs with less than a week to go before Election Day. It is never okay when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked in the school yard, she argued, but it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. \u000aWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other, she said.\u000aThe highly personal speech, which also touched on conversations with her young son, her marriage and her own experience as an immigrant, appeared aimed at humanizing her husband in front of an audience of suburban women who are critical to Trumps hopes in Pennsylvania and other key states.\u000aFor years, Trump has used his Twitter account to berate and insult his rivals along with reporters, pundits and others who he feels have slighted him. Some educators have even described a so-called Trump effect increase in bullying inspired by Trumps bombastic rhetoric.\u000aNonetheless, Mrs. Trump told the audience, We need to teach our youth American values: kindness, honesty, respect, compassion, charity, understanding, cooperation.\u000aThe appearance came as Trumps rival Hillary Clinton and her allies have tried to paint the Republican nominee as anti-women, a strategy Democrats see as the best hope for rattling him and driving female voters away.\u000aThursdays speech at the Main Line Sports Center was Mrs. Trumps first since she addressed the Republican National Convention in July. That speech was well-received initially, but was quickly overshadowed by the discovery that sections had been plagiarized from first lady Michelle Obamas address to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\u000aWhile Mrs. Trump has given several television interviews and appeared by her husbands side at events, the former model is more often seen than heard. She explains her frequent absence from the campaign trail by saying her priority is raising the couples 10-year-old son, Barron.\u000aIn her remarks, Mrs. Trump described her husband as a fighter, beholden to no one, who will never give up.\u000aHe certainly knows how to shake things up, doesnt he? she joked.\u000aShe also spent time describing how, growing up in her native Slovenia, America was the word for freedom and opportunity. America meant: If you could dream it, you could become it.\u000aReceiving U.S. citizenship after a 10-year process, she said, was the greatest privilege in the world.\u000aThere were plenty of Women for Trump signs in the crowd of several hundred, who repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Trumps 10-minute speech with cheers and applause. Throughout the audience were the suburban women whose votes Trump hopes to shore up on a path to victory Tuesday.\u000aKris Goodman, 65, of Berwyn, said she believes Mrs. Trump would be a great first lady and an asset to her husband in the White House. Goodman, who has already voted absentee for the Republican nominee, said she was impressed with Trumps wife at the convention this summer.\u000aI think both she and (Trumps daughter) Ivanka are great examples of women of this century, Goodman said. Whats in the media, I dont think portrays his record and how he deals with women.\u000aIn addition to his wife, Trumps four oldest children have also been campaigning across the country, along with supporters like House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\u000aMeanwhile, Clintons campaign has deployed her husband, former President Bill Clinton, along with President Barack Obama, Mrs. Obama and a long list of celebrity backers to help her get out the vote.

VWASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 10: President-elect Donald Trump walks from a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the U.S. Capitol November 10, 2016 in Washington, DC. Earlier in the day president-elect Trump met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aPresident-elect Donald Trump signaled Friday he was open to keeping parts of Obamacare intact despite repeatedly vowing on the campaign trail to "repeal and replace" the program.\u000a\u000aHis remarks -- including his comment that he was persuaded by Obama earlier in the week to take another look at maintaining some of the program -- came as he has appeared to hedge on other campaign promises just days after winning the presidency.\u000a\u000aHere's a look at a few other areas where President-elect Trump is seemingly backing away from Candidate Trump.\u000a\u000aTrump has previously called Obamacare a "disaster." But, he told the Wall Street Journal , "I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that."\u000a\u000aIn an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes" that aired later Friday, he specifically talked about the need to continue coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000a"Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets," Trump told Leslie Stahl.\u000a\u000aTrump also said he'd try to keep the measure that allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.\u000a\u000a"We're going to very much try to keep that. It adds cost but it's very much something we're going to try to keep," Trump said.\u000a\u000aTrump's openness to compromising on Obamacare, however, was complicated Friday by a shift in the official positions listed on his website.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported that Trump has revised his health care agenda to steer it more in line with Republican Party orthodoxy.\u000a\u000aThe paper said the presidential transition website has been edited to now include allowing health care workers to not perform acts that would violate their religious or moral beliefs and to "protect innocent human life from conception to natural death."\u000a\u000aThe paper also said the website omits Trump's call to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from other countries where they are sold at lower prices.\u000a\u000aDuring the second presidential debate, Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate -- and convict -- the Democratic nominee over her use of a private email server.\u000a\u000aHis campaign rallies were also marked by chants of "Lock her up" as supporters clamored for Trump to jail his opponent.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to the Journal, however, Trump seemed to be less committed to the idea.\u000a\u000a"It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform," he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier in the week, top Trump surrogates Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie also seemed to back away from the idea\u000a\u000aTrump drew outrage last year when he called for a "shutdown" of Muslim immigration to the US. He later amended the plan, calling for "extreme vetting" and a shutdown on immigration from countries compromised by terrorism, but he never refuted his original policy and in July called the new iteration of his plan an "expansion" of his original Muslim ban.\u000a\u000aAppearing on Capitol Hill Thursday to discuss his legislative agenda, Trump was asked by a reporter if he would "ask Congress to ban all Muslims from entering the country."\u000a\u000aTrump appeared to hear the question but walked away after thanking everybody.

VIts hard to believe that there are actually people out there who would give up on a dog simply because they think hes too depressing to be around; because when you look at little baby Simba, it becomes painfully obvious that this puppy is only sad because something is horribly wrong inside of his little body. \u000aInstead of taking the little puppy to the vet, they decided to throw him away like garbage. Just when he needed the love and help of a human more than ever, they abandoned him, and said that this hopeless little dog needed to be euthanized simply because he refused to play. \u000aThankfully, little Simba was rescued from his high kill shelter, and the doctors and vets realized he had a tick on him, and saw something strange. This poor little dog was suffering from a tick fever and a multitude of other sicknesses that had totally wrecked his energy. \u000aIts no surprise that he didnt want to play, with the constant fever beating him down so hard. Its hard to believe that this little angel somehow managed to stand up and walk on his two legs! Even Simbas friend who is also in the kennel looks depressed and weak, but it should be noted that he gets saved too! \u000aThankfully, the doctors set him up with a good and healthy way to recover. While hes got quite a lot of work ahead of him until hes totally back to normal, something tells us that with his new foster family, hell become strong again, learn how to play again, and eventually find a loving forever home who would never abandon him in his moment of need! \u000aVideo Credit: Sidewalk Specials.

Plus, as audiences know all too well, cancellations arent always predictable. While some seem doomed right from the start, others remain on the bubble for some time (Sleepy Hollow, Bones).\u000aIn the coming months, all five major networks will have to decide which entries from their lineup  from sitcoms to to fantasy dramas  will get officially pulled.

The show, hosted by Maya Rudolph and Martin Short, features various comedy sketches, musical performances, and celebrity guests. Though its premiere garnered a solid 6.26 million viewers, ratings declined quickly, with the sixth and final episode dipping down to only 3.94 million viewers. With lackluster ratings and equally mixed reviews, NBC may not want to take another chance on Maya and Marty.

VWrestling \u000aRoman Reigns has had an interesting year because hes been high and low, but he continues to find success despite the mixed reaction he receives from the WWE Universe. He began the year as the WWE Champion and main evented Wrestlemania 32 with Triple H. Unfortunately; a WWE Wellness Policy violation caused him to float around until the feud with Rusev gave him the chance to become the United States Champion.\u000aThe ridicule for Reigns subsided once he left the WWE Universal title picture because there is a strong belief that the WWE Universe will never fully accept him as the WWE Universal or World Champion because they refuse to embrace him as WWEs top face. However, becoming the US Champion has given Reigns a little bit more consistency with the fans as a face. His dynamic with the WWE fans will be tested again in December.\u000aBased on the past few weeks of WWE television heading into WWE Survivor Series, its being reported that Roman Reigns will be reentering the WWE Universal title picture and is expected to challenge Kevin Owens for the championship heading into WWE Roadblock. Before that can happen, some recent news needs to be cleared up because the WWE Universe is wondering about Romans status in WWE after yesterdays report.\u000a[Image by WWE]\u000aIt was reported last night that Reigns was being pulled from the remaining dates of WWEs European tour, but the speculation as to why has some people wondering if hes in trouble again with WWE officials. Being pulled from the tour doesnt look good at first glance, especially considering his issue earlier this year with WWEs Wellness Policy, but there is a specific reason why Roman Reigns was pulled from the tour dates.\u000aAccording to a new report, Roman was pulled from the remaining dates for WWEs European tour because of previous family commitments. Those commitments havent been revealed, and they likely wont be due to the right for him and his familys privacy. The belief is its not anything serious and Roman wont be missing any time on WWE programming, but being in Europe created a problem that forced him to go home early.\u000aThe WWE Universe may not be thrilled about Owens vs. Reigns continuing as planned, but their feud is classic face versus heel, and theyll be able to have good matches in the ring heading into 2017. Their feud will also be very important in developing Raw and WWE television heading into the WWE Royal Rumble and The Road to Wrestlemania. There is still a lot of speculation about exactly what WWE has planned.\u000a[Image by WWE]\u000aFor instance, one of the biggest questions heading into the biggest shows of the year is who will be the WWE Universal Champion? Its been reported in the past that Brock Lesnar will be challenging for the title at the WWE Royal Rumble PPV in January. There is speculation that hell be winning the championship at that PPV, so the feud between Owens and Reigns could be about who will go on to face Lesnar in that big match.\u000aWWE booking the rematch from Wrestlemania 31 between Lesnar and Reigns would be great for the PPV and is something WWE officials could definitely do. On the other hand, the WWE Universe has wanted to see Lesnar vs. Owens for some time, and the WWE Royal Rumble could be the perfect situation to make it happen. The only question is what Roman Reigns would be doing at the three biggest PPVs of the year.\u000aThere have been rumors about The Shield reuniting for a short run in 2017 with Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose all being faces for the first time since the stables split. Not only that but a lot of people think a Shield reunion could do wonders to improve the dynamic between Roman and the WWE Universe. At the same time, a potential match between Goldberg and Reigns has been rumored as well. The important thing to note here is that there is nothing to worry about for Roman Reigns in WWE right now.\u000aThe important thing to note is that there is nothing to worry about for Roman Reigns in WWE. There are several possibilities for him to have big matches over the coming months on WWE programming and beyond. WWE officials are just going to need to figure out where Roman fits into all the creative plans, but it seems like the United States title will be a part of whatever they have planned, so good work is being done.

VMom Doesnt Answer The Door, So Delivery Man Calls Child Protective Services On Her\u000a\u000aIt was unbelievable: one snap judgment left a mother from Connecticut shaken to her core. Patty Levreault was home with the kids one morning.\u000a\u000aHer son and daughter were watching some television in the living room when the doorbell rang.\u000a\u000aStill in her pajamas, Levreault saw that it was a delivery man and didnt feel like answering the door.\u000a\u000aI was just like, okay, well, Im going to see if he leaves his package on the porch, Levreaulttold ABC News. I went to the bathroom and five minutes later, three cop cars showed up.\u000a\u000aThe delivery person believed her two children were home alone and reported her to child services.\u000a\u000aLevreault feared she could go to jail or have her children taken away.\u000a\u000aI was mortified, said Levreault.\u000a\u000aLevreault believes the incident is a part of a larger trend called parent shaming.?Its when strangers make quick judgments about other parents without having all of the necessary information to make those judgments. Its as though parents are expected to be perfect 100 percent of the time, and others are looking for reasons to point out their shortcomings.\u000a\u000aPeople are shamed today for letting their child play in front of their house in an unfenced yard and letting a child walk to school alone, said Dana Points, Editor-in-Chief of Parents magazine.\u000a\u000aNew data reveals that the majority of calls to Child Protective Services are unfounded.

VStephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors reacts after making a three-pointer against the New Orleans Pelicans at ORACLE Arena on November 7, 2016 in Oakland, California.\u000aGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry made another NBA league record by making the most three-pointers in a game with 13 shots hit during the Warriors game with the New Orleans Pelicans, which the former defeated, 116-106. Curry erased the records of Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall who registered 12 three-pointers in 2013 and 2005, respectively.\u000aThe two-time reigning MVPs record-setting shot was achieved less than two minutes before the game ended. Stephen Curry leads the Golden State Warriors with a season high 46-points. Curry had 16-for-26 overall, with five assists and five rebounds.\u000aFor Stephen Curry, the game against the Pelicans was a special night. It was also a rebound from his dismal shooting performance during the Warriors 117-97 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night. Curry missed ten threes and ended his 157-game regular-season streak of 3-pointers, which is an NBA record.\u000aIn 2015, Stephen Curry made 402 three-points, shattering his 2014 record of 286. Almost a week ago, Curry surpassed Ray Allens NBA record as the leagues fastest player to make 1600 three points. He made that record during another game with the Pelicans, which the Warriors trounced, 122-114.\u000a In an interview with reporters, Curry shared that"It was nice to make the first one after last game. He added that The last three was very special, with the flow of the game, and it being kinda close. I made one or two tough ones, and the last one was a heat check, just to see if it goes in or not. Thankfully it did.\u000aSports Illustrated compiled a list of how Stephen Curry has dominated the NBAs record books when it comes to shooting from the rainbow country. The Golden State Warriors win over the Pelicans has improved its NBA standing to 5-2, with the two losses attributed to the San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers.

VNews \u000aDonald Trump is already planning to spend as little time in the White House as possible. The president-elect has lived the last 30 years in his grandiose, eponymous Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York and Trump doesnt want his living situation to change just because hes president.\u000aAccording to the New York Times, Trump is already in talks with his advisers to see how many nights a week he has to stay in the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump would fly for hours to make it back to Trump Tower even when the president-elect was faced with a grueling schedule. Now, Trump is resistant to staying where 44 presidents have lived and worked before him.\u000aThe move to Washington D.C. requires a number of different considerations for Trump, his family, and his business. The Washington Post reports that Trumps various businesses will be run by his his adult children via a blind trust, but Trump also has a 10-year-old son, Barron, who stood next to him during his acceptance speech on election night. Barron is currently in the middle of a school year in New York, so an immediate move may be unsavory for the Trump family.\u000aHowever, President Barack Obamas daughters, Sasha and Malia, moved into the White House in 2009 after inauguration day. Trump has a number of properties around the country including Trump Tower in New York, his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida, and his golf course in New Jersey, all of which are some of the president-elects favorite destinations.\u000aTrump Tower and the various other Trump buildings in Chicago, Las Vegas, and Washington D.C. had become more iconic than the man himself before Trumps presidential run. Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Trumps prize possession, began construction in 1979 and was completed in 1983. Trump has lived and worked in the mammoth skyscraper since its completion in the early 80s, but the president-elect is reluctant to give the same dedication to the White House.\u000aWhen Trump Tower began construction it started out as the old Bonwit Teller department store. The structure was considered an architectural masterpiece featuring bronze work, hammered aluminum, and twinkling glass. The Bonwit Teller building also featured two bas-relief sculpture panels that the New York community begged now president-elect Trump to save in the early years of construction.\u000aExtra security has been added to Trump Tower since protests erupted after Donald Trumps election. [Image by Richard Drew/AP Images]\u000aAccording to Newsweek, Trump ordered that the historic bas-reliefs be smashed to pieces because trying to preserve them would slow down labor and cost him to much money. Trump, who at the time was pretending to be his own spokesperson, John Barron, said that saving the reliefs would have cost him $32,000 and that the sculptures actually had no artistic merit despite the public outcry from professional art curators.\u000aPresident-elect Trump loves any reason to brag about Trump Tower. The buildings design features 24-karat gold and marble in an opulent style and Trump has his own private elevator that takes him from his 58th floor apartment to his office on the 26th floor. I really wanted to see if it could be done, Trump told biographer Michael DAntonio during a 2014 visit. This is a very complex unit. Building this unit, if you look at the columns and the carvings, this building, this unit was harder than building the building itself.\u000aTrumps love for his tower hasnt waned since he became president-elect. After meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday, the New Yorker inevitably flew back to Trump Tower instead of staying in Washington D.C. However, since Trumps election, special precautions have had to be enacted to protect Trump and his New York home.\u000aDocumentary filmmaker Michael Moore as he walks through Trump Tower. [Image by Andres Kudacki/AP Images]\u000aAlthough Trump Tower is considered a public building, there are now security checkpoints, metal detectors, and the secret service agents inside. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore discovered this when he went to visit president-elect Trump as an act of protest. The Bowling For Columbine creator was blocked off by the secret service and told to talk to Trumps team about a meeting.\u000aBecause extra security and personnel is required, most presidents choose to live at the White House for their own convenience and the convenience of their staff. However, Trumps love for Trump Tower may supersede his responsibilities to anything else during his time as president.

Vouth Korean President Park Geun-hye faced mounting calls to step down as a record number of people at a massive rally on Saturday criticised her as unfit to rule over allegations she allowed a friend to meddle in state affairs and wield influence.\u000a\u000aThe protest rally in downtown Seoul drew more than half a million people, according to its organisers, many of whom were ordinary citizens who packed the main streets running through the city centre including a 12-lane thoroughfare.\u000a\u000aThey came with family, and students and young parents pushing strollers were among the crowd as were people in wheelchairs and crutches, in a sharp contrast from some previous rallies often dominated by militant unions and civic groups that had turned violent and clashed with police.\u000a\u000aThey chanted "Step down, step down, you must step down."\u000a\u000aProtesters gather during an anti-government rally in central Seoul\u000a\u000a"Of course she must step down," Jung Sun-hee, a 42-year-old homemaker who attended the rally with her husband and two pre-teen daughters, said. "I believe we need a new person to break through this situation, who will be better than this one."\u000a\u000ahe crowd has been given a go-ahead by the court to march later in the evening to within a few blocks of the presidential Blue House compound, which had been previously disallowed by the police, citing security reasons.\u000a\u000aIt was the third weekend protest rally since Park's first public apology on October?25 where she admitted she had sought the advice of her friend, Choi Soon-sil, which only fuelled public anger and suspicion over the secret confidant who apparently held no official government position.\u000a\u000aTens of thousands of protesters hold up signs calling for the resignation of South Korean President Park Geun-Hy\u000a\u000another apology by Park and an offer to work with the parliamentary opposition to form a new cabinet and relinquish some power failed to calm public anger, prompting her opponents to say she did not grasp the gravity of the crisis at hand.\u000a\u000aMembers of main opposition parties joined the rally calling on Park to resign, indicating there was a growing opinion in parliament to take action to remove her from power, although there was no formal move yet to launch impeachment proceedings.\u000a\u000aSouth Korean people shout slogans as they carry placards reading 'Park Geun-Hye Out'\u000a\u000aark's approval rating has dropped to 5 percent for a second week, according to a poll conducted by Gallup Korea and released on Friday, the lowest number for a South Korean president since such polling began under democratically elected leaders in 1988.\u000a\u000aGallup Korea, based in Seoul, is not affiliated with US-based Gallup, Inc.\u000a\u000aNo South Korean president has ever failed to finish their five-year term, but Park has faced growing pressure from the public and political opponents to quit.\u000a\u000aA South Korean wears face paint and shouts slogans during the protest?\u000a\u000aark has dismissed some of her most senior and closest advisers, and former aides have been arrested on charges of abuse of power. Choi, the friend who is believed to have been acquainted with the president since the 1970s, has been charged with abuse of power and fraud.

VI wish I thought our fashionably liberal ruling classes, throughout what remains of the free world, would learn from the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. But they wont. They are incapable of learning anything, ever.\u000aAfter years of taunting, spiting, ignoring and scorning the rest of us and our opinions, they have now created a monster. President Trump is entirely their fault. But they blame others.\u000aI have politely warned the liberal elite for years that they were taking this risk. I have many times said and written to such people: Please listen to me now. Or you will end up having to listen to someone much, much nastier in future.\u000aThe liberal ruling classes will not learn from the election of new US President Donald Trump, writes Peter Hitchens\u000aThey paid no attention to my careful dissection of their wrong policies. With very few exceptions, they treated me as either mad or wicked, much as they treat your opinions and concerns.\u000aOn they ploughed with their mass immigration, their diversity and equality, their contempt for lifelong, stable marriage, their refusal to punish crime, their mad, idealistic foreign wars, their indulgence of drugs, their scorn for patriotism, their schools and universities, turning out graduates with certificates they can barely read.\u000aAnd on they went with their destruction of real jobs, promising a new globalised prosperity that never came. Millions have just had too much of this.\u000aEven now the liberals squawk and gibber in a state of disbelief. They hold daft placards saying Love Trumps Hate, as if they have not for years hated the secret, inarticulate people, living in parts of the country they never visit and barely know exist, who have finally let rip with a yell of resentment and rage.\u000aThis yahoo, this bully, this groper, a man who threatened his opponent with jail, he surely cannot be preparing to live in the White House? Yes, he is. Those pictures of Barack Obama treating him with polite respect, they cannot be 1? Yes, they are.\u000aThese ridiculous people, who have never wondered how others have viewed their own sides billionaire-financed election victories in the past, are actually holding demonstrations against the result. I loathe Mr Trump for his coarseness, his crudity, and his scorn for morals, tradition and law. I am as sorry that he has won as they are, and fear that Britain will have its own Trump before long. But I can at least say that I tried to prevent it. They brought it about. We must all now wonder if he is what he claims to be, or just another politician prepared to say anything to win office, just a bit more shameless than the rest.\u000aNeither of these possibilities is good. If he is what he says he is, and keeps his promises, then he is bound to do grave damage to the peace and stability of the USA.\u000aLiberals can barely believe that the pictures of Barack Obama meeting Donald Trump with apparent polite respect are real, writes Peter Hitchens\u000aThe simplest test of that will be whether he tries to put Hillary Clinton in prison, the promise he made that most pleased his supporters. If he does not, then he is like a medieval wizard who has conjured up the Devil and now does not know how to send him back where he came from.\u000aMr Trump has so stirred the mob that they cannot be relied on to go home if he fails them.\u000aThey want the change and the revenge they were promised.\u000aIf they see that they will not get them, they will instead rally behind figures who will make Donald Trump look like John Major.\u000aAnd this campaign has done so much damage to the USA, to its tolerance, to respect for the rule of law, to civility, that there is no telling where this may stop.\u000aSurely the most moving words written or spoken by anyone in the past year were Leonard Cohens message to his one-time lover Marianne Ihlen, when he learned that she was dying: Know that I am so close behind you that, if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. And so he was, as we learned on Friday.\u000aSet that beside the florid, bombastic attempts of politicians and preachers to move us, which fail. Note that almost every simple word has only one syllable.\u000aWhat makes it so powerful is that he meant it.\u000aBrace yourself for a cold, dark winter\u000aThis could be the winter when our crazed policy of closing coal-fired power stations and building windmills finally produces the power cuts that we richly deserve. In a way, I hope it is. It might make us wake up before things get much worse.\u000aGreen dogma is quite a bit dafter than the beliefs of the Mormons that fashionable people like to mock. That is why I call these fanatics Warmons. \u000aBut it has taken over the minds of our politicians and civil servants to such an extent that C on this issue C our official policy is as crazy as anything in North Korea. \u000a YES, IT'S BITTER - BUT AMY'S NEW THRILLER IS BRILLIANT  \u000aAs long as you keep your eyes closed through the opening credits (which feature several rather large naked women doing performance art), by far the best film of the year is Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams, left, and crammed with real suspense. \u000aAs a bonus, the film is also a strong, if bitter, argument in favour of constancy and fidelity, things Hollywood hasnt always been keen on lately.\u000aUS actress Amy Adams stars in the best film of the year, Nocturnal Animals\u000aLet me sum it up. On the basis of an unproven theory about global warming, we are shutting down perfectly sound, high-capacity, coal-fired power stations and instead peppering the country with windmills that tend not to work when it is cold. \u000aThis is unhinged anyway. But since China builds a new coal-fired power station every few weeks, and we share the same atmosphere as China, this action does no good, even if you believe the theory. \u000aIn any case, our ability to cope with big surges of demand in a cold winter gets less all the time. Our nuclear generators are near the end of their lives. \u000aFrances nuclear stations, which often fill the gap by sending French power under the Channel, are having problems of their own just now.\u000aIt could be that the only way to meet demand will be by activating reserve banks of diesel generators now on standby, perhaps the most polluting form of power there is.\u000aThe closure of coal-fired stations should stop now, and we should also immediately build new gas-fired plants in defiance of the Warmon fanatics. Our exit from the EU actually makes this much easier.

VPresident-elect Donald Trump, in his first television interview since beating Hillary Clinton in a historic election, apparently no longer thinks Clinton is "crooked." \u000a Trump immortalized the "Crooked Hillary" moniker he used to describe his Democratic opponent over more than a year of campaigning. He now says Clinton is a "very strong and very smart" woman. \u000a Trump made the comments during an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes," set to air Sunday. He talked about the concession phone call he received from Clinton in the early hours of Wednesday morning, after it became clear that he would win the White House: \u000a "It was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her," Trump said. "She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, 'Congratulations, Donald. Well done.'" \u000a During a heated election campaign, Trump attached several different nicknames to Clinton, including "Heartless Hillary," "Unstable Hillary Clinton," and "Lyin' Hillary."At the end of the final debate in October, Trump called Clinton a "nasty woman." \u000a The real-estate mogul had glowing praise for former president Bill Clinton as well, saying "He couldn't have been more gracious," in a phone call the two men had after Trump won. The Trump campaign targeted Bill at the height of the election - reintroducing decades-old sexual misconduct allegations against him to damage Hillary. \u000a After his conversation with the former president, Trump called him "Very, very, really very nice." \u000a Since the election, Trump appeared to be trying to polish up his image. After tweeting on Thursday that the  thousands of anti-Trump protesters demonstrating nationwide were professionals "incited by the media," he followed that up hours later in a toned-down tweet: "Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country." \u000a Supporters may not be pleased with all of the changes, however. Appearing to defy a campaign goal to "drain the swamp" of cronyism in Washington, Trump stacked his White House transition team  with Washington lobbyists and insiders. \u000a Watch a portion of the interview below:

VClinton said her campaign was winning until FBI director revived her email scandal days before of the election [EPA]\u000aHillary Clinton has blamed the FBI's decision to revive an investigation into her email accounts for her devastating defeat in the US presidential election.\u000aIn a call on Saturday with top campaign donors, Clinton said her campaign was in the lead until FBI director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on October 28 announcing that the FBI had uncovered emails possibly related to its earlier probe into her use of a private server as secretary of state.\u000aThe new examination was sparked by an unrelated investigation into former New York Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of her top aides.\u000aUS election: How did Hillary Clinton lose?\u000aThe surprise announcement by the FBI came after three debates in which president-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, was widely panned for his performance. Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state and was tied in Arizona, a traditionally Republican stronghold, until Comey released his letter.\u000aTrump's campaign and Republican supporters seized on the news, even though it was unclear whether Clinton's correspondence was tied up in the probe.\u000aComey told lawmakers the Sunday before the election that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges. His "all clear" message only served to further motivate Trump supporters, Clinton told donors on the call.\u000aIn the nine days between Comey's initial statement and his "all clear" announcement, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That was roughly 18 percent of the expected total votes for president.\u000aWhile Clinton accepted some blame of her loss, said donors who listened to her call, she made little mention of the many other factors political analysts saw as driving Trump's victory.\u000aClinton told her supporters on Saturday that her team had drafted a memo that looked at the changing opinion polls leading up to the election and that the letter from Comey proved to be a turning point. \u000aThe memo prepared by Clinton's campaign, a copy of which was seen by the Reuters news agency, said voters who decided which candidate to support in the last week were more likely to support Trump than Clinton.\u000a"In the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome," the memo concluded.\u000aA spokesperson for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.\u000aDemocrats have spent much of this week reeling for their loss, with many in the party beginning a process of soul-searching designed to figure out what exactly went wrong. Liberals like Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren say Democrats must embrace a more aggressive economic message  one Clinton largely shied away from during her campaign.\u000aSource: News Agencies

VReena Roberts and her husband, Mike, went in for an ultrasound. Even the Missouri couples sonogram tech didnt quite understand what the father-to-be was seeing. \u000aMike knew that his eyes were not fooling him: She was not pregnant with a baby, but she was clearly expecting a car! The couple couldnt help but have a long laugh about it. \u000aWhile many parents believe they see angels or blessings in their ultrasounds, this family seems to have the premonition of a new car! \u000aMike shared the photo on Reddit, and the image quickly went viral as commenters tried to determine which car it was. \u000aSome suggested it was a Nissan 370Z, while less-impressed posters joked that it was merely a PT Cruiser. \u000aWe know its a boy car, Reena told CNN. Mike likes to think of the car in the oven as a new Bugatti, one of the most expensive cars in the world. One thing is for sure, whether the kid joins NASCAR or not, I am sure hell get quite the chuckle out of knowing he was famous before he was even born! \u000aMom has a pretty good nickname for her unborn son as well, calling him the all-new Ford Fetus. It definitely has a ring to it, dont you think? Have you ever encountered any bizarre ultrasound photos? \u000aLet us know in the comments. \u000aPlease SHARE this story if it put a smile on your face today!

VTV \u000aIn a new Teen Mom OG sneak peek for this weeks episode, Farrah Abraham and her mother Debra Danielson get into yet another heated screaming match on-camera. In the new clip for the hit MTV reality TV series, Farraah and her mom rehash the details of the real reason behind Debras arrest on assault charges six years ago.\u000aThe mother and daughter duo have always bickered and fought on camera, but this argument is the most explosive one yet, Ok Magazine reported. In new Teen Mom OG sneak peek, Debra is visiting at her daughter Farrahs home in Texas and they experienced a major breakdown in communication when their conversation about they way that they communicate with each other quickly escalated to a screaming match and ends with Farrah running away in tears.\u000aThe Teen Mom OG sneak peek opened with a shot of Farrah sitting down at her kitchen counter typing away on her laptop. Debra approached her daughter and told her that she didnt want their conversation to turn into an argument or a fight.\u000aWell I honestly just feel like rolling my eyes when I hear it. I cant even like continually hear it, Farrah told her mother.\u000a Reality star @F1Abraham gets a consult for a new butt \u005cu0026 defends her parenting decisions. bit.ly/2cgqVYP\u000aA photo posted by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Sep 13, 2016 at 1:33pm PDT\u000aDebra asked Farrah what it was that made her want to roll her eyes and Farrah just mocked her mom, repeating her first sentence back to her. But her mom explained that they just has a different style of communicating, and Farrah told her mother that she should be able to just figure it out. But when Debra told Farrah that she was trying to communicate with her, thats when Farrahs explosive temper flared.\u000aYou wanna know where my f**king frustration comes from right now and Im so f**king annoyed? Farrah said, cursing at her mom in the Teen Mom OG sneak peek.\u000aHer mother calmly asked her why she was swearing at her and she told her daughter that she did not want to swear at each other.\u000aYou know why I swear? Farrah snapped back. Because Im f**king over this.\u000aFarrah shouted and explained that she feels that between herself, her mother and her father Michael Abraham, shes the only one who is making an effort to improve their communication as a family and she also feels that she is the only one who is serious about taking steps towards that goal.\u000aBut her mom said she does take it seriously because she has undergone therapy sessions with Farrah. The mother-daughter duo have sought help from celebrity doctors like Dr. Drew, Dr. Phil and Dr. Jenn.\u000a Thank you @drjennmann for over the years constantly helping me become the better me, I love #relationshipfix thank you for signing my copy #relationshipgoals #austin\u000aA photo posted by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Oct 3, 2016 at 4:22pm PDT\u000aYeah, guess who pays for that? Farrah interrupted during the Teen Mom OG sneak peek. Guess who gets you there? Other parents show up because they wanna f**king be there and instead, I hear someone always saying I dont like Dean, I dont like Dr. Jenn, I dont like this, I dont like that, f**k them.\u000aFarrahs mom tried to tell her that she does like Dr. Drew, and she explained that sometimes doctors have their own problems that they are dealing with.\u000aYou know what? I dont give a f**k about their problems, Farrah told Debra in the Teen mom OG sneak peek. She said that the doctors are paid to listen to her problems and help her figure out solutions.\u000aDebra told Farrah that whatever happened in the past between them doesnt matter because they cant go back and change it. The only thing they can do is move forward and work on changing their relationship for the better.\u000aGuess what sweetheart? When you f**king hit me that day and you thought I wasnt gonna call the f**king cops, Farrah said, bringing up an incident that happened in 2010 when Farrah was still a teen. Farrah called the cops and had her mother arrested after her mother allegedly choked her and hit her during an argument, according to Us Weekly.\u000aI never hit you, her mom said.\u000aOh no dumb b****h, I hit myself, Farrah said, raising her voice even louder. Youre calling me a liar about that, that f**king happened. I f**king care about you, and you f**king called me a liar and thats why Im f**king pissed. Get the f**k out of my house.\u000aAfter she kicked her mom out, Farrah walked away in tears.\u000aWatch the full Teen Mom OG sneak peek below and be sure to catch the upcoming episode, airing Mondays at 9 p.m. on MTV.

VPresidents are elected according to the Electoral College system \u000aEach state is given a number of electoral votes based on their population\u000aFor example, a large state like California has 55 votes and a small one like South Dakota has five\u000aIn most states, presidents win all of a state's electoral votes if they win the popular vote in that state \u000aSo even if the votes are split nearly 50/50, the candidate who wins the majoirty wins all of the state's votes \u000aThat happened in Florida on Tuseday, when Trump won a thin 1 per cent margin over Clinton and won all 29 of the states electoral votes\u000aSystem has been criticized because it can lead to situation's like this year, when a candidate wins the popular vote, but loses the electoral vote \u000aSome Americans may have been confused as to why Donald Trump has been named the winner of the election, despite not winning the majority of the votes.\u000aThat's because candidates aren't elected in the U.S. based on the total number of votes. Rather, presidents are elected by the Electoral College, representatives from each state that cast votes on behalf of their constituents. \u000aEach state is given a certain amount of electoral votes, depending on their population. So a large and populous state like California has 55 electoral votes while a small state like North Dakota has just three.\u000aIn 48 states, electors must cast a vote for the candidate who wins the state's popular vote. So even if the votes are split nearly 50-50, as was the case in Florida Tuesday night, Trump still won all 29 of the states electoral votes because he won the popular vote by a thin margin. \u000aMaine and Nebraska are the exceptions to the rule, giving out electoral votes to each candidate proportionally, based on the results of the popular vote. \u000aThere have been complaints in recent years that this system is perhaps unfair, since it causes some votes to be weighted more than others. One of the issues is that voters in solidly-blue or red states are becoming discouraged to vote, if they are members of a rival party, since their vote likely won't be reflected in the states electoral votes. \u000aTake a Republican voter in Oregon on Tuesday, a state which has voted Democrat in the last four presidential elections. An Oregon Republican may not even bothered to turn in their ballot in because the chances of the state's seven electoral votes going to the Democratic nominee are high.\u000aIn addition to this year's election, this disconnect between popular votes and electoral votes has happened four other times in U.S. history - most recently in the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. \u000aIt also happened in 1824, when none of the four candidates running for president secured the plurality of the electoral college votes (you need to hit 270 to become president). \u000aIn that case, members of Congress cast their votes for president, and John Quincy Adams was elected president, despite Andrew Jackson having the most electoral votes and popular votes in the general election. \u000a U.S. ELECTIONS WHERE THE WINNER HAS LOST THE POPULAR VOTE  \u000aYEAR \u000aWINNER \u000a# OF VOTES \u000a# OF ELECTORAL VOTES \u000aLOWER \u000a# OF VOTES \u000a# OF ELECTORAL VOTES \u000a2016* \u000aDonald Trump (R)\u000a59,131,310 \u000a289 \u000aHillary Clinton (D) \u000a59,293,071 \u000a219 \u000a2000 \u000aGeorge W.

VArbys is getting plenty of buzz after Arbys announced on October 26 that they would begin selling venison  thats deer meat  in sandwiches for a limited time. Whereas the thought of eating deer would gross out some folks, others are apparently delighted and excited about Arbys decision to sell venison sandwiches.\u000a\u000aNot all Arbys stores will sell the deer sandwiches from October 31 to November 28  but Arbys stores in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Georgia are among the first states to get to try chomping down on Bambi.\u000a\u000aWhite-tailed deer  not the red deer of Arbys sandwiches [Image by Robert F. Bukaty/AP Images]\u000a\u000aAccording to the Tennessean, people in Nashville really loved the venison promotion at Arbys.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches, which are thick and chewy deer steak on a bun, sold out on the first day at the Arbys on Rosa Parks Blvd. That means the deer sandwiches that were supposed to sell all the way through till Thursday, November 3, ended up selling out immediately.\u000a\u000aSince that particular Nashville Arbys store was the very first one in the U.S. to begin selling the venison sandwiches, the sales of Arbys deer sandwiches across the nation could end up being very popular.\u000a\u000aThat Arbys Nashville location sold 250 deer sandwiches in 5 hours, with certain Arbys customers driving an hour to get their venison sandwiches. After Nashville, the venison deer sandwiches move to an Arbys location in Atlanta this week.\u000a\u000aNext up, Arbys locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota get to try the deer sandwiches for their taste buds.\u000a\u000aNot all Arbys locations will get to serve their customers venison. Out of more than 3,300 Arbys stores, only 17 of them will sell the deer meat through November 3. Locations that were more deer-hunting friendly made the cut  with the venison coming from red deer from New Zealand.\u000a\u000aA doe and two fawns  not Arbys sandwiches [Image by Jim Fitzgerald/AP Images]\u000a\u000aArbys didnt sell shaved venison but instead sold 5.5-ounce cuts of top and bottom round venison steak  that were slow-cooked within baths of hot water. Arbys let each customer buy up to two venison sandwiches.\u000a\u000aThose folks who didnt find it gross to eat venison found the Arbys sandwiches pretty good  especially coupled with the fried onions on top. Definitely not a dinner for vegans, the venison sandwiches from Arbys were designed to attract hunters and a slice of the population that might not normally find themselves trekking to Arbys for lunch.\u000a\u000aThere will be six locations of Arbys stores in Pennsylvania that will offer the venison sandwiches, reports the\u000a\u000aThe only Arby's offering the venison sandwiches in Tennessee is in Nashville. https://t.co/IRoGBLhsUO\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, buzz about Arbys new venison sandwich with their thick-cut venison steak is heating up online. Some of the sample comments from social media about people eating deer meat thanks to Arbys limited promotion can be read below.\u000a\u000aI like venison. Just not from Arbys. Sounds like taking ones life into their hands.\u000a\u000aI want deer meat! Yes to venison at Arbys.\u000a\u000aId be wary since its Arbys but since its venison, I would definitely try it at least once.\u000a\u000aThe idea of factory farming venison for Arbys is a nauseating and horrific thought.\u000a\u000aEerie, came home to find deer in my driveway JUST AS radio was reporting on Arbys new venison burger :-P\u000a\u000aGonna drive to Pennsylvania for that venison sandwich at Arbys too.\u000a\u000aAn Arbys location in #Nashville sold out of their new venison sandwiches on the first day. Remind me never to go to Arbys.\u000a\u000aArbys: I was excited to try venison sandwiches in WI. But you did it in one place, hours away from 99% of people in the state. What a joke.\u000a\u000aSure hope Greenville Arbys gets the trial venison sandwich like Nashville did  sold out in 3 hours.

No one can believe it when we tell them. She is miles ahead of most babies her age.'\u000aDad Gavin, a builder, added: 'We are in absolute awe. She is the most amazing baby in the world.'\u000aExperts say that it's highly unusual for a baby that young to be able to use a potty with the majority becoming potty trained between 18 months and 32 months.\u000aMonika, who purchased the potty from Lidl earlier this month, added: 'We never dreamt she'd actually use it.\u000aMonika Nowak, aged 26, a full-time mothger, and Gavin Sanderson, aged 30, a construction worker, from Crewe, Cheshire, are delighted their first child can use a potty\u000aSpeaking about the fact that his little daughter can use a potty, her father said: 'We are in absolute awe. She is the most amazing baby in the world'\u000aBaby Emily-Rose on her potty\u000aSpeaking about trying to encourage her to use the potty, Monika said: 'We were just messing around really. But she looked so comfortable on the plastic potty we were a bit taken aback'\u000a'We were just buying it as it was cheap and we knew she'd need it in the future, but later that day we sat Emily-Rose on it with her clothes on.\u000a'We were just messing around really. But she looked so comfortable on the plastic potty we were a bit taken aback.'\u000aThe following day, they sat her on the potty but this time took her nappy off to see what would happen.\u000aMonika and Gavin watched as their daughter made noises to herself, followed by the sound of nature calling.\u000aThe proud parents said: 'We're just so proud of Emily-Rose.

The first couple of times we just sat her on it to see if she was happy, then we took her nappy off. She did her business right away and she was so happy about it.\u000a'Now when she wakes up at 6am the first thing she wants to do is use the potty. It's absolutely remarkable.'\u000aMonika said that Emily-Rose gives her or Gavin a signal by pointing to the potty and crying when she needs to go.\u000aShe added: 'The key is to leave the potty around as if it's just another toy, then they're intrigued to explore it.\u000a'Older babies get used to going in their nappies, and then suddenly the potty is brought into their lives and it seems all too daunting.'\u000a'We are so confident that she will tell us when she needs to go that we only use nappies at night now.'\u000aThe parents say that the key is to leave the potty around as if it's just another toy, then they're intrigued to explore it\u000aFirst-time dad Gavin says: 'We just couldn't believe it. The first couple of times we just sat her on it to see if she was happy, then we took her nappy off. She did her business right away and she was so happy about it'\u000aSpeaking about the tot's development, Angela Spencer, baby wellness expert, founder of Babyopathy.com and author of Babyopathy - baby care the natural way, said: 'Babies are amazing.

VPIQUA\u000aA previously convicted sex offender faces up to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty Thursday, Nov. 10, to two felony charges of rape of a 5-year-old boy.\u000aWilliam Thomas Baker, 44, of Piqua and formerly of Troy, initially was charged in September with 10 felony counts of rape.\u000aA report by Troy police said a Piqua police detective contacted them Sept. 7 about a possible rape involving Baker that allegedly occurred in Troy.\u000aPolice reported Baker told them that evening the initial contact with the child was accidental but that later incidents were not. The alleged abuse took place between June and August in Troy, according to the charges.\u000aAs part of a plea deal, Baker waived a Miami County grand jury hearing in Common Pleas Court on Thursday and pleaded to two first-degree felony counts of rape.\u000aAs part of the agreement, prosecutors will not file additional charges from the incidents, Judge Christopher Gee was told.\u000aBaker previously was convicted of sex offenses against a 10 year old and served four years in prison prior to release in 2005.\u000aGee explained to Baker that he faces up to 10 years to life on each of the two charges. If a consecutive sentence is ordered at the Dec. 27 sentencing, he could receive up to 20 years to life in prison.\u000aBaker also will be classified as a Tier III sex offender requiring lifetime registration of his address with the sheriffs office every 90 days after prison release.\u000aGee accepted Bakers guilty pleas and ordered a presentence investigation.

VWhen you buy a new set of wheels for your rig, the most important factor is looks. Thats OK. Aesthetics are important to everyone, and they are an important factor when you buy wheels, but they shouldnt be the only factor. Width, load rating, and offset are just a few of the other things you should consider when shopping for your next set of rims. To understand why these are important, we first must understand what they mean and how they apply to your 4x4. \u000aDiameter\u000a Large-diameter wheels are the trend right now, but both the wheels and the tires are more expensive than smaller-diameter offerings. Currently, 17-inch-diameter wheels have the most wheel and tire options and will fit over most brake packages. We typically like the wheel diameter to be less than half the overall tire diameter. For example, a 17-inch wheel would be the max for a 35-inch tire.\u000aWidth\u000a Tire manufacturers list a range of recommended wheel widths for each specific tire. They typically recommend a wheel that is 2-3 inches narrower than the tire. We like to run as narrow a wheel as recommended since this helps to keep the tire on the wheel at low air pressure. The tradeoff is that too narrow a wheel can cause the tire to crown, leading to accelerated wear in the center of the tread. \u000aOffset\u000a Offset refers to the wheels mounting surface relative to the centerline of the wheel. So a zero offset places half the wheel on each side of the mounting surface. Positive offset results in a narrower track width, with the mounting surface closer to the outside of the wheel. The opposite is 1 for negative-offset wheels.\u000aBackspacing\u000a Backspacing is similar to offset, but unlike offset, backspacing is dependent on the width of the wheel. Backspacing is the distance from the inside lip of the wheel to the mounting surface. Shallow backspacing is equivalent to negative offset, while deep backspacing is equivalent to positive offset. \u000aBolt Pattern\u000a The bolt pattern of your wheels needs to match your axles, although in some situations adapters are available to convert the bolt pattern. Most Jeeps use five-lug wheels, with current JKs being a 5-on-5 bolt pattern and earlier TJs and XJs being 5-on-4 1/2. The first number is the number of lugs, and the second number is the diameter in inches of the bolt circle.\u000aLoad Rating\u000a Tires arent the only things load rated; wheels are as well. Load rating is a function of the wheel construction and bolt pattern. Steel wheels are often rated at lower loads than cast aluminum wheels, while forged wheels offer the highest load rating. Regardless of the type of construction, a wheel with more lug nuts and a larger bolt circle (such as 8-on-6 1/2 instead of 5-on-4 1/2) will offer a higher load rating due to the distribution of the load.\u000aCenter Bore\u000a This refers to the hole in the middle of the wheel. The larger the bolt pattern circle is, the bigger the center bore can be, which is important when fitting over locking hubs and full-floating axles. On hub-centric wheels, the center bore is critical to position the wheel on the axle, unlike lug-centric wheels that use the lug nuts to center the wheel.\u000aBead Seat\u000a The bead seat on the wheel is what keeps the tire bead seated with the help of air pressure. The taller and wider this bead seat is, the lower the air pressure you can run without the tire coming off the wheel. Beadlock wheels add a mechanical clamp with bolts that hold the tire to the wheel (typically only on the outside bead), making it impossible for the tire to unseat even with zero air pressure.

VSteeped in a particularly potent brand of cyberpunk, as promised, the first full trailer for Ghost in the Shell has debuted online, welcoming Scarlett Johansson in the kick-ass role of Major Motoko Kusanagi C or The Major, for short.\u000aAn insightful featurette notwithstanding, this is our first extended look at Rupert Sanders manga adaptation in action, after Paramount opted for a non-traditional rollout of hypnotic teasers that showcased the overcrowded dystopia of Ghost in the Shell C cyborg criminals and rampant extremists included C and little else. That all changes with todays grand and truly epic reveal though.\u000aMORE NEWS FROM THE WEB\u000aAs for The Major, Johanssons character is a special ops cyborg, who spearheads an elite task force known as Section 9. Working under Hanka Robotics, theyre dispatched to rid the streets of dangerous criminals and, ultimately, The Laughing Man, though its still unclear if the ber-villain will make an appearance in the 2017 adaptation.\u000aWhat we do know is that Ghost in the Shell heralds another action-packed role for ScarJo following Lucy and Black Widow. Though there have been cries of whitewashing C many of which arent what one would label irrational C Johanssons character is said to be part of an international story, one that features Game of Thrones star Pilou Asb?k as Batou, The Majors trusted lieutenant.\u000aJuliette Binoche, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt and Kaori Momoi are also set to star, while the remaining members of Section 9 are to be filled out by Chin Han, Danusia Samal, Lasarus Ratuere, Yutaka Izumihara and Tuwanda Manyimo. Its an impressive cast to be sure, and under the confident direction of Rupert Sanders, we cant wait to see how it all comes together.\u000aGhost in the Shell is set to drop into theatres on March 31st, 2017. Take a look at the stunning first trailer above and leave us a comment letting us know if its got you excited for the film.

VA South Los Angeles, California, teacher was recorded telling students that their parents would be deported under a Donald Trump presidency.\u000aA sixth grade student at Bret Harte Preparatory Middle School recorded the substitute physical education teachers remarks on November 9  the day after Trump won the presidential election. Her family shared the recording with NBC4.\u000a"If you were born here, then your parents got to go. Then they will leave you behind, and you will be in foster care, the teacher allegedly said to Jennifer Reynagas 11-year-old daughter.\u000aReynaga expected backlash after Trump became president because of his proposed policy to deport undocumented immigrants, but not from a teacher.\u000a"I would think the kids would do it, but I never thought a teacher would do it," she said.\u000aReynagas daughter asked the teacher: How are they going to find me?, according to CBS Los Angeles. Of which he replied, I got your phone numbers, your address, your mamas address, your daddys address. Its all in the system, sweetie. And when they come and theres an illegal, they gotta go!\u000aThe teacher, who is reportedly a long-term substitute at the school, scared one student whose father is an undocumented immigrant.\u000aI was scared because how can a teacher tell us that. Hes just rubbing it in that Trump won. We already know that, the female student said. I worry about my dad because I had a nightmare that he wasnt with me any more.\u000aThe girl added that the teacher made the threats because students were not paying attention in class.\u000aOne students father questioned the teachers actions: I dont know how a teacher could say that to a kid?\u000aThe Reynagas' daughter and other students filed complaints against the teacher with the Los Angeles Unified School District.\u000aThe teacher has since been fired.\u000a"You have scared children," Steve Zimmer, board president of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said, according to NBC4. "One of most important things you can do is make sure that children who have qualified for [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)] know that they are safe and their status is secure."\u000aDACA, established in 2012, allows certain people who came to the United States as children with undocumented parents to receive a permit  renewable every two years  that allows them to legally remain in the country.\u000aUnder Trumps proposed immigration policy, it is unclear whether DACA will continue to exist.\u000a"There will be no amnesty," Trump said in September 2016 at a campaign event. "Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country."\u000aThe Public Policy Institute of California estimates that 13 percent of K-12 students in California have a parent who is an undocumented immigrant.

VBuzzWorthy \u000aHillary Clinton is going through a really hard time right now after losing the presidency to Donald Trump. Now the rumors are going wild on the Internet that she is actually going to divorce Bill Clinton. Snopes shared all about this big rumor that hit the Internet today and if it is 1 or not. The rumor flying is actually that Hillary filed for divorce from Bill. This would be pretty shocking if she finally gave up on their marriage after all of these years.\u000a.@HillaryClinton aides blame loss on everything but themselves https://t.co/xf5OMNBEc4 | Getty pic.twitter.com/MrBHLWFla3\u000a POLITICO (@politico) November 11, 2016\u000aAccording to Snopes, this is not 1 and Hillary Clinton is standing by her man. The rumor was started because the entertainment web site Christian Times Newspaper published a hoax news article saying that Hillary was filing for divorce. Of course, this went wild and started being shared all over. Everyone assumed that it was 1, but that isnt the case at all. Here is part of what the original report said, that isnt 1.\u000aBill Clinton just got served  by his own wife.\u000aAt approximately 9:18 a.m. on Thursday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.\u000aCiting irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillarys signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiffs signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.\u000aThe site that published this news about Hillary Clinton tries to look legit, but they arent. Instead, they are a site that posts fake news all the time. There is another site with a similar name that is legit news, though. This makes it hard for people who arent on these sites all the time to know what to believe. The real site is called Christian Times, but the one that posts fake news is called Christian Times Newspaper. They do have a disclaimer that everything on the site might not be 1, but they do their best.\u000aThis is not the first time that this site has posted fake news. Bill and Hillary Clinton are not getting a divorce, though. They are still married and he has been by her side during this campaign. She is going through a lot by losing out to Donald Trump, but her husband Bill doesnt seem to be going anywhere.\u000aYoung mom's chance encounter with Hillary Clinton will give you a boosthttps://t.co/w9yHBsaOmB pic.twitter.com/alezZ6zNSE\u000a HuffPostGoodNews (@goodnews) November 11, 2016\u000aUs Magazine shared that Bill Clinton was even seen spending time with his wife after her big loss. The couple went out for a hike along with their dogs. The two were seen out hiking near Westchester, New York. Hillary was seen wearing an oversized black hoodie, brown tight and black flats. They were spotted with Margot Gerstner and her daughter. She explained that she took her girls on the hike saying, Ive been feeling so heartbroken since yesterdays election and decided what better way to relax than take my girls hiking. So I decided to take them to one of [my] favorite places in Chappaqua. We were the only ones there and it was so beautiful and relaxing. Then of course, they ran into Bill and Hillary.\u000aHillary Clinton spoke out recently saying that she congratulated Donald Trump on his win. The country may be having a hard time handling what all went down, but these two seem to be handling the news okay. Hillary is moving on with her life and Donald is about to have a huge change as he becomes the next President of the United States.\u000aDid you hear that Hillary and Bill Clinton were getting a divorce? Did you believe that she was leaving him? Sound off in the comments section below on your thoughts.

VReady to reach for the stars in 2017? \u000aI know I am. \u000aBUT to achieve hopes, dreams and goals, there needs to be a method-to-the-madness. A how-am-I-going-to-master-this-plan. You can't get to a new destination without having some idea of the direction to head. I think thats where many people get themselves into a pickle. They have a grandiose dream, which is totally fine, but once they start implementing, they discover it takes, time, money, sweat and tears. Its at that point they typically lose much of their "oomph" and the dream gets tucked back in the closet for "some day."\u000aPeople also get themselves jammed up when:\u000a1. They don't know how to go about getting what they want.\u000a2. They waste time doing things that aren't aligned with their 1 passion.\u000a3. They do tasks or take on work that doesnt mesh with their personality.\u000a4. They let the Internal Doubt Monster talk them out of what they really want from life and business.\u000a5. They settle (they take the cheap, d-bag client because they are easy to get) and then become disheartened when the world is miserable and low-paying.\u000a6. They dont have any system of checks-and-balances or accountability that will keep them on track.\u000a7. They plow forward with no real plan of monetization or sustainability for their business or dreams.\u000aSound familiar? Here are some tips to help you not only kick butt this year, but to attain the stars you are reaching for:\u000aHave a plan. Have an End Game: Have a clear vision of your success and what that journey will look like. Throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks is never an effective strategy. Knowing the direction you need to head, and the To Dos you need to tick off your list to get there, is far better flailing about like a whirling dervish.\u000aCelebrate the Victories and Bucket List Accomplishments of 2016: I believe we will all appreciate our new ambitions more if we are aware of where we've been and how fa we've come in the last 12 months. I am proud to say that I accomplished some major victories and milestones this year including flying for the first time in 20+ years, experiencing the Great Smokey Mountains, writing for the Huffington Post and delving into the world of equine therapy. I can't wait to see what I conquer in 2017.\u000aDont Isolate: Build Relationships: I am the first to admit that, when working from home, there is a tendency to become a hermit. I personally get so caught up in the trap of hunkering down and grinding out work I forget to have a life beyond the four walls of my office. The result is the feeling of being alone on an island shouting, HEY, IS ANYONE THERE? You need to continually work to build connections (online and off-line) and actively participate in networking with Real Live Human Begins. Trust me, it sucks being lonely.\u000aLook for the JV: Joint Ventures, or JV, are beneficial to business but are also great ways to network, gain new customers and even learn new things. So, the big question is how to you build relationships with people youve never met? Ask to be included. There are a multitude of blogger link-ups, joint venture opps and Facebook Mastermind Groups to look in. If you see a series on a blog, or a reoccurring online or offline event, that youd like to be included in simply reach out to the admins of those blogs or events and ask.\u000aBe Seen: Social media is a great way to connect, be seen and drive traffic back to our sites, but it also needs to be practiced in a consistent way. Dont be the entrepreneur who shows up once a week dumps a load of tweets or retweets in a 15 minute span, only to disappear again for another week. Use third party tools like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule social media updates into the future to keep your coverage and visibility consistent. Commenting on other blogs is another ninja trick for great visibility and I mean REALLY commenting. Dont be that person who does a drive-by-comment by leaving something as lame and half-hearted as nice article. Engage and connect and build a relationship slowly and in an authentic way.\u000aGive Back: Are you a Giver or Receiver? I am a 1 Giver and helping others makes my heart sing. If you see someone struggling with something on social media or a blog that could use a little help, offer a friendly suggestion or help-no strings attached. If you see a new business who is trying their best to spread their wings and fly, offer them a guest post spot on your site or write it yourself. Not everything you do for others should have the underlying goal of making them a new customer. Share information, offer encouragement or even your time to those in need just because its the right thing to do.\u000aDon't Give In to the Naysayers and Criticizers: "They go low, we go high" is a kick-arse mantra from this last 2016 Election. Naysayers get under our skin because, like a shark that smells blood, they know how to prey on the negative self-talk that is always unfortunately rattling around in the back of our mind. If someone is being mean-spirited and hateful, chalk this up to someone who is unhappy in their own life and needs a Misery Buddy in their Pit of Despair. Shake it off, move on, walk away. Dont feed the trolls.\u000aFeed Your Brain: Every year I pick a topic (business or non-business related) that I want to know more about. In 2016 it was essential oils, fashion and podcasting. In 2017 it will be sales tactics, course writing and equine therapy. Fill and feed your brain with what it needs to explore this Big Ol' World we live in (and dont be afraid to spend $$ to do so). Education is an investment in your future; git 'er done.\u000aWhat will you do to clear the path so you can reach for the stars in 2017?

VCleveland Browns linebacker Jamie Collins (51), traded by the Patriots' Bill Belichick (right) last week, lets up a Cowboys touchdown.\u000aThe Patriots trade last Tuesday of starting linebacker Jamie Collins to the Browns for a compensatory third-round pick sent shockwaves through the league.\u000aWhile many thought it was a case of Bill Belichick and other Patriots brass not wanting to give Collins a big payday after the season, former Patriots employee Michael Lombardi, now a member of the media, said the move had more to do with Collins freelancing and lack of effort.\u000aFast forward to Sunday.\u000aCollins was lined up to cover Cowboys tight end Jason Witten on second-and-8 from the Browns 26. Collins let Witten pass him by, staying in his zone. He thought he had safety help, but there was no safety in the vicinity as Witten walked in for the touchdown.\u000aWitten escapes Jamie Collins' coverage.\u000aAnd @Dak takes advantage.\u000aEND ZONE. #DallasCowboys #DALvsCLE https://t.co/KUf1pOAc3S\u000a NFL (@NFL) November 6, 2016\u000aFOX announcers suggested the mistake could be the product of Collins being so new to the Browns. Maybe that was the case this time. But wherever he spent his bye week, Belichick had to be smiling.\u000aThere are reports the Patriots had other offers for Collins, and they certainly didnt do him any favors by sending him to Cleveland. The Browns now have allowed at least 25 points in each of their first nine games, becoming the first team to do that since the 1964 Broncos of the AFL.

VThis is one of the saddest stories, with one of the happiest endings. \u000aOlivia Sievers is a flight attendant from Germany. \u000aOne day while traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, she noticed a stray dog near her hotel. She fed the little guy and played with him for a while. She even named him Rubio. \u000aThen Rubio followed her to the hotel. For the next six months, Sievers would travel back and forth, each time staying at the same hotel where Rubio would be, right outside her door. If she was there for days at a time, Rubio would sleep outside. \u000aIt was almost as if he was waiting for her. But how did he know she would be there? \u000aAs she got to know Rubio, like anyone else would, Sievers wanted to help him to a greater extent. She arranged for Rubio to be adopted by someone in Buenos Aires. You would think getting him a forever home would solve things? \u000aNope. \u000aRubio escaped from his new home and went right back to the hotel. What was Sievers to do? The only thing she could do; she made things official. \u000aThe flight attendant adopted Rubio and took him home to Germany with her. Sometimes you go out looking for a furry companion, and sometimes hell find you. \u000aWe can only imagine that the life Rubio had before he met Sievers wasnt too great, considering he clung to that first small gesture of affection. However, as youll see in the video below, the precious dog has found 1 happiness with her.\u000aPlease SHARE to give Olivia Sievers the recognition she deserves for rescuing Rubio!

VMegyn Kelly.\u000aMegyn Kelly co-hosted Live With Kelly on Wednesday morning, just hours after Donald Trump was unexpectedly declared the winner of the presidential election.\u000aThe Fox News anchor revealed that shes never seen a result this shocking during her career as a journalist. Ive never seen anything like this and I dont think were ever going to see anything like this in our lifetimes, Kelly said, per CNN Money. I think youll never have a result this shocking, where people got it this shockingly wrong.\u000aKelly, who has been covering elections for Fox News since 2006, became a target of Trumps misogyny during the contentious campaign, with the candidate saying that Kelly had blood coming out of her wherever at the first GOP debate. Trump also retweeted a comment that Kelly is a bimbo, which prompted Fox Newss then-chairman Roger Ailes to condemn the candidates verbal assaultsagainst her. Ailes was fired from his position at Fox News over the summer after several women at the network accused him of sexual harassment, and Kelly has since accused Ailes of harassment, as well.\u000aWhen asked by Live host Kelly Ripa why the pollsters were so wrong about the election  which many people predicted would end in a Hillary Clinton presidency  Kelly explained that there was a hidden Trump vote:\u000a Some people felt stigmatized about voting for Donald Trump and didnt want to tell the pollsters who they were voting for but they did want to go into the polling booth and do what they felt was right. It was a resounding victory, theres no question about it. \u000aDespite the upset, however, Kelly called for unity and urged those fearing the impending Trump presidency to keep an open mind. She said, My philosophy in hard times or anytime you feel sort of blue or threatened or scared is remember who you are. What happens in the White House does not affect who you are, who your children are, whats most important to you in your life.

VOn the Sunday morning before Election Day, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first woman ever to be nominated by a major party for the American presidency, gave a sermon at the Mt. Airy Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia. Her voice hoarse after days of multistate campaigning, Clinton sounded exhausted but happy to be there. Even at the bitter end of a nearly two-year marathon campaign, she could still get energized by speaking at a black church on a Sunday.\u000a\u000aThere was a feeling of confidence among many in Clintons campaign that weekend. They were spending a lot of time in Philadelphia, where the streets were overrun by canvassers whod poured into the city to get out the vote. Polls had begun to show Clinton recovering from the dip shed taken afterFBI director James Comeys letter re-embroiled her in the email morass. It looked at that moment, in and out of the campaign, like she was going to be the first female president of the United States.\u000a\u000aClinton preached to the congregation about the Founding Fathers  but not in the way that most politicians, in this era of right-wing deification of the countrys forebears, would invoke them two days before a presidential election. Our Founders said all men are created equal, Clinton said. [But] they left out African-Americans. They left out women. They left out a lot of us.\u000a\u000aThe congregation stood, hands in the air, calling back to her. Our founders said our democracy should be shaped by We the People, but we didnt get to vote, did we? And even when the Constitution was amended to allow African-Americans to vote, it was still only men. And then, finally, when it was amended to allow women to vote, it took decades before that became a reality.\u000a\u000aClintons point was clear: Her historic candidacy, coming on the heels of the election and reelection of our first black president, offered another crucial revision to the countrys founding assumptions, another inversion of its exclusions. And if she were to win, it would be thanks to a coalition of voters of color and women, exactly the people who had had to fight for centuries for the franchise.\u000a\u000aThe next night,Clinton stood alongside Barack and Michelle Obama before a crowd of 33,000 people outside Philadelphias Independence Hall, the spot where the architects of the nation had endowed its citizens with the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness  as they built their new country on the backs of enslaved African-Americans and subsidiary women. Clinton and the Obamas were taking an audacious risk in presenting themselves as united in a mission to broaden Americas notions of what leadership could look like, of what the power of expanded enfranchisement could mean for the kinds of people from whom it was withheld for so long.\u000a\u000aBut little more than 24 hours after these three historic figures made their case for doing more work to perfect our imperfect union, it was clear that half of the country would prefer to return to the Founders original vision, with people of color and women on the margins and white men restored to their place at the center.The enormity of the upset came at the end of what had already beena traumatic election for the women and immigrants and people of color to whom Clinton was trying to appeal, and who had spent months being derided, threatened, groped, caricatured, insulted, and humiliated by Donald Trump and his supporters.\u000a\u000aIt wasnt simply that the imagined coalition did not, in the end, cohere  though it did not. It was also that the very specter of it, the threat that power could be wrested from those Americans who have traditionally enjoyed more than their share, had created a spasm of resentment and revulsion that no pollster had really been able to track. It wasnt just that white Americans voted Republican, which they usually do. Its that they chose a uniquely unqualified candidate who openly sold himself on promises of resistance to and revenge on the women and people of color who were poised to exert a historic degree of power.\u000a\u000aMonday-morning quarterbacks now litter the field, pointing out the one outlier poll, or their generalized conviction that Hillary was a terrible candidate, or that Trumps celebrity helped him, or that Clinton didnt visit Wisconsin enough, and that any one of these things makes Tuesdays outcome perfectly comprehensible.\u000a\u000aBut the argument that if Clinton had taken a firmer stand on trade, or spent more time in Green Bay, it would have mitigated the fact that 48 percent of voters chose a self-confessed sexual predator who wasendorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, attempts to apply reason where there is only visceral incongruity. Clinton was surely a flawed candidate; but Trump was a catastrophically awful one. The disparity is enough to make one wonder if she ever really had a chance.\u000a\u000aWe are a female-majority country that had never before nominated, much less elected, a woman president, and in which the administration of our first black president has been unapologetically delegitimized by members of his opposing party, led by our new president-elect. The resounding, surprising, data-defying victory of a man who ran on open racism and misogyny, and was voted into office by 63 percent of white men and 53 percent of white women voters, was made possible by voters threatened by the increased influence of women and people of color.\u000a\u000aOr, I should say, half of those who voted; though the tallies wont be final for months, it appears thatHillary Clinton won the popular vote. But the predominantly white, predominantly male 48 percent of voters who determined the electoral tally rejected her historic proposition, and the imagined coalition of Americans who might have supported it did not turn out  and in some states were successfully suppressed. The heartbreak of this election for Clinton supporters is not just the loss of a tough, smart, and inspiring first female president  though that is wrenching  but also the loss of the idea that this country was so very close to being better, more inclusive, more just, and more representative.\u000a\u000aAt a gathering of womens leaders and door-knockers hosted by EMILYs List in Philadelphia on the Friday before the election, the mood had been raucous. Tense and terrified, but excited. Clintons state director, Corey Dukes, who oversaw her win in Pennsylvania during the primary, took the stage: About a hundred hours from now, Hillary Rodham Clinton is gonna be named the 45th president of the United States.\u000a\u000aOh, shit! yelled a woman in the crowd with genuine shock. Was it just 100 hours? After more than 100 years?\u000a\u000aThe fact that this country has never managed to elect a woman to the highest office in the land is one of the most embarrassingly backward, un-American facts about our purportedly representative democracy. So internalized is the normalcy of white-male presidential power that we barely notice that the factors in play in 2016, from groping controversies to voter suppression, are not quirks of this years cycle but extensions of the structural obstacles to political, economic, and cultural equality that have impeded women and people of color throughout our history.\u000a\u000aIts worth noting that more than 200 women have tried, mostly in vain, to make chinks in this hardest ofglass ceilings, starting with Victoria Woodhull, a stockbroker and occultist who ran for president in 1872, nearly half a century before the passage of the 19th Amendment. A hundred years later, Shirley ?Chisholm made her historic run, which ended with negotiations over her earned delegates and a speech at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami. Chisholm compared her campaign to Catholic Al Smiths nomination in 1928, which she said paved the way for John F. Kennedys successful run in 1960. What I hope most is that now there will be others who will feel themselves as capable of running for high political office as any wealthy, good-?looking white male, she said.\u000a\u000aChisholm did not linger on the fact that 32 years separated Smiths candidacy and Kennedys election. Her own run would precede Jesse Jacksons presidential campaign and Geraldine Ferraros vice-presidential nomination by 12 years, Barack Obamas presidency and Sarah Palins vice-presidential nomination by 36 years, and Hillary Clintons nomination by 44 years.\u000a\u000aWhenClinton conceded on Wednesday morning, her most gutting line, a callback to her 2008 concession speech, was about the project being once again stalled. I know that we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, she said. But someday someone will. That someday-?someone construction left so much space and uncertainty ahead of us. At what became the dirge atthe Javits Center on Election Night, I embraced a 30-?something friend who has spent her career working to elect Democratic women to office. Throughout the election season, when things seemed particularly grim for Clinton, she would joke, Itll be easier when we elect our fourth woman president. When I hugged this friend on Tuesday night, we exchanged that line, smiling wanly. Then we were quiet. We wont live to see that. Who knows if well live to see the first.\u000a\u000aTheres a rich history of womencrying about politics. Unbought and Unbossed,a documentary about Chisholms 1972 run, ends with Chisholm saying through tears, The only thing I continue to regret of course is that we didnt have the moolah. At that same convention, Nora Ephron famously reported on Gloria Steinem, weeping on a Miami street about how George McGovern had betrayed the womens caucus. Im just tired of being screwed, and being screwed by my friends, Steinem bites out. In 1988, Colorado representative Patricia Schroeder tried to mount a presidential campaign but, like Chisholm before her, was unable to raise the money. During her speech, announcing that she would not be running, she cried, and the taunting and jeering she faced as a result of having broken down were ironed onto my 12-year-old brain. In 2008, Hillary Clinton famously got choked up the day before the New Hampshire primary, a race she was predicted to lose to Barack Obama by ten points. In one of that elections great upsets, women came out to vote for her in droves, putting her back in contention and setting up what would become her epic primary battle against Obama. Many in the media argued that women were responding to her vulnerability, her show of weakness and emotion, to some sort of Bat signal of soggy sisterhood. I thought at the time that what they were responding to was something else. Clintons show of emotion came during a week in which the media had dug her a premature grave, in which men had held up an IRON MY SHIRT sign at a rally, in which Chris Matthews had actually pinched her cheek. Tears, for women, only sometimes express sadness and vulnerability. Just as often, they signal rage.\u000a\u000aIn a way, anger is what got us even this far. Perhaps the most crucial turning point for women in politics came in 1991, when Anita Hill testified in front of an all-white, all-male Senate judiciary panel about her sexual harassment at the hands of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (who would go on to gut the Voting Rights Act, enabling the disenfranchisement of so many voters in North Carolina last week). Watching a black woman being interrogated on national television by a group of exclusively white men suddenly made Americas representational inequities glaringly obvious. Women were furious, Pat Schroeder has recalled.\u000a\u000aEllen Malcolm, who six years earlier had founded EMILYs List, a fund-raising organization built to address Chisholms moolah problem, told me that the Anita Hill hearings were when things started to really pick up for her organization. I knew everything was going to change when my phone started ringing that weekend, says Malcolm. By the following year, EMILYs List had grown to 23,000 members and raised more than $10 million. The group had a huge role in electing four Democratic women to the Senate: Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein from California, plus Carol Moseley Braun  who until last week, when Kamala Harris won in California, was the only black woman ever elected to the United States Senate  and Patty Murray, who has explicitly said that her motivation to run came from anger after watching the Hill hearings. Twenty new Democratic women were elected to Congress that year, and 1992 was dubbed the Year of the Woman. Pat Schroeder has recalled that afterward, when womens representation in the Senate was still just 7 percent and in the House was just over 10 percent, one of the Senates old bulls said to her, I really hope youre happy. This is beginning to look like a shopping mall.\u000a\u000aOf course, 1992 was also the year that Hillary Clinton first campaigned for the White House, as the (literally) better half of a political couple. Theres jokes about it, but the person who was better prepared, in terms of temperament, to be president in 1992 was Hillary, says former Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey, who ran against Bill in the Democratic primary that year. And I was running against them. He would have lost the primary if not for her  her strength of character, her presentation to the audience. People said, Okay, hes got his own problems, but she shored him up.? The irony, Kerrey continues, is that now, many of Hillarys challenges stem from the fact that shes Bill Clintons wife. The resentment that gets thrown up at Hillary  How dare you, all you are is Bill Clintons wife!  but Ill repeat it: Hes not president without her, and if you believe in God, and Hed sat down with them in the 1970s and you asked Him to pick who should run for office, Hed say, I pick her.?\u000a\u000aSpending eight years in the White House made Hillary a part of the Democratic firmament, a celebrity who rubbed elbows with the rich and powerful. Which of course helped her when she embarked on her own political career, becoming the first woman senator from the State of New York. By the time she made her first bid for the White House in 2008, she  unlike all the women who had preceded her in presidential bids  had both the money and support of the party Establishment. Her decision to go work for her former rival Barack Obama further ensconced her in the Democratic Partys highest echelons, which led to the sense of her 2016 run as inevitable, unstoppable.\u000a\u000aIt is a piteous irony that in finding a way past the specific hurdles long set before women with presidential ambitions  fund-raising and the support of a major party  Hillary Clinton also offered up to her opponents, on the left and the right, the ammunition to undercut the historic nature of her candidacy. The very fact that she had close relationships with big donors and garnered the support of major political institutions made her part of the political elite, vulnerable to the anti-?Establishment rhetoric of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. It also kept her from being understood or celebrated as the historic outsider that, as a member of a gender historically denied access to executive power, she was. In debates, when attacked as a member of the corrupt global oligarchy, Clinton would bleat about being a woman, a grandmother, different from literally everyone else ever to have been on a general-election presidential-debate stage, yet her claims never really landed. Perhaps it is a remarkable twist of fate that the outsider candidate was too much of an insider for the election she ran in, or perhaps part of todays fury at insider institutions stems from a resentment that women like Hillary Clinton can infiltrate them. Either way, in figuring out how a woman might win, she lost.\u000a\u000aIn the final stretch of her general-election campaign, Hillary Clinton did become discernible as a woman  thanks, in large part, to Donald Trump. When he dismissed her as a nasty woman, when he said that she lacked stamina, when he said she didnt look presidential, when he said that shed walked in front of him at a debate and that he wasnt impressed. When he stood menacingly behind her at the second debate, radiating his desire to punish her, spitting out his plan to imprison her should he be elected, attempting to humiliate her with women who had accused her husband of sexual misconduct. Suddenly, millions of American women remembered that no matter her wealth, or her immersion in the political ruling class, in the end, she was being treated like a woman  a woman who had dared to challenge and embarrass an angry man. A lot of women could relate.\u000a\u000aThen there was theinfamous pussy-grabbing tape. Bob Kerrey notes, with the surprise felt by many men, how that tape of Trump reminded us of the way we used to be, and let us know that its still going on! Now its more likely to be condemned, as opposed to being rewarded, because it wasnt that long ago that it was rewarded. And its the reason we havent had a woman president.\u000a\u000aWomen, many of them re-traumatized by Trumps boasting about grabbing genitals, started telling their stories about groping and sexual assault to each other and to the men in their lives. Pussy Grabs Back became a rallying cry and nasty woman was appropriated as a term of art for women who stood up for themselves.\u000a\u000aThe story of women in America is closely intertwined with the story of the countrys other structurally disadvantaged groups, even if those groups have sometimes fought with each other over a too-small piece of the pie. But in this election cycle, faced with a candidate spouting sexism and racism along with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic tirades, those groups, and their symbolic representatives, began to step up to flank Clinton. People who had reasons to distrust Hillary Clinton, especially African-?Americans who were angry about the long-term repercussions of Bill Clintons crime bill, began to get over them to try to help Clinton win a historic presidency. There was Michelle Obama, against whose husband Hillary Clinton had so bitterly fought in 2008, arriving to give clear, heart-wrenching voice to womens anger at the culture of sexual assault. There was Elizabeth Warren, in defiance of the narrative about her chilly relationship with Clinton, making the impassioned case for progressive economic reform that Clinton herself had a hard time making, in part because her husbands welfare-reform legislation had exacerbated the class divide. Clinton herself spoke more openly about her own advantages, about systemic racism, about the biases and resentments that made Michelle Obamas time as First Lady more fraught than hers.\u000a\u000aThis coalition-building was not just an illusion produced by a few high-wattage appearances. A poll released by the nonpartisan African-American Research Collaborative the Friday before Election Day found that while black voters were most motivated by jobs, 89 percent of respondents also were invested in comprehensive immigration reform, and support for same-sex marriage had risen 11 points since 2012 to 61 percent. Issues that used to divide marginalized populations  recall the passage of Prop 8 in 2008, thanks in part to a lack of support for gay rights among the African-American voters who turned out for Obama  seemed to be, slowly but righteously, becoming common cause. The prospect of a truly intersectional Democratic movement seemed possible  not just possible but key to electing the first woman president, a woman who would not only shore up the Supreme Court but who was running on promises of comprehensive immigration reform, paid family leave, subsidized child care, a higher minimum wage, the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, and criminal-justice reform, all of which would of course have trouble getting past an obstructionist Congress, but nonetheless composed a blueprint for the future, an interlocking set of fixes that might begin to address structural barriers to equality. A more integrated progressive future was a glimmer in the eye of our sitting president, his would-be successor, and the coalition of voters that appeared to be forming behind her.\u000a\u000aWhich is why that last rally in Philadelphia was so stirring. It was chilly, and clear, and the most silent political rally I had ever attended. The intensity, the held breath, the reverence for the possibility that the politicians in front of us were standing in for the increased engagement and participation of many groups of Americans who spent centuries disenfranchised but now felt they had the power to elect presidents. This was a crowd praying that the Obama presidency had not been an exception to Americas white-male rule, but instead heralded an era in which diverse participation, leadership, and representation in government was the new rule.\u000a\u000aThe heartbreaking conclusion, of course, was that the hopeful, future-?looking coalition would break down in the most depressing of ways: 53 percent of white women voters chose Donald Trump, a man who has been accused by over a dozen women of sexual assault or harassment, rather than Hillary Clinton, who not only is a woman but ran on a raft of policies that would better support women. This compared to 93 percent of black women voters and 80 percent of black men, who managed to move past their racial anxieties about Hillary Clinton to support her. Why did more than half of white women voters choose a man who ranks women on a scale of one to ten and boasts about assaulting them? It is both the most surprising thing about this election and the least. White women voters have consistently marked their ballots Republican since the 1970s: 56 percent of them voted for Romney over Obama in 2012, 53 percent for McCain over Obama in 2008, 55 percent for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004. The last time more white women voted for the Democratic candidate was actually 1996, for Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000aOne would have thought this time would be different: female candidate, openly misogynist opponent, not to mention the rise of the feminist internet and the amplification effect of social media. It wasnt. Perhaps these women felt that the advantages afforded them by their race would protect them during a Trump presidency. Perhaps they voted based on internalized misogyny, the preference for affiliation with people they still see, or want to see, as Americas most powerful and ratifying population: white men. Cut the numbers another way, and youll find that married women were more likely to vote for Trump than unmarried women by a startling margin  also perhaps due to the perceived advantages conferred by belonging to a traditional institution. Whatever their reasons, in voting for Trump, in not standing alongside the women and men who will be deported and discriminated against and whose sons and daughters will continue to be imprisoned and killed at higher rates than their sons and daughters, white women have  at least temporarily  shattered not a glass ceiling but the tenuous, hopeful coalition that had formed around Clinton and the Obamas. The possibility for being, literally, stronger together fades, and we are riven by resentments that are even deeper and more urgent than they were before.\u000a\u000aThere has been a lot of talk in this election about Hillary Clintons failure to adequately appeal to Americas working-class white men, who are suffering from the collapse of manufacturing and coal industries and plagued by a heroin epidemic. But maybe a woman trying to build a coalition of marginalized groups, and espousing policies that would help those groups, simply could never have appealed to Trumps base  even though those policies would also have helped that base. Yes, Clinton was weak on trade. Yes, she made money giving speeches to Wall Street. Yes, she was an Establishment candidate in a populist era. But Occams razor suggests that a wave of white men and women, low-income to college-educated, who came out in unanticipated numbers to vote against the female successor to a black president, and for a candidate whose supporters openly proposed imprisoning and killing both of them, were not acting wholly in response to Clintons waffling on TPP. Even suggesting that, critics are told, is exacerbating the problem: Alienating white men (and women) by noting that they responded to racism, sexism, and xenophobia is apparently more grievous a political miscalculation than giving voice to racism, sexism, and xenophobia.\u000a\u000aBut as we look forward, we must note that more than half of voters did look toward another America, a future in which participation is diverse and needs are interconnected. Hillary Clinton, the first major-party woman candidate for president of the United States, won more votes than her opponent, the man who will become only the fourth president in history to take office after winning the Electoral College and losing the popular vote. Had this happened in reverse, of course, it would be bedlam, because the will of American whiteness would have been superseded by the (rigged) system of Electoral College voting that afforded non-whites a threatening degree of power. But because this result is an affirmation of whiteness and of maleness, both in terms of the electorate and the candidate who won  there is no threat of incivility. Hillary Clinton conceded early Wednesday morning.Barack Obama welcomed Donald Trump to the White House on Thursday. Michelle showed Melania around.\u000a\u000aThis is normal  America as it has always been, not yet the better version we hoped it could be. But the half of America that lost is devastated. Crying as if someone died is a text message I received from more than one friend last week. And it is as if someone died: a dream of what we could have been, of the president we could have had. And about the loss of one of the most inspiring (and sure, flawed, but good God am I tired of having to always acknowledge that she was flawed) leaders many of us will know.\u000a\u000aWhy did more than half of white women voters choose a man who boasts about assaultingthem?\u000a\u000aThere are those who argue that this election was not a referendum on women, it was a referendum on one woman; if the Democratic candidate had been Elizabeth Warren or practically anyone else, this might not have been the outcome. Throughout the election, many people complained that Clinton was not beating Trump by 20 points. How could she not be mopping the floor with this lying, bile-spewing monstrosity? But plenty of us understood all too well that the exceedingly prepared woman often loses the job to the far-less-qualified man. And, for the record, she did lead him by 20 points or more  with African-American voters, with Latino voters, with single women voters under 55, and by close to that number with Asian-American voters; the only reason this election was even close was because of white people, mostly white men. Few seem eager to examine the possibility that certain segments of America simply do not want to be led by a woman, and that almost every other explanation for what was wrong with her  her high negatives, reputation for being untrustworthy, the email mess  originates with the ways she has been systematically demonized her whole career for being a threatening woman.\u000a\u000aThe media narrative about the wretchedness of her political skills has obscured the fact that Hillary Clinton was a pretty great candidate for the presidency. Not a magnetic or inspiring speaker, no. The bearer of way too much awkward baggage, yes. But also: steady and strong and strategic and smart. Despite being under investigation by Congress and the FBI and the media, despite having her State Department emails made public, despite having her campaign staffs emails hacked, despite being married to a man whose legislative and personal history made him deeply problematic, and despite the rolling waves of sexism directed at her and the racism directed at her predecessor and political partner Obama, she literally won the popularity contest. And the fact that she tried to build a coalition of voters that brought together the marginalized groups that will one day be the majority in this country was inspired and forward-?thinking, even in its ultimate failure.\u000a\u000aWe have gotten a clear view of how deeply this country is invested in keeping women and people of color on the sidelines. This divide does not disappear now that the election is over, and the venom spewed by our future president and his supporters during the campaign is unlikely to subside. The reproductive-rights activist Alison Turkos has written of how, on the night of the third debate, she was walking in Manhattan in a Clinton-Kaine T-shirt when a man grabbed her and whispered in her ear, Hillary Clintons a fucking cunt and so are you. Swastikas, alongside SIEG HEIL graffiti, were spray-painted on a building in South Philadelphia on Election Night. Two Babson College students drove a truck waving a Trump flag through the campus of Hillary Clintons alma mater, Wellesley College, taking care to drive past Harambee House, the schools African-American center, on Wednesday morning. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders booed Hillary Clinton as she was giving her concession speech, shouting Lock her up!\u000a\u000aWe are in a period of tremendous national turmoil. What we are seeing is a backlash not just against Clintons candidacy but against the entire eight years of the Obama administration. Its not just about who gets to be president. Its about who gets to vote for the president, who gets to stay in America and make their families here and how those families get to be configured. Its about who controls the culture, who makes the art, who makes the policies, whom those policies benefit and whom they harm.\u000a\u000aAs Clinton pointed out that Sunday at the Mt. Airy Church of God in Christ, the spaces between advances in our society are often long ones: Nearly 100 years passed between African-Americans being guaranteed the right to vote by the 15th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Of all the women who attended the convention at Seneca Falls in 1848, only one of them lived to see women get the vote in 1920. A few of those women who recall the passage of the 19th Amendment, and many more black women who had to fight for their franchise in the Jim Crow South, got to vote for a woman for president on Tuesday. They wont live to see a woman inaugurated. But  someday, someone.\u000a\u000a*This article appears in the November 14, 2016, issue ofNew York Magazine.

V(Source: Allegheny County Police)\u000aBRENTWOOD (KDKA)  A Brentwood man is in jail after police say he beat his roommate to death during an argument over beer.\u000aAllegheny County Police say they are charging the suspect, identified as Justin Vankirk, in connection with the death of his roommate, Charles Parker, on Monday.\u000aAccording to the criminal complaint, Vankirk called police to report his roommate had died on Tuesday.\u000aOfficials pronounced Parker dead at the scene, and investigators say Vankirk gave various accounts of how he found the victim, and a timeline of events had varied as well.\u000aPolice took Vankirk into custody. He was first taken to the Brentwood Police Station and later transported to Allegheny County Police headquarters for further questioning.\u000aWhen police questioned him, the criminal complaint reports that Vankirk admitted that he got into a confrontation with the victim.\u000aAccording to the criminal complaint, Vankirk said Parker stole some beer he had bought. During the confrontation, the suspect told police he struck his roommate several times on the face and head.\u000aParker suffered bruising, swelling and he was bleeding from his lips and mouth.\u000aThe suspect said he then dragged the victim from the bedroom/living room area to the dining area, because he did not want any blood to get on his carpet and then went to bed, the criminal complaint reported.\u000aWhen examining the victim, investigators reported abnormalities about the back of his head.\u000aAccording to the criminal complaint, Vankirk called police the next afternoon after getting home.\u000aInvestigators also searched Vankirks cell phone, saying they found a photo of the victim lying on the dining room floor. They also said his knuckles were swollen and he had blood on one of his shoes.\u000aThe Allegheny County Medical Examiners Office performed an autopsy on the victim.\u000aAllegheny County and Brentwood Police continue the investigation.

VWhile two-headed sharks may seem to belong to the silver screen in some sci-fi movie like Sharknado, they in fact do exist in the real world. More and more of these strange creatures are turning up all around the world.\u000aDon't Miss: Amazon's Best Deal on Amazon Echo\u000aA couple of years ago, scientists opened the uterus of a bull shark which contained a two-headed fetus. Eight years ago, another man discovered a blue shark embryo which was two-headed too.\u000aAs for a 2011 study, it found conjoined blue shark twins that had been caught off the Gulf of California. Blue sharks have proven to produce the most two-headed embryos since they give birth to large litters.\u000aSometimes these litters consist of 50 or more blue shark embryos. Meanwhile, a catshark embryo was seen which resembled the two-headed blue shark embryo.\u000aHowever, it had been found in an egg-laying species of shark, accoridng to National Geographic. A question that automatically comes up is what is causing these two-headed shark embryos in such record numbers.\u000aIt may most likely be a genetic fault. Since the catsharks embryos were raised in the lab, there were obviously mutations which took place along the way due to the artificial conditions.\u000aWhile the lab technicians ensured that no chemical exposure or radiation or infectious virus came within a few feet of the shark embryos, yet the mutations nevertheless took place.\u000aThis shows us what a delicate piece of work Nature is and how human intervention only causes harm. Everything is finetuned and when human beings interfere, there is havoc.\u000aThe malformations of sharks in the wild are due to different reasons though. Everything from viral agents to metabolic defects and pollutants may be to blame.\u000aAlso a lessening gene pool due to overfishing may be responsible for inbreeding. This leads to genetic anomalies. Two-headed sharks remain a subject that has fascinated scientists and it will continue to remain a mind-boggling natural fact for researchers.\u000aOverfishing is the most likely cause behind this abnormality of sorts. Other weird things such as a one-eyed cyclops shark have also turned up. The fisheries will have to cut down on their activities since overfishing will lead to diseases in the species of marine wildlife.

V(Daily Caller) C Leaked transcripts from a closed-door fundraiser reveal former president Bill Clinton privately agreeing with one of Republican nominee Donald Trumps major campaign themes: the political system is rigged against working class Americans.\u000aClinton also appeared to tell the audience of Democratic donors that Hillary Clinton deserves to be elected president.\u000aClintons comments took place at an October 2015 private fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Cheseapeake, Maryland.\u000aThe transcript of Clintons remarks were published by WikiLeaks alongside thousands of emails sent and received by Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.\u000aIn the speech, Clinton admitted that there are lots of people in the Democratic Party and lots of working people all over the world who are sick and tired of working their heart out and never getting a pay raise.\u000aClinton then conceded that, to some extent, the political system is rigged against the working class.\u000aAnd so they think the political system is rigged against them, which it is to some extent, and they think it doesnt make any difference anyway, so they want to vote for whoever they think will raise the most hell, he said.\u000aI want to vote for whoever I think will make the most difference, and thats what you have to talk to people about. If the issue is who will make the most difference, its not a close question.\u000a20151019 WJC Remarks at HFA Fundraiser in Chesapeake Beach, MD by Peter Hasson on Scribd\u000aBefore admitting that the system is rigged, Bill appeared to say that Hillary Clinton deserves the White House and that voters shouldnt disappoint her by voting for somebody else.\u000aWhether in office or out of office, she has consistently gotten the job done in an honorable way, the transcript reads.

VDonald Trump has named Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, as his White House chief of staff, NBC News has learned. \u000a Trump's transition team confirmed the appointment. \u000a The Republican, who is serving his third term with the RNC, was reported to be at the top of Trump's shortlist for the key White House position. That list also reportedly included Steve Bannon, Trump's controversial campaign CEO whose website, Breitbart News, has espoused anti-Semitic and nationalist views. \u000a Instead, Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president, Trump's transition team announced Sunday. \u000a The choice of Priebus is certain to comfort establishment Republicans wary that the unpredictable candidate Trump will make a reappearance in the White House  but one that could fuel resentment among the grassroots. \u000aRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus speaks during the final day of the 2016 Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 21, 2016. MICHAEL REYNOLDS / EPA\u000a Priebus earned respect from Republicans over the course of his six-year tenure as head of the RNC, proving to be a powerful fundraising force who deftly navigated the party through the internal squabbling sparked by the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement following the 2010 election. \u000a Priebus, once Wisconsin's GOP Chairman, has close ties House Speaker Paul Ryan, also a Wisconsin Republican, and could serve as a liason to Capitol Hill who's trusted by both sides. \u000a But the move is likely to fuel concerns among grassroots conservatives who believe Priebus moved too aggressively to consolidate power among the GOP establishment during his tenure as RNC chairman. In fact, former Trump adviser Roger Stone tweeted this weekend the pick "would cause a rebellion in Trump's base." \u000aThe selection of @reince for COS in a @realDonaldTrump WH would cause a rebellion in Trump's base. #RyansBoy\u000a Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) November 12, 2016 \u000a Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund co-founder Jenny Beth Martin also warned in a statement that naming Priebus, a "Washington insider," as chief of staff "would make it more difficult, not less, for President Trump to achieve the change the people voted for." \u000a The pick of Priebus marks a remarkable turnaround in their once-fraught relationship that reflects Priebus' careful and persistent efforts to gain Trump's respect and confidence over the course of the general election campaign. \u000a During the primary fight, Trump railed against Priebus and the GOP for party rules concerning selection of the nominee that Trump insisted were unfair. \u000a "It's a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself," Trump said of the rules in April. \u000a At the time, Priebus tweeted in response: "Nomination process known for a year + beyond. It's the responsibility of the campaigns to understand it. Complaints now? Give us all a break." \u000a But since Trump won his party's nomination, Priebus became one of the candidate's closest advisers and was seen as one of the forces that helped reign Trump in and keep him on-message  one of the small group of advisers dubbed the "Trump Whisperers." \u000a The pick opens up the RNC chairmanship, but Trump is expected to have significant influence over who is eventually chosen by RNC membership as chair. \u000a Senior Trump adviser Dave Bossie, who was recently elected Republican National Committeeman from Maryland, is seen as a potential pick, and is said to be privately jockeying for the chairmanship.

VEvery time I tighten or redrive the mounting screws on our handrail, it always comes loose again. What am I doing wrong?CLAUDE Y., HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA\u000aOnce a part works loose, creating an airspace between it and its mounting surface, the looseness acts as a force multiplier. You tighten it and it loosens even more. The cycle repeats until the part comes completely undone or breaks. The moral? Tighten something as soon as it comes loose, otherwise it will only get worse. When tightening, check if the threads are stripped, if anything was over- or undertightened, or if the wrong size or type of fastener was used. There's almost always a good reason that tight things become loose.\u000aThe first thing to do in your repair is ensure that the mounting screws for the brackets are hitting solid lumber. Make a test run with a 1/16-inch drill bit to confirm that the screws aren't just catching the edge of the stud. Next, try using a longer screw of the same diameter so it fits through the existing mounting hole but reaches a fresh part of the stud. You may be tempted to try to fix the stripped-out hole by inserting a piece of copper wire or a glue-covered golf tee, but this is not the place to do it. You need to reach solid lumber. If that doesn't work, you'll need a thicker and larger mounting bracket. You might even sneak in one structural screw (a hybrid fastener, somewhere between a lag screw and a wood screw) at each bracket location. Even if you have to slightly drill out the screw-mounting hole to accept the structural screw, it'd be worth it to fix this problem for good.

VHillary Clinton took the stage at the Plumbers \u005cu0026 Pipefitters Training Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday to encourage Nevada to take advantage of in-person early voting, which ends on Friday. The Democratic nominee criticized Trump on a variety of issues, but blasted the real estate mogul for not saying hed accept the elections results when asked at the third presidential debate. "That has never happened in American history before, she said. Donald Trump has shown us the kind of person he is and the kind of president he would be.

Clinton said this election "may be the most important of our lifetimes." Throughout various campaign appearances this week, Clinton has told her supporters to "stage an intervention" with friends who are voting for Trump. You have six days to convince everybody you can talk to to get out and vote, Clinton said during her Las Vegas stop.

"Someone who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults Latinos and African Americans," Clinton said. "What would it be like to have that person in the most powerful office in the world?" Clinton then accused Trump of pitting people against each other.

VThe most surprising team of the 2016 NFL season looks to continue to prove the doubters wrong in Week 10. The Dallas Cowboys visit the Pittsburgh Steelers as underdogs on Sunday, despite being tied for the leagues best record.\u000aAfter winning seven of their first eight games, including a 25-point victory over the Cleveland Browns in Week 9, Dallas is a 2.5-point underdog for their visit to Pittsburgh. The Steelers have lost three games in a row, including a 21-14 defeat to the Baltimore Ravens last week.\u000aPittsburghs losing streak has coincided with the injury to Ben Roethlisberger. The quarterback battled through a torn meniscus against the Miami Dolphins in a Week 6 defeat. The Steelers lost their next game with Landry Jones under center, and Pittsburgh lost at Baltimore when the quarterback returned well ahead of schedule.\u000aRoethlisberger has played poorly through the injury, throwing two touchdowns and three interceptions for a passer rating well below 70.0. The question remains whether or not he can have a bounce-back performance against Dallas.\u000aBetween the injury and the Cowboys defense, it might be difficult for Roethlisberger to put up big numbers. No quarterback has been particularly successful against Dallas this season, and as a result, the Cowboys have held every opponent to 23 points or fewer.\u000aQuarterback Dak Prescott congratulates guard Ronald Leary and wide receiver Cole Beasley on a touchdown against the Cleveland Browns at FirstEnergy Stadium Cleveland, Ohio, on Nov. 6, 2016.\u000aOffensively, Dallas is led by two rookies that continue to impress each and every week. Dak Prescott is coming off his best game of the season, and while his 141.8 passer rating came against the winless Browns, the first-year quarterback has posted a passer rating of at least 103.7 in six of the teams eight games. In their two contests against top-10 rated passers, the Steelers have surrendered 588 passing yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.\u000aEzekiel Elliott makes it difficult for opposing teams to mount any kind of comeback when the Cowboys take the lead. The rookie has run for at least 90 yards in each of his last six contests. Pittsburgh allowed 204 rushing yards to Jay Ajayi and 127 rushing yards to LeGarrette Blount in their Week 6 and Week 7 losses, respectively.\u000aWith wide receiver Antonio Brown and running back LeVeon Bell, Pittsburgh has some of the NFLs best offensive weapons. Theyll look to take advantage of injuries to Dallas' secondary, which will be without safety Barry Church and cornerback Morris Claiborne, and the final score could approach the over/under of 50.\u000aBut the Cowboys have successfully faced every challenge thats come their way, and they have a good chance to do so against a Steelers team that is struggling to move the ball.\u000aPrediction: Dallas over Pittsburgh, 24-21

VA woman smokes an e-cigarette. Health experts say they are safer than conventional cigarettes and may help some people stop smoking, but questions remain.\u000aA year ago, Ryan Standifird, 26, of Tustin, Calif., was a pack-a-day smoker who wanted to quit. He had tried and failed before.\u000aThen, as part of a magazine writing assignment, he tried e-cigarettes. The battery-powered devices heat up flavored liquids, creating vapors that users inhale. Most contain nicotine, the chemical that makes regular cigarettes so addictive. With free supplies from a friends vape shop, Standifird says he easily made the switch. Aside from one two-month slide back to smoking, hes been a vaper (an e-cigarette user) ever since.\u000aIts the closest thing Ive found to replicating smoking a cigarette. The amount of vapor is pretty much the same  the feel of it in my hand, the tobacco flavor, the nicotine hit, Standifird says. Theres also the social aspect. I still have friends who smoke, and its nice to be able to go out with them and puff on my e-cigarette.\u000aSo is Standifirds experience a quitting success story  or a cautionary tale about trading one unhealthy addiction for another?\u000aThe answer is complicated, and a source of heated debate.\u000aWhat we have going on right now is a natural experiment, says Thomas Glynn, a former official at the American Cancer Society, now a consulting professor at Stanford Universitys school of medicine.\u000aE-cigarettes and similar devices come in a variety of styles including those that look like cigarettes or pens and others that look like pipes. The FDA calls all of them electronic nicotine delivery systems.\u000aUnknown numbers of U.S. smokers are trying e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. No major medical group in the United States recommends the practice, but that could change.\u000aHere are some of the questions fueling the debate.\u000aDo e-cigarettes really help people quit?\u000aWe have no definitive data, Glynn says. But, he says, preliminary trials suggest they are probably about as good, as other nicotine replacement products, such as gums and patches.\u000aStanton Glantz\u000aThose studies were done with older e-cigarettes that delivered nicotine less effectively, says Christopher Bullen, a researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Newer products may work better, he says.\u000aE-cigarettes will never be a silver bullet, he says, but could be a lifeline for many people who have struggled to stop smoking before and failed time and again.\u000aBut Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, sees existing research differently. He is convinced, he says, that for most people, (e-cigarettes) inhibit quitting, creating dual users who vape and smoke.\u000aGlantz says quitters should stick to proven methods, including counseling and medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\u000aThose are the best choices right now and they are underused, says Edward Anselm, a New York City physician who advises insurance companies and is a senior fellow at the non-profit R Street Institute. But, Anselm says, doctors should cheer on any smoker eager to quit with e-cigarettes. Theyre motivated, they are ready and they have a plan, he says.\u000aCliff Douglas, vice president of tobacco control at the American Cancer Society\u000aHow safe or unsafe are they?\u000aIn a recent survey, 35% of adult smokers said e-cigarettes were at least as harmful as conventional cigarettes, up from 12% in 2012.\u000aThats just wrong, says Cliff Douglas, vice president of tobacco control at the cancer society. They dont pose equal risk. Conventional combustible tobacco products are far more harmful.\u000aThe Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom estimates that conventional cigarettes are 95% more dangerous than e-cigarettes.\u000aTheres no data to support that, or any exact risk comparison, Douglas says. Still, he says, the cancer society is working on updated messaging to help the public better understand the available science.\u000aAn e-cigarette produces some toxins, he says, but nothing like the 7,000 chemicals, including 70 human carcinogens, produced by a lit tobacco cigarette.\u000aWhat about nicotine? The nicotine in e-cigarettes is addictive and can raise blood pressure, but nicotine is not a carcinogen, Glynn says.\u000aThe burned cigarette is public enemy No. 1, he says. Thats what is killing half a million Americans and 6 million people around the globe each year.\u000aEven Glantz, among the fiercest critics of e-cigarettes, says they are no doubt less toxic than conventional cigarettes. If somebody switches entirely and is just using an e-cigarette, you are better off, but probably not as better off as you like to think.\u000aThe FDA has just started regulating e-cigarettes. It says the devices have both potential benefits and risks and has banned their sale to minors.\u000aWhat could go wrong in real-world use?\u000aAmong fears: e-cigarettes could renormalize smoking, create a pathway to smoking for young people and robbing current smokers of a reason to quit by letting them vape where smoking is forbidden. Those are among the reasons many health advocates want e-cigarettes banned everywhere smoking is banned.\u000aAnother fear: Vapers who cut down but do not quit smoking may have an exaggerated view of the health payoff. Even a few cigarettes a day pose important health risks, Douglas says.\u000aFinally, no one knows the long-term risks for ex-smokers such as Standifird who go on to vape for months or years. Ideally, they would wean themselves off their new habit as quickly as possible, Glynn says.\u000aI know I should quit, Standifird says, because of the health risks and the costs (about $6 a day for his refill cartridges). But I enjoy it. I enjoyed smoking and I enjoy vaping.

VSaturday Night Live poked fun at Democrats who were overly confident on election night, with the help of surprise guest Chris Rock.\u000aIn the skit, a group of friends made excuses about why the results werent going their candidate Hillary Clintons way. It was up to characters played by comedians Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock to be the voice of reason.\u000aYep, it might be an historic night, but dont forget its a big country, said Chappelles character, after one pal stated at the beginning of the evening how she couldnt believe America was about to have its first woman president.\u000aAfter Alaska was called for Donald Trump, another friend said she now thought America was racist. But it evidently came as no surprise to Chappelles character. Oh my God, he said. I remember my great-grandfather told me something like that. He was like a slave or something, I dont know.\u000aWhen another friend asked why people werent turning out for Clinton in the same way that they did for President Barack Obama, Rock quipped that it may have something to do with replacing a charismatic 40-year-old black guy with a 70-year-old white woman.

VAs Kim Kardashian-West just turned 36th on October 21st, I wanted to take a moment and celebrate this big booty beauty. Although the reality TV star is no stranger to hate, even from fellow celeberties, she defeintely is not given as much credit as she deserves. Here are 10 reasons why I think Kim K is a good role model for women.\u000a1. Yes, I dont live under a rock and I know Mrs. Kardashian-West has a sex tape. But what matters most is how after hitting rock bottom, she moved forward. We all make mistakes, and Kim shows us that we have to own our mistakes and what doesnt kill us makes us stronger.\u000a2. She represents interracial marriage and family structure.\u000a3. She shows young girls that you dont have to be 510 and 100 pounds to be beautiful. Kim embraces her curves and wears them well.\u000a4. She is a businesswoman and a mom, proving to women that we really can have the best of both worlds. Check out all of her business in this Forbes article.\u000a5. She is a MILF. Kim proves that women dont have to shiveral up and let themselves go once they become moms, but can still be hot and confident.\u000a6. She loves and supports her family. Kim is always there for her sisters whenever they need her and honors her mother.\u000aAt the end of the day, life is about being happy being who you are, and I feel like we are so blessed to have the support system and the best family to really just support each other no matter what we're going through.~ Kim Kardashian-West\u000a7. She is a fashion icon. Kim expresses herself creatively through the way she dresses, showing young girls that it is cool to have your own style.\u000a8. She stands up for herself. When Chloe Grace Moretz threw shade at her for posting a naked Instagram picture she tweeted, "Let's all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is. your nylon cover is cute boo." Good for you Kim!\u000a9. She always supported Caitlyn Jenner through her transition.\u000a*All images are from Kim Kardashian's Instagram

VTAMPA, FL - NOVEMBER 13: Mike Evans\u000aSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the trend of players kneeling during the national anthem this preseason, as a call for change in the United States. Most of the attention on those who choose to kneel or sit during the anthem has gone away, but Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans did it before Sundays game for a new reason.\u000aWhen he was asked in the post-game locker room why he did not rise for the national anthem, heres some of what Evans had to say (via Joe Bucs Fan.com).\u000aI dont want to, you know, disrespect the veterans or anything, Evans said. The men and women who serve this country, Im forever indebted to them. But the things thats been going on in America lately, Im not going to stand for that. When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says weve been punked, then Ill stand again. But I wont stand anymore.\u000aIf this happens, then Americas not right right now, Evans said. I said this a long time ago. When [Donald Trump] ran, I thought it was a joke, and the joke continues.\u000aIm not a political person that much, but I got common sense. And I know when somethings not right.\u000aEvans added he will continue to kneel for the national anthem for as long as he (Trump) is the president-elect. I suppose that leaves Evans an opening to start standing for the national anthem again once Trump is sworn in as president, so its likely he at least continues to kneel for the rest of this season.\u000aEvans was mostly invisible during Sundays game, with four catches for 66 yards, and if not for a 39-yard catch after Jameis Winston seemed to avoid the entire Chicago Bears front-seven Evans would have contributed even less to Tampa Bays decisive 36-10 win. But no one will be talking about much of anything on the field related to the Buccaneers on Sunday night, as Evans protest has now become the talking point.

V"This was a white-lash against a changing country, Van Jones said. | Getty\u000a\u000aCNN commentator Van Jones said racial tensions, including the race of the current president, caused a white-lash that helped drive Donald Trumps Rust Belt victories.\u000a\u000aFactors other than race existed too, acknowledged Jones, a former aide to Obama's White House. But a backlash by white voters was also at play, he said early Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"This was a white-lash against a changing country, he said. "It was a white-lash against a black president in part, and that's the part where the pain comes. And Donald Trump has a responsibility tonight to come out and reassure people that he is going to be the president of all the people who he insulted and offended and brushed aside."

VJessica and Keith couldnt believe the news that they were having identical twin girls. After staring at the ultrasound screen for a few moments, Keith nearly fainted right there in the doctors office. \u000aBut the couple from Ouray, Colorado were in for another much scarier surprise. Tatiana and Trinity are rare mono mono twins, which occur once in every 10,000 pregnancies. Now, people across the country are following their pregnancy journey and praying for a safe and successful delivery. \u000aKJCT reports: Typically with twins, an egg splits into two unique embryos. With mono mono twins, the egg splits late. This means the babies each have their own umbilical cord, but share the same placenta and are in the same amniotic sac. \u000aSince the babies share one amniotic sac, there is a much greater risk of the two cords getting tangled. And in the video below, you can see the umbilical cord right in front of one babys face while she sleeps. \u000aBecause of the tricky placement of the umbilical cords, Tatiana and Trinity require even more consistent monitoring. Jessica has been on bedrest at the hospital for two straight months. \u000aDoctors say mono mono twins carry a 20 percent risk of mortality. \u000aBut despite these dangers, Jessica and Keith consider their baby girls a blessing. \u000aThey cant wait to continue along the journey toward parenthood. \u000aPlease SHARE these incredible twins with your friends on Facebook, and lets send some well wishes for this family.

VIf youve ever supped up a Coca-Cola from a McDonalds machine, you may have wondered why it tastes better than Coca-Cola from other restaurants.\u000aSome say the drink is more palatable because they put more syrup into the mixture, while others think that as McDonalds food is so salty, it makes you thirsty C which makes the soda taste better.\u000aIts not your imagination C Coca-Cola apparently does taste better in McDonalds restaurants\u000aHowever this is not the case, with McDonalds answering the long debated question on its website.\u000aThe site states that it follows the guidelines set by Coca-Cola and takes steps to ensure it tastes the same as when you buy it in a bottle.\u000aThe larger McDonalds straws allow more drink to hit the taste buds\u000aAt other restaurants, Coca-Cola syrup is delivered in plastic bags C but for McDonalds, Coca-Cola delivers its syrup in stainless steel tanks that ensure its freshness.\u000aAlso, McDonalds sells a very high volume of soda, which means the syrup doesnt sit around for very long.\u000aThe fast food giant also ensures its syrups and drink fountain is ice cold. Insulated tubing is run from the back refrigeration unit all the way to the front and drive-through units.\u000aThe soda water is constantly recirculated through this tubing system so that it can remain between 33-38 degrees (just above freezing) at all times.\u000aKeeping this water chilled is necessary to maintain superior CO2 levels, which means that it can become more carbonated. Better soda water ultimately makes for a crisper fizzy drink.\u000aMcDonalds said on its website: The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled before entering our fountain dispensers with the radio of syrup set up to allow for ice to melt.\u000aWe also keep our fountain beverage system cold so you r drunk can always be at the peak of refreshing.\u000aMcDonalds Coke is ice-cold which keeps the liquid bubbly\u000aMcDonalds invests a fair amount of money to ensure that each of its restaurants has a high-end water filtration system.\u000aIt said: In order to ensure our drinks are always meeting a gold standard, we have proper filtration methods in place.\u000aIts not just the technical machines C something as simple as the size of the straw makes all the difference too.\u000aMcDonalds revealed: Theres also our straw C its slightly wider than a typical straw, so all that Coke taste can hit all your taste buds.

VBiloxi resident Martha Broussard shares her story of what happened on Nov. 10 when her sons dog, Cleo, attacked her 15-year-old neighbor Jaxon Ronsonet. I love children. I dont want to see anything like this happen, said Broussard. Ronsonets injuries were so serious that he was airlifted to New Orleans. Amanda McCoy\u000a Nobody knows what provoked Cleo. \u000aBut the aftermath is hell for two families on Shady Lane  for the one whose children were seriously injured when the 3-year-old pit bull and terrier mix attacked and for the family next door that owns Cleo.\u000aJaxon Ronsonet, 15, might lose his left leg, while his little brother, Bentley Fontan, 5, has more stitches than his aunt can count and now finds ordinary objects menacing.\u000aThe woman who was keeping Cleo, 54-year-old Martha Broussard, is a nervous wreck. As a mother and grandmother, she feels awful about what happened to the boys and said she will never get images of the attack out of her head.\u000aAll the while, Facebook commenters are rushing to judgment and making menacing comments toward Broussard and her sons.\u000aSaving baby brother \u000aThursday was unfolding like any ordinary day until Broussard got home with her groceries, set them down and released Cleo from a kennel, she said. She said she had told the boys, who were playing in the side yard, she was about to let Cleo out.\u000aThey knew Cleo, as did her own grandchildren. She was keeping the dog for one of her sons and he spent most of the time in a kennel in her dining room.\u000aShe said she threw a stick for the dog, then a second. The boys, she said, came around front toward Cleo. Broussard said she warned them to get back.\u000aCleo, she said, bit Bentley in the behind. His big brother hefted Bentley over a trash can by the driveway, trying to protect him, and started kicking at Cleo. Cleo latched onto Jaxons leg.\u000aBroussard grabbed a rake that was leaning against the house and began jabbing Cleo. But Cleo would not let go of Jaxon. Next, Broussard, said, she tried the metal end of a shovel, pounding Cleo over and over. Still, the dog would not let up.\u000aThe boys aunt, Tiffany Fontan, ran from her home next door when she heard the commotion. She said she threw herself on top of Bentley to protect him, then rushed him inside as the attack on Jaxon escalated.\u000aFontan says a neighbor finally broke up the attack with a shovel, while Broussard says she brought out food that got Cleos attention. Broussard was able to get Cleo back into the house and into her cage. Broussard estimates the attack lasted about 15 minutes.\u000aAfterward, animal control officers took Cleo to the Humane Society of South Mississippi. Her fate is uncertain, but Broussard feels sure the dog will be euthanized.\u000aIts just unbelievable, said Broussard, still visibly shaken Sunday. Yall just dont know how bad I feel. Nobodys going to be able to wipe the memory out of my head.\u000aThe aftermath \u000aJaxons legs were mangled. Broussard said he asked at one point after the attack, Am I going to be able to walk?\u000aTiffany Fontan and Bentley were driving to Ochsner on Sunday to check on Jaxon. Bentley cant walk. He has stitches in his behind. The top of his right foot is split from his big toe to his ankle. His aunt has been trying to do arts and crafts with him.\u000aShe cut out a snow flake and was opening it when Bentley looked at the tips of the flake and said, Those look like sharp, sharp teeth.\u000aJaxon is heavily sedated. His mother, Tiffany Ronsonet, is updating his condition on the GoFundMe page set up to help the family with expenses. He is scheduled to have a third surgery Monday, his aunt said, to clean and flush his wounds and remove more dying tissue. The family does not know if he will be able to keep his left leg.\u000aHe reacted so quick, Fontan said. If that dog had done Bentley like it did Jaxon, this baby would not be here today. Jaxon is a hero in our eyes. He may lose his leg. He will not lose it in war, but he will lose it having saved his baby brother's life.\u000aI've got just as much respect for him as I do someone serving our country. This kid is amazing.

VTaylor Swift has definitely sexed up her look lately. There was that time she actually showed her belly button, a few crop tops at award shows, and then a skintight catsuit. But her look from the 2016 CMA Awards might be her sexiest yet.\u000aAfter going three years without appearing at the CMAs, Taylor took the stage at the awards show in Nashville, Tennessee, to present the biggest honor of the night: Entertainer of the Year. But while here mere presence was surprising, the biggest shocker was her provocative Julien MacDonald dress, which featured alluring cutouts that showed off her abs and obliques, a strappy backless situation, and a sky-high center slit. Oh, also the dress was mostly sheer (gasp!). \u000aThats a lot of skin for T-Swift! She doesnt usually reach for the naked dresses. But when youre presenting the biggest award of the night, you dress to impress. \u000aHi, Nashville, she began. "Its been almost 13 years since I came [here] with a dream to be a songwriter and recording artist and I learned so much about what it means to be an entertainer from the remarkable artists in this arena tonightThats one of the reasons I feel so honored to present this award to any one of these five outstanding nominees for Entertainer of the year and be a part of this historic night we will always remember.\u000aUltimately, the CMA Award went to Garth Brooks, who happily walked on stage and hugged Taylor.\u000aWelcome back, Tay!

VFormer New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani on Sunday claimed that the wave of protests against President-elect Donald Trump are exaggerating the fears of his presidency, despite an increase in acts of racism and bigotry since the election Tuesday.\u000aI feel very bad about that, Giuliani said on ABCs This Week, addressing the protests. But if those were Donald Trump people doing that after a Hillary Clinton election, I think a lot of people be D a lot of that D there would be a lot more anger in the media at the fact that theyre protesting a legitimately decided election.\u000aGiuliani suggested that the protesters fears are unfounded D even though Trump has pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. and deport all undocumented immigrants, as well as put forth rhetoric espousing hate and division. \u000aI think we understand their frustration. We certainly dont want to make it worse. I think theyre exaggerating the fears of a Donald Trump presidency because theyre coming off a campaign where theyre very disappointed, Giuliani said. Im sure our supporters would have been very disappointed had Donald Trump not won. And I just hope it calms down.\u000aProtesters in dozens of U.S. cities have taken to the streets since Tuesdays election to protest Trump. Meanwhile, there have been numerous reports of incidents of racism and bigotry over the last week, which Trump has yet to denounce.\u000aInstead, he posted several tweets over the weekend criticizing the media and the professional protesters, calling the situation very unfair!\u000aAn anti-Trump protest in Los Angeles on Saturday.\u000aThe Southern Poverty Law Center and the Council on American Islamic Relations, two organizations that track hate crimes, have both reported an increase in such incidents and suggested that the level of hate crimes may have surpassed that of the period immediately following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\u000aBut when ABCs George Stephanopoulos asked Giuliani on Sunday if Trump would denounce the hate crimes, the former New York mayor wouldnt answer and continued to discuss the protests, claiming, like Trump, that they were led by professional protesters.\u000aGiuliani, whose name has been mentioned as a possible candidate for attorney general under Trump, noted his history of cracking down on crime and said he has zero tolerance for riots. He also suggested that President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should denounce the protests.\u000aI know both Secretary Clinton and President Obama were very gracious and I respect that a lot in the way they handled it the day after, two days after. But I wish they would say something about it too, he said. Because after all, these are supporters of President Obama and Hillary Clinton and maybe they could say something about this. Really, not the right thing in the democracy.

This turned out to be some kind of a diplomat from Trinidad so he told me. He said he would need $1,480 so I marked that down. He said it was an attorney that was highly recommended to get him out of this case. \u000aPongonis grandson made him promise not to tell his mother, Diane, because he didnt want to get in trouble. \u000aPongonis filled out a MoneyGram for $1,480 to send to the attorney and took it to a nearby Marcs grocery store. \u000aAfter he dropped the money order off, he got a call from a cashier at Marcs. The cashier immediately could tell that Pongonis was being scammed. The call wasnt from his grandson, it was from a con artist. The cashier called him to let him know, then returned his money. \u000aShe says, Im the one that stopped this from going through with the MoneyGram company, Pongonis said. \u000aShockingly, the scammer called again to ask for more money. This time Pongonis contacted Diane, who told him that his grandson was just fine.\u000aIf it werent for this thoughtful cashier, Pongonis would have been out of $1,400!\u000aPlease SHARE this story to applaud this worker and let others know to be wary about grandchildren who call asking for money!

VPresident Obama mocked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for reportedly losing access to his own Twitter account in the run-up to the election, during a speech for Hillary Clinton in Michigan on Monday.\u000aOver the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account, Obama said. Now, if your closets advisers dont trust you to tweet then how can we trust him with the nuclear codes?\u000aThe New York Times reported on Sunday that aides to the Republican presidential nominee had finally wrested away the Twitter account had been his primary venue for getting out an unfiltered political messageand attacking opponents. During the campaign, Trump has used Twitter to 0ly accuse a former Miss Universe of having recorded a sex tape, to share an unflattering image of Sen. Ted Cruzs wife, and to berate countless foes.\u000aObama appeared on behalf of Clinton at the University of Michigan on Monday, and he will make another stop in New Hampshire before closing out the evening at a rally in Philadelphia, while Clinton, Bill Clinton and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be in attendance.

VThroughout my life, my family and peers brushed aside my retaliations to their sexist comments, branding me as just condescending or ill-tempered.\u000aBecause sexist tenets are the norm, any sort of deviation in my family or in my high school was labeled as lacking significance or as a temper tantrum. Sexist comments were seen as harmless projections of the absolute, with no implications of psychological or physical harm. The mere suggestion of sexism in response to these comments would be seen as a non sequitur.\u000aThe misogynists that weaseled their way into my life will argue that the oppression of women is obviously a myth made up by women with a bad case of penis envy. Or that women themselves want to be paid 80 cents to the dollars, because theres nothing more comforting than having a man dominate their finances.\u000aIgnorant kids in my high school English class insist that women should feel honored when men reach under a womans skirt and snap a pic, and neither the act nor that comment is sexist and oppressive, if sexism even exists at all. And the girl who cried in our class when our football player made the comment about up-skirting? She was probably just hormonal because of her period.\u000aSexism, however, doesnt just exist in comments and private photographs. It can have more detrimental implications, as if the comments themselves arent already harmful enough.\u000aIn senior year of high school, a guy nonconsensually grinded his dick on me the first time I got white-girl wasted. The next day, I sought support from a friend who was going to Princeton, stupidly correlating how woke someone is to their SAT score.\u000aTo my dismay, he dismissed the sexual assault as the guy merely being a jerk. Instead of consoling me and encouraging me to confront my assailant, he commented, Can you blame him? as if I should feel flattered that my exposed midriff was enough to make the dude hard. As if I deserved it.\u000aDespite Mr. Princetons ability to studiously attend to a three-hour test and fly by in high school with stellar grades, his education clearly did nothing to rid him of his internalized misogyny, and he ignorantly continued to perpetuate rape culture.\u000aRape culture and disrespect for women, already deeply embedded in our society, are now further normalized with a president who brags about sexually assaulting women. He himself, along with half the country, excuses his comments as harmless locker room talk. But in reality, his attitude and comments toward women, minorities and the LGBTQ+ community embolden some to discriminate and commit hate crimes.\u000aThe chauvinists in the country will no longer feel obliged to internalize their beliefs when the most powerful man in the world celebrates their bigotry as hegemonic truth. Trumps victory in the election despite discriminatory comment coming out of his thin, pursed lips every other day, suggests that United States is the white mans world.\u000aThe United States will not hold a white man, especially one that is rich and powerful, accountable for groping women. Nasty women will not be served justice in the next four years, at least not by the government.\u000aNot-my-prince(ton)s implication that I was overreacting steered me away from sharing my assault with anyone else. I didnt believe that anyone in my misogynistic hometown would listen to or agree with me, so I never mustered enough courage to address the issue.\u000aAnd in a political climate where half the country seems to want to revert back to its bigoted ways, it may also seem like voicing oppression is unfruitful. Its easy to lose motivation in making the world a better place when a scarily large portion of the U.S. seems to be against you and the idea of progress.\u000aOn the contrary, though, it is at a time when groping, sexism, racism and homophobia are normalized that we cant afford to silence our voices. Someone needs to speak up. And someone will listen, and someone will agree.\u000aTo those of you who still believe in equality: Dont let them tell you that you need to change your tone or the way youre going about your movement in order for it to be effective either. Dont let those who are unaffected by Trumps policies, yet still feel entitled to giving their two cents, tell you that your emotions are getting in the way of a rational argument. Just because you cant emotionally remove yourself from your argument doesnt make it any weaker.\u000aIn fact, your emotions are the best proof that oppression is a harmful reality and make the best case for why it shouldnt exist. Oppression is never your fault, and you deserve to be listened to.\u000aSo speak your fucking truth.\u000aCatherine Straus writes the Thursday blog on taking two sides.

VHaving a drink or two a day can be a good thing, at least as far as the heart is concerned. There are nearly 100 studies of large populations that support this  they show consistently that people who drink moderately tend to have fewer heart events and are less likely to die of heart disease.\u000aThe key is moderation. Alcohol can be both tonic and toxin, since excessive drinking can lead to liver problems and other psychological and behavioral issues that impair health. In the latest study presented at the American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans, researchers pinpoint one way that alcohol can benefit the heart  by keeping good cholesterol levels high.\u000aThe study involved more than 80,000 healthy Chinese adults, who answered questions about their drinking habits and who gave blood for analysis four times during the six year study so researchers could measure their HDL as well as liver function and inflammatory markers. Those who reported drinking moderate amounts of alcohol  about one serving a day for women and two for men  had the lowest drop in HDL levels. With age, good cholesterol levels tend to decline, but these people seemed to slow that decline with their drinking. Those who abstained or drank more heavily didnt show the same benefit.\u000aDr. Eric Rimm, director of cardiovascular epidemiology at the T. H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health, says the findings support other studies that have found that at any age, people who drink moderately tend to have higher HDL levels than those who dont. HDL is important for heart health since it can mop up excess LDL, which can build up within blood vessel walls and contribute to plaques that can trigger heart attacks.\u000aIn fact, research suggests that having one or two drinks a day can lower risk of heart events about the same as losing around 30 pounds through diet and exercise. However, he says, Im hesitant to make that comparison, since weight loss is much more beneficial for other health reasons, such as reducing risk of cancer, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Drinking and driving is also a leading cause of health problems and death.\u000aThe author, Shue Huang at Pennsylvania State University, reports that the Chinese population mostly drank beer or spirits, so the study doesnt shed light on the effects of wine, although previous work shows that the ethanol in different alcoholic beverages generally has the same health effects. Almost without exception if you look at fatal and non fatal heart disease, people who drink in moderation have substantially lower rates than people who abstain, he says. All the more reason to raise a glass  but probably not more than that.

VFour percent requested fast-food takeout from chains like McDonald's, Wendy's or KFC.\u000aA  current McDonalds manager took to  Reddit last week and let the Internet ask her anything about her position. What really caught our eye during the AMA was her suggestion for the menu item you most certainly should not order when at the fast food chain. She also revealed that there is indeed a  McDonalds secret menu.\u000aThough the Daily Mail reports a McDonalds U.K. representative refuted the claim that you can order secret menu items, the manager suggested that even if some employees dont know the names of these secret items, you can order them separately and hack your own lunch.\u000aFor those of you who are unfamiliar, the $2 McGangBang is a McChicken sandwich placed inside a McDouble. The Land, Air, and Sea burger (pictured below) is slightly more complicated: It is a Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and McChicken sandwich all stacked. That monster goes for $8.49.\u000aOther gems off the secret menu include the eight-patty  Monster Mac and the  Mc10:35, which is essentially an Egg McMuffin with a cow on top. \u000aShe restates several times that chicken is the worst thing you can order from McDonalds. Whereas beef is produced locally (at least for her McDonalds) and fish is cooked freshly, the chicken is pre-packaged and flown in frozen from Thailand.\u000aOh, and in case you were wondering, anything labeled a "healthy option" just isnt. Best to just go ahead and order your McGangBang with a Diet Coke.

V2014_10_05_Barawe_Offensive_Day1-11.jpg AMISOM Public Information / Flickr Public Domain\u000aRussia appears to be pushing the buttons of many superpowers as the United States just sent troops to Vladimir Putins doorsteps. Furthermore, Syria just likened the continuing conflict to something in between a Cold War and Third World War, which could only spell bad news for the rest of the world. Is there no turning back?\u000aThe Pentagon has reportedly dispatched U.S. troops to Russias doorsteps. These include troops, tanks, helicopters and howitzers in an effort to intimidate Russia and manage its supposed threat.\u000aUS Sends Thousands Of Soldiers To Attack Russia?\u000aU.S. Army officials revealed the colossal build-up of soldiers and heavy armor near Russias border in order to mitigate its supposed growing threat. According to Pentagon bosses, they will be sending thousands of troops that will join NATOs buildup to fight Putins resurgent superpower.\u000aAccording to the Daily Star, there have been war fears since tensions between the West and Russia have been touted as more dangerous than the Cold War on top of the global war concerns that surrounds the conflict in Syria. The concerns may be valid as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in an interview that the Syrian conflict is something that is between the Cold War and Third World War.\u000aWe call it a world war, but its a world war against Syria, tens of countries against us, sending those terrorists money and logistics, whereas our army is only Syrian, so we struggled, the Syrian president explained as quoted by RT.\u000aIf you ask me what the topics would be for a political solution, I dont know, he said. No one has proposed anything.
